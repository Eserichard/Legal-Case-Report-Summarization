<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 1429">In Strazdins, in the matter of DNPW Pty Ltd (subject to DOCA) ACN 107 484 711 v Birch Carroll &amp; Coyle Limited [2009] FCA 731 , Lander J stated:
 
Mr Strazdins was also cross-examined on the opinion the administrators offered to DNPW's creditors that it was in the creditors' interests for the company to execute the DOCA. In particular, Mr Strazdins was asked about his opinion regarding claims that might be available against DNPW's directors for insolvent trading having regard to the administrators' expressed opinion that DNPW was insolvent as at 30 June 2006. He agreed that the administrators expressed an opinion in their report that any return on a claim for insolvent trading, estimated at $500,000, would be to the benefit of the secured creditor. He agreed that assumption was contrary to s 588Yof the Corporations Act . </sentence>
