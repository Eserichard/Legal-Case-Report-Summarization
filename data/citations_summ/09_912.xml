<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 394">Mr Karp also referred the Court to AZAAR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 912 ; (2009) 111 ALD 390 per Finn J for a general summary of the effect of S152 at [6] --- [10]. In particular, at [8]: "(iii) There must be a reasonable willingness and ability by the State and its agents to invoke those laws and mechanisms against the perpetrators of violence: Respondents S152/2003 at [21]; Hovatt, at 511; and this may necessitate examining how State agents act at a 'local level' regardless of the State's 'leaders' good intention': see SZAIX at [37]. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 1">The Minister notes that, by reference to the applicant's written submissions the grounds in the application have essentially merged to form an allegation that the Tribunal did not consider the efficacy of measures introduced to address domestic violence at a local level, in the manner considered in AZAAR v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 912. The Minister submits that the applicant's analysis fundamentally misunderstands and misquotes the Tribunal's finding which acknowledged the applicant's submission that the law had little effect (CB 151 [69]) as an acceptance by the Tribunal that the law had little effect. The Minister submits that the Tribunal was merely summarising the weight of competing independent country information and that there is no inconsistency in the Tribunal's reasoning.  The circumstances in which conduct giving rise to a well-founded fear of harm at the hands of non-State actors may constitute persecution as a result of the unwillingness or inability of the State to provide effective protection was discussed in Khawar as well as Minister for Immigration v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1 and Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000] UKHL 37 ; [2001] 1 AC 489. In AZAAR v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 912 , Finn J summarised the principles to be drawn from those decisions as follows (at [6]-[10]): (i) It is the obligation of a State to provide an adequate or reasonable armoury of laws and other mechanisms capable of providing international standards of protection: Respondent S152/2003 at [27]; Horvath , at 510; against the perpetration of violence on its citizens: Respondents S152/2003 , at [26]. (ii) Those standards cannot provide an "absolute guarantee" of protection: Hovath , at 510; the measures taken to protect the lives and safety of citizens must be "reasonable": Respondents S152/2003 ; but they cannot be expected to protect against "individual and random" incidents of harm: at [119]. (iii) There must be a reasonable willingness and ability by the State and its agents to invoke those laws and mechanisms against the perpetrators of violence: Respondents S152/2003 at [21]; Horvath , at 511; and this may necessitate examining how State agents act at a "local level" regardless of the State's "leaders' good intention": see SZAIX at [37]. (iv) If the State or its agents condone, approve, tolerate: Khawar , [31]; or are indifferent to: Respondents S152/2003 at [119]; the criminal conduct concerned, or are unwilling or unable to afford protection: Horvath at 510-511; Khawar, at [29] --- ... then the requirement that the persecution be by reason of one of the Convention grounds may be satisfied by the motivation of either the criminals or the state [or its agents]: Khawar , at [31]. (v) Proof merely of maladministration, incompetence or ineptitude of State agents would not convert personally motivated domestic violence into persecution on one of the grounds set out in Art 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention: Khawar at [26]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 212">Mr Gibson relied on the decision in AZAAR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 912, 111 ALD 390 to argue that the RRT here should have investigated whether there will be effective state protection for the applicant if he is returned to Zimbabwe. In effect this argument is that the RRT should not have relied on the country information it relied on (Court Book 151.2, 151.5, 152.3 --- 152.5 and 154.5). 
In NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 , the Full Court of the Federal Court decided at [10] as follows:
 
 "In their written submissions, the appellants took exception to a number of findings of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] RRTA 163">The applicant's adviser submitted a copy of Federal Court of Australia decision AZZAR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 912 (19 August 2009) and the US Department of State report, 2008 Human Rights Report: Tonga , 25 February 2009. He repeated the applicant's claims and argued that her situation is similar to the situation discussed in the AZZAR case. He argued that the applicant was a member of a particular social group, that group being 'married woman in Tonga' and she will effectively be denied protection by the State, when subjected to violence by her husband, because of cultural factors which enables husbands to beat their wives with impunity. The adviser argued that information from external sources supports the applicant's claim that her fear of harm is well-founded. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] RRTA 77">A detailed submission on the issue of state protection was provided to the Tribunal after the hearing by RACS. It set out evidence from various sources, which the Tribunal found valuable in its considerations, and referred the Tribunal to AZAAR v MIAC [2009] FCA 912. It was submitted that the level of protection available in Indonesia did not meet international standards as required in MIMA v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 222 CLR 1 , because there was still not a reasonably effective and impartial police force and judicial system. Further, at the local level the criminal justice system would not protect the applicants because of the influence of the applicant wife's relatives. There would be a lack of will to prosecute the persecutors because of the prevalence of police and judicial corruption and the influence of the applicant wife's family. 
Evidence from other sources
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 875">A number of recent decisions have neatly summarised the relevant law in relation to appeals of this kind. Firstly, in AZAAR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship &amp; Refugee Review Tribunal , [13] Finn J at [5] --- [10] set out what his Honour described as the "legal setting" for such appeals. Apart from formally being bound by his Honour's comments, respectfully I adopt them. I set them out below: There has been systematic, recent authoritative analysis of when conduct giving rise to a well founded fear of serious harm at the hands of a non-State actor may constitute persecution because of the unwillingness or inability of the State (or State agents) to discharge its obligation to protect its citizens: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 222 CLR 1 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 48 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 ; Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000] UKHL 37 ; [2001] 1 AC 489 ; see also SZAIX v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448.</sentence>
