<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1054">In the Application of Commonwealth Insurance Holdings Limited and The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited [2007] FCA 1012 at [13] , Edmonds J pointed out that there are two aspects in respect of the protection of the interests of policyholders which arise on such an application. The first is the procedural aspect and the second is a substantive aspect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 669">The authorities under the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth) also point to the importance of the actuarial evidence. For example, in Re Commonwealth Insurance Holdings Limited [2007] FCA 1012 (" Commonwealth Insurance ") at [14], Edmonds J said that the question of whether a policyholder is adversely affected is largely actuarial. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 637">In Application of Commonwealth Insurance Holdings Ltd &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 1012 at [13] , Edmonds J pointed out that there are two aspects in respect of the protection of the interests of policyholders which arise on such an application. The first is the procedural aspects, and the second is a substantive aspect in which the Court is concerned to see that the scheme will not be prejudicial to the interests of policyholders, and that policyholders are properly safeguarded. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1">The Court's discretion is very wide but, as Edmonds J pointed out, "it is not unfettered, and must be exercised on the evidence and having regard to the objects of the Act, principally, the protection of the interests of policyholders and prospective policyholders"; In the Application of Commonwealth Insurance Holdings Ltd and The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [2007] FCA 1012 at [12] . At [13] his Honour identified two aspects to the protection of the interests of policyholders: First, there are the procedural aspects in which the Court is concerned to see that the process undertaken has been properly executed in accordance with the requirements of the Act and the Life Insurance Regulations 1995 (Cth) ('the Regulations'); and Second, there is a substantive aspect in which the Court is concerned to see that the Scheme will not be prejudicial to the interests of policyholders and that policyholders are properly safeguarded, i.e., there is not likely to be any material detriment to policyholders affected by the Scheme (see NuLife Insurance Ltd v Norwich Union Life Australia Ltd [2005] FCA 1635 at [24] per Emmett J; MLC Lifetime Company Ltd &amp; Anor (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1367 at [5] per Bennett J; Colonial Portfolio at [25] per Matthews J) Procedural steps
  Section 3(2) lists the principal means adopted for the achievement of the objects of the Act and includes, in subsection (2)(f), "providing for the supervision of transfers and amalgamations of life insurance business by the Court". As noted above at [14], the Court is directed to have regard to "the interests of policy owners of a company affected by the scheme". Consistent with the principal object of the Act, however, the Court is not directed to consider only the interests of policyholders or to consider the interests as paramount. Their interests must be considered in the context identified in s 3(1). Moreover, it should not be assumed that the interests of policyholders are necessarily identical with their preferences. As Edmonds J observed, in In the Application of Commonwealth Insurance Holdings Ltd and The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [2007] FCA 1012 at [14] : 
 The question of whether policyholders would be adversely affected by the Scheme is largely actuarial and involves a comparison of their security and reasonable expectations without the Scheme with what they would be if the Scheme were implemented. 

This leads me to a consideration of the actuarial reports. Actuarial Reports
