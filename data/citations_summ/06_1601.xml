<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 966">However while there is no obligation on the Court, in cases particularly involving a self-represented litigant it is open to the Court to identify other grounds of appeal which the litigant may have missed, but which present an arguable case. This practice is particularly apparent in migration matters where litigants are commonly not only self-represented, but frequently lack English language skills in attempting to address the Court in respect of an area of law of considerable difficulty. The position can be placed no higher --- I agree with the observations of Madgwick J in SZFNK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1601 at [4] - [5] that no obligation is imposed on the Court to investigate alternative grounds to advance the case of the self-represented litigant. "Satisfaction" of Minister
