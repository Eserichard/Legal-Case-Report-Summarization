<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 448">As well, several recent authorities in this Court provide useful guidance on the interpretation and application of s 31A. In Helal v McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 1462 , I referred to the reasons of Kenny J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Southgate Investments Funds Limited [2010] FCA 1298 , which adopted, at [22], the observations of Sundberg J in Adnunat Pty Ltd v ITW Construction Systems Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 499 , at [37], as indicating how s 31A should be applied. In my assessment of these proceedings I have also considered the useful summary provided by Gilmour J in Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 (" Dandaven ") at [5] and [6] which was relied on by Foster J in Wang v Anying Group Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1500 , at [44]. In Dandaven, Gilmour J said: Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 419">Section 31A permits the Court to make an order giving judgment for a respondent against an applicant in relation to a proceeding if the Court is satisfied that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding: s 31A(2). In making that assessment, the Court need not be satisfied that the proceeding is hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospects of success: s 31A(3). Parliament intended by enacting s 31A to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment or summary dismissal below the level which had been fixed by authorities such as Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125: Deckers Outdoor Corporation Inc v Farley (No 2) [2009] FCA 256 ; (2008) 176 FCR 33 at 3; Dandaven v Hanbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [5] . However, the Court has said that the Court should be slow to dismiss a claim under s 31A in case such an order would create a miscarriage of justice. There is a continuing reluctance to deprive a person of that person's right to seek to have the Court adjudicate on an existing dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FWA 1894">[22] Mr Kruse dealt with Sydney Water's alternative submission that irrespective of jurisdiction, FWA would not, as a matter of discretion, arbitrate the dispute. He said that the Union's application was not frivolous or vexatious and had reasonable prospects of success. He relied on the principles of 'strike out' motions: see Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955. [23] Mr Kruse also dealt with the substantive merits of the application, which, as I said earlier, are not relevant at this stage of the proceedings. Mr Kruse submitted that the Agreement specifically refers to job evaluation as an available mechanism for the assignment of pay levels and that there is nothing remarkable about the Tribunal receiving evidence about job evaluation results and processes. I have no evidence presently before me which would permit FWA to form a preliminary view as to the merits of this dispute, which would lead to a refusal to arbitrate the matter. What I can positively conclude, at this point, is that the Union has an obvious and serious issue to be tried. In this respect, I rely on the comments of Gilmour J in Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 , where his Honour said at par 6: 
 
 Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: 
 
 (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings; 
 
 (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; 
 
 (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; 
 
 (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial; 
 
 (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FMCA 144">It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial; (h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects; (i) in determining if there are real issues of fact in issue so as to preclude summary judgment the courts must draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party.

As s 31A requires in effect a prediction as to the outcome of a claim, the court should be more reluctant to summarily dismiss a claim where real questions of fact and credit arise. In those cases, the court will not have all material evidence before it until trial, the credit of important witnesses will not have been tested and it will as a consequence be very difficult if not impossible to fairly assess the prospects of the claim: see Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [20] (Finkelstein J); Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [6] (Gilmour J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2011] FMCA 80">Moreover, as Sundberg J stated in Adnunat (at [37]): In assessing whether there are reasonable prospects of success, the court should draw all reasonable inferences (but only reasonable inferences) in favour of the non-moving party: see Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [132] (Gordon J). Moreover, where the evidence on a summary judgment application is of an ambivalent character, there will be a real issue of fact and therefore reasonable prospects of success for the purposes of s 31A: see Boston 236 ALR at [45]; Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [73] (Rares J) and [130] (Gordon J). The moving party bears the onus of persuading the court that its opponent has no reasonable prospects of success: see Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [127] (Gordon J); Boston 236 ALR at [45].

<sentence id="cs21" from="[2009] FMCA 959">Insofar as the respondents seek summary dismissal, in White Industries Aust Ltd and Another v Federal Commissioner of Taxation and Another (2007) 160 FCR 298 ; [2007] FCA 511 at [58] --- [59], Lindgren J suggested that a test in terms such as in rule 13.10 was a test of whether the prospect was real and not fanciful or merely arguable (also see Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd (ACN 107 746 798) and Others (2008) 250 ALR 82 ; [2008] FCA 1304 and Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1283 ; (2008) 78 IPR 51). However in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 at [59] , Greenwood J suggested that the court would rarely be satisfied that there was no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a claim, except in the most transparent of cases, on the strength of the conclusion that an applicant's statement of claim was deficient in whole or in part, having regard to the fact that leave to replead might reveal material or facts, within a properly identified legal framework, that on proof, gave rise to a recognised remedy. In Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 Gilmour J at [6] pointed out that in a case where evidence could " give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2009] FCA 965">The tests have been reviewed in many authorities and require little amplification. There have been numerous decisions dealing with the proper approach on a motion of this nature. A convenient collection of the relevant principles was set out by Gilmour J in Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [5] - [6] where his Honour said: 
 5 Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] . 

 
 6 Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2009] FCA 612">Mr Sharbutt's application for summary judgment is made under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the FCA"). In determining such an application, the principles to be applied are not in dispute: see Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [5] - [6]: Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] . Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2009] FCA 499">However, where the moving party establishes a prima facie case for summary judgment, the opposing party must be able to point to "specific factual or evidentiary disputes that make a trial necessary": see Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [127] (Gordon J). As s 31A requires in effect a prediction as to the outcome of a claim, the court should be more reluctant to summarily dismiss a claim where real questions of fact and credit arise. In those cases, the court will not have all material evidence before it until trial, the credit of important witnesses will not have been tested and it will as a consequence be very difficult if not impossible to fairly assess the prospects of the claim: see Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [20] (Finkelstein J); Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [6] (Gilmour J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2009] FCA 426">At the outset it should be recognised that s 31A has been said to be a provision which " lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment ": Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [5] per Gilmour J. A " reasonable prospect of success " for the purposes of the section is one which is real and not fanciful or merely arguable: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [59] [2007] FCA 511 ; , 160 FCR 298 at 312 per Lindgren J; Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1305 at [41] , [2008] FCA 1305 ; 250 ALR 82 at 92. And, unlike an application pursuant to O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) that a matter be struck out, where it is the adequacy of the pleadings which is in issue, an action pursuant to s 31A " not only permits, but requires, a consideration of matters outside the pleadings ": Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd (in liq) [2008] FCA 1920 at [3] to [8] [2008] FCA 1920 ; , 252 ALR 41 at 43 to 45 per Finkelstein J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2009] FMCA 266">Having said that, it remains the case that: the court should approach an application for summary dismissal with caution: Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [6] ; summary judgment should not be granted if there is a genuine factual dispute between the parties, including disputes about matters of fact and degree: Boston at [45] and Dandaven at [6]; and as was said in Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCA 875: the court must be careful not to do an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings, or denying an applicant an opportunity to ventilate their case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2009] FCA 363">The law on s 31A FCA has been exhaustively analysed. While there is no doubt that the bar has been lowered for summary dismissal, it is still a serious matter to dismiss a proceeding at an early stage. None of those cases would suggest otherwise. To those I would also adopt the observations of Graham J in J F Keir Pty Limited v Sparks [2008] FCA 611 at [9] - [15] and Gilmour J in Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955. It is clear that, despite the bar being lowered, the Court should approach the question of summary dismissal with considerable caution. For all the reasons expressed in these authorities, as I apprehend it, the lowering of the bar or relaxing of the standard was intended only to give a power which the Court may exercise in the more obvious instances. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs29" from="[2008] FCA 1413">7 The test to be applied pursuant to s 31A of the Act requires the Court to consider whether the applicant has "no reasonable prospect" of successfully prosecuting the proceeding. This does not require the proceedings to be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospects of success. The applicable principles are found in Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [6] . 8 The material before the Court is the same as that considered by me in Wills . It is convenient to adopt by reference, mutatis mutandis, that same reasoning here.</sentence>
