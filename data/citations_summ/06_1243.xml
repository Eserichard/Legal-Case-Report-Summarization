<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 63">5 On 19 September 2006, the primary judge determined that, subject to matters of extinguishment of native title, the Noongar people hold native title rights and interests in relation to the area of the separate proceeding, other than off-shore islands and waters below the low-water mark. His Honour dismissed Mr Bodney's claims insofar as they were concerned with the area of the separate proceeding: Bennell v State of Western Australia [2006] FCA 1243 ; (2006) 153 FCR 120 ( Bennell ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 46">5 The purpose of the Attorney's intervention was to submit that the course set in Full Court native title appeals determined since Yorta Yorta --- namely De Rose v South Australia [2003] FCAFC 286 ; (2003) 133 FCR 325 , De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 and Northern Territory v Alyawarr [2005] FCAFC 135 ; (2005) 145 FCR 442 --- had departed from what had been laid down in Yorta Yorta . It was said that there had been a similar departure in first instance decisions: Sampi v Western Australia [2005] FCA 777 , Rubibi Community (No 5) v Western Australia [2005] FCA 1025 and Bennell v Western Australia [2006] FCA 1243. The last three decisions are currently under appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 31">These circumstances pose a particular difficulty for the Claim groups. They bear the onus of proving that the group rights and interests they claim derive from laws and customs as they existed at sovereignty, that is, at 1829. Lack of evidence in this respect tells against them, and in favour of those who oppose their Claims. Yet substantial written records relating to Aboriginal people in the Goldfields do not begin until the 1890s. Contrast the recent case of Bennell v Western Australia [2006] FCA 1243 ; (2006) 153 FCR 120 in which European settlement and accompanying written records occurred soon after sovereignty. Of course, it should not be assumed that if the Goldfields had been settled in 1829, a record of the local position at that time would necessarily have supported the present Claims: it may have defeated them. The point is simply that contemporaneous records do not exist, and any evidentiary vacuum works against the Claim groups. </sentence>
