<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 555">The decision about the "kind of death" is made on the balance of probabilities [11] . It is not made by applying s 120 or s 120A of the Act or any SoPs, but is made independently of them [12] . In carrying out the enquiry, we should regard the death certificate as informative but not conclusive [13] .  The expression "kind of death" means medical cause of death [8] . There can be more than one medical cause of death [9] . In seeking to identify the medical cause of death, it is necessary to focus not on the terminal event or condition, but on the underlying cause of the death [10] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 540">Initially the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("AAT") had determined that the kind of death suffered by the Veteran was that of heart failure and kidney failure. That decision was, both on appeal to the Federal Court at first instance and on further appeal to the Full Court, held to be an error of law. See Repatriation Commission v Hill [2009] FCA 270 and Hill v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCAFC 91. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 418">According to the recent judgment of Cowdroy J in Repatriation Commission v Hill [2009] FCA 270 ('Hill'), the first enquiry the tribunal should make is whether a SoP exists in respect of the 'particular kind of ...death' suffered by the veteran. We have identified the applicable SoP concerning malignant neoplasm of the anal canal and also considered Mr Allen's condition in accordance with the SoP prevailing at the date of our decision: See Repatriation Commission v Gorton [2001] FCA 1194 ; (2001) 110 FCR 321. </sentence>
