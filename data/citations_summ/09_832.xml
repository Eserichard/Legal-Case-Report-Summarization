<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1260">For an understanding of events to date these reasons would need to be read with earlier judgments in Verge v Devere Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 832 ; (2009) 258 ALR 464 and Verge v Devere Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 1048. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1140">Betfair submitted that the extent of the privilege is limited to evidence of express or implied admissions ( Verge v Devere Holdings Pty Ltd (2009) 258 ALR 464 ; [2009] FCA 832 at [5] , [35], [39] and [50], Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v ABB Power Transmission [2003] FCA 626 at [26] , Austotel Management Pty Ltd v Jamieson (1995) 57 FCR 411 , Quad Consulting Pty Ltd v David R Bleakley &amp; Associates Pty Ltd (1990) 27 FCR 86 , Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd v Andersen [2001] QCA 115 ; [2002] 1 Qd R 233 at [41] ). The decisions referred to by Racing NSW ( Mercantile Mutual Custodians Pty Ltd v Village/Nine Network Restaurants &amp; Bars Pty Ltd [2001] 1 Qd R 276 and Alstom Power Ltd v Yokogawa Australia Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] SASC 100) are not authority to the contrary. There is no evidence of express or implied admissions in Mr Price's affidavit. In any event, the present proceeding does not relate to the same subject-matter as the dispute between Racing NSW and Tabcorp. The evidence is only relevant in this proceeding as evidence of the relationship between Racing NSW and Tabcorp not for the truth of any admission. The relationship between Racing NSW and Tabcorp is relevant because Betfair alleges that the conditions on its approval to publish NSW race fields requiring payment of 1.5% of its turnover are protectionist and discriminatory in favour of Tabcorp, the NSW operator and against Betfair, the inter-State operator (see Verge at [30]). Putting it another way, the communications are relevant for the fact they were made not their truth and thus the privilege does not apply, consistent with the observation in Tenstat v Permanent Trustee Aust Ltd (1992) 28 NSWLR 625 at 633 that: 
 
 It [the privilege] does not however extend to preclude the proof of communications or statements relied on, not as an express or implied admission, but as an objective act having legal consequences.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1048">In previous reasons ( Verge v Devere Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 832) I have broadly described the nature of the dispute. For present purposes it is sufficient to say that the nature of the amendment proposed by Castleworld is to contend that the provisions of s 120 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (BA) do not displace the provisions of the Transfer of Land Act 1893 (WA) (TLA) in relation to indefeasibility. Castleworld says that absent fraud, the indefeasibility provisions of the TLA remain paramount. Castleworld contends that s 9 BA has the effect that the provisions of s 120 BA which render void as against a trustee in bankruptcy certain transactions, do not affect the indefeasibility regime of the TLA as this statutory regime is not dealt with expressly or by necessary implication in the BA. </sentence>
