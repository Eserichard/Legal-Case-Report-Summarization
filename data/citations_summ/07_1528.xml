<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWSC 347">


64 Ms Katzmann SC submitted that the Tribunal's conclusion at paragraph [17] was open on the evidence, and could not be considered irrational or so unreasonable that no reasonable or rational decision maker could have made it. She submitted that there is nothing irrational in a conclusion that, during a period of nearly an hour, when both the Plaintiff and Miss Burn were at the same place and when there was no impediment to verbal or written communication, it was practicable for the Plaintiff to provide Miss Burn with the additional information about his fees, that he would have known but she did not. Ms Katzmann SC submitted that the question of Wednesbury unreasonableness usually applies to cases of judicial review of abuse of discretionary powers: Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning v Rosemount Estates Pty Limited (1996) 91 LGERA 31 at 42-44; Minister for Immigration v Eshetu [1999] 197 CLR 611 at [122]- [126]. It is a finding to be made "in extremis" : BHP Billiton Direct Reduced Iron Pty Limited v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1528 at [148] . </sentence>
