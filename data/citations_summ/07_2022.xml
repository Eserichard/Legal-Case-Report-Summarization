<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] HCA 50">The first was to construe the word "provision" as a reference to the substance and effect of one or more clauses of the contract, rather than to the clause itself. The second was to read the section as saying that the provision, to the extent that it had the stipulated effect, was void. After referring to the similar operation of other provisions of the Act [45] and to authorities relating to the operation of s 68(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) [46] , his Honour said that [47] : 

 
 
 "the purpose of s 45 is achieved by rendering a provision void to the extent and only to the extent that it has the effect stipulated in s 45(1). " 
 

 
 He concluded that the language of s 45 did not reveal "an intention to exclude severance" [48] . McLure JA dealt separately with this question, and in substance agreed with the Chief Justice [49] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] WASCA 31">101 In Ruaro v Ferrari [2007] FCA 2022 , Emmett J held that s 68 renders a term of a contract void only to the extent that it purports to do or has the effect of doing the things described in s 68. It does not render a term that has that effect void for all purposes: [52], [85]. A similar approach seems to be inherent in what was said by Mildren J in Renehan v Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation Ltd [2006] NTSC 4 ; (2006) 17 NTLR 83 [81]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 174">2 The "precise concatenation of circumstances" which resulted in the destruction of Seaquest (see Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963] UKHL 8 ; [1963] AC 837 at 853, 856) may have been unusual and unforeseeable, but the learned primary judge, Emmett J, found that the relevant risk was known and foreseeable: Ruaro v Ferrari [2007] FCA 2022. </sentence>
