<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 363">In the latter case the general rule is that there must be a material change in circumstances or the discovery of new material which could not reasonably have been put before the Court on the earlier application ( Brimaud at 46). (2) There is a debate in the authorities between approaches that are more and less permissive. Nevertheless the approach generally adopted at first instance accords with that of Goldberg J in P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (No 2) (2009) 255 ALR 466 ; [2009] FCA 413 at [49, namely, that an applicant seeking to vary a substantive interlocutory order made after a contested hearing must persuade the Court that: 
 

...one or more of the following factors has occurred or is satisfied: 
 
 
 (a) there is new material or new evidence which was not available, or reasonably available, to them at the time the orders were made ...; 
 (b) there has been a material change in the circumstances since those orders were made; 
 (c) there are exceptional circumstances which warrant re-consideration of the matter...; and 
 (d) as a matter of discretion, the justice of the matter requires that the applicants be allowed to revisit the matter....

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 100">Colliers also claims that Arizona's motion is tantamount to an abuse of process in that it effectively seeks a second hearing of its unsuccessful motion for determination of separate questions of law and that the overarching purpose of s 37M of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Court Act') would be defeated if the Court entertained Arizona's motion. Colliers rely upon the majority judgment in DA Christie Pty Ltd v Baker [1996] 2 VR 582 ; Nominal Defendant v Manning [2000] NSWCA 80 ; (2000) 50 NSWLR 139 at [71] - [72]; Fletcher v Besser [2010] NSWCA 30 at [17] per Sackville AJA, and AON Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University (2009) 239 CLR 175 in support of the submission that, consistent with s 37M of the Court Act, the Court should dismiss Arizona's application. Reliance is also placed on P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (No 2) [2009] FCA 413 ; (2009) 255 ALR 466 at [49] per Goldberg J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1093">But, as the cases show, a judge cannot simply reconsider what he/she has found on an interlocutory application whenever he/she wishes. The circumstances in which a judge can (or should) reopen an issue (apart from applications dealing with matters of simple procedure) are relatively limited. While the circumstances are not closed, ordinarily what is required is either (1) new material or new evidence not reasonably available when the order was made; (2) a material change in circumstances; or (3) some other exceptional circumstance: P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (No 2) [2009] FCA 413 ; 255 ALR 466 , [49]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] VCAT 1126">In the Federal Court, Goldberg J. in P. Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (No. 2) [2009] FCA 413 ; (2009) 255 ALR 466 interpreted (at para. [49]) the authorities, including Christie and Manning as identifying four circumstances, one or more of which must have occurred or be satisfied before such a second application should be countenanced:
 
(a) there is new material or new evidence which was not available to the applicant at the time that the orders in the first application were made;
 
(b) there has been a material change in the circumstances since those orders were made;
 
(c) there are exceptional circumstances which warrant the reconsideration of the matter;
 
(d) as a matter of discretion, the justice of the matter required that the applicant be allowed to revisit it. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 372">This application is an application for precisely the same order, that is a stay of the costs order made by Collier J, which the applicant already agitated before Reeves J and which Reeves J dismissed. The circumstances engage the principles of abuse of process which are critical to the administration of justice. As set out in the respondent's outline of written submissions filed on 12 April 2010, there are important considerations of justice which inform the approach of a court to a second interlocutory application for the same relief when an earlier interlocutory application has been dismissed. Consistent with those submissions, I adopt the principles as summarised by Goldberg J in P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (No 2) (2009) 255 ALR 466 ; [2009] FCA 413 at [49] . His Honour concluded that a second interlocutory application for the same relief might not be an abuse of process where: - (i) there is new material or new evidence which was not available to the moving party at the time the orders were made, (ii) there has been a material change in the circumstances since those orders were made, (iii) there are exceptional circumstances which warrant the reconsideration of the matter or, (iv) as a matter of discretion, the justice of the matter requires that the applicant be allowed to revisit the matter. </sentence>

 [A]t the end of the day, it is a matter for the discretion of the Court.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 232">This letter is written from an abundance of caution in the unusual circumstances that the Applicants will not be aware of "the material and relevant facts and circumstances" bearing on the determination of XX's application that the document produced under subpoena should not be inspected by the Applicants. 
 

 
 
 It is the Applicants' view that if: 
 

 
 
 (a) XX is an employee of Brookfield Multiplex Ltd or any of its subsidiaries or other related entities; and/or 
 

 
 
 (b) XX's legal costs are being paid for or contributed to by Brookfield Multiplex Ltd or any related entity and/or its insurer; 
 

 
 
 that either such circumstance would be a matter which XX was obliged to disclose to the Court as part of his duty of full disclosure and candour arising from the ex parte and in camera nature of the hearing: see P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v ASIC &amp; Ors (No. 2) [2009] FCA 413 ; (2009) 255 ALR 466 at 502 to 505. 
 

 
 
 We anticipate that as XX's solicitor you will be either unwilling or unable to provide confirmation one way or another whether either of the circumstances referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) above exist. In these circumstances, we propose to draw this correspondence to the attention of the Court and leave it to you and the Court to determine whether and to what extent any such matter ought properly be disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 121">The question whether the interlocutory orders should now be varied in light of the true factual position has to be determined by reference to the relevant principles. Those principles were not in dispute. A court has jurisdiction to vary or set aside any interlocutory order but the re-litigation of issues already decided, even on an interlocutory basis, is undesirable having regard to the need for finality ( Brimaud v Honeysett Instant Print Pty Ltd (1988) 217 ALR 44 at 46). The "overriding principle governing the approach of the court to interlocutory applications is that the court should do whatever the interests of justice require in the particular circumstances of the case" ( Brimaud at 46). The interests of justice should be assessed having regard to the nature of the interlocutory order in question. Interlocutory orders that are merely procedural or made by consent without any contest are different from substantive orders made after a contested hearing and intended to operate until the final hearing. In the latter case the general rule is that there must be a material change in circumstances or the discovery of new material which could not reasonably have been put before the court on the earlier application ( Brimaud at 46). There is a debate in the authorities between approaches that are more and less permissive. Nevertheless the approach generally adopted at first instance accords with that of Goldberg J in P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (No 2) (2009) 255 ALR 466 ; [2009] FCA 413 at [49] , namely, that an applicant seeking to vary a substantive interlocutory order made after a contested hearing must persuade the Court that: 
 
 ...one or more of the following factors has occurred or is satisfied: 
 

 
 
 (a) there is new material or new evidence which was not available, or reasonably available, to them at the time the orders were made ...;
 (b) there has been a material change in the circumstances since those orders were made;
 (c) there are exceptional circumstances which warrant re-consideration of the matter...; and
 (d) as a matter of discretion, the justice of the matter requires that the applicants be allowed to revisit the matter.... 
 

 Pivotel's submissions

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 855">The Prasads also submit that the vacation of the hearing date will severely undermine the orderly allocation of business in the Court. They rely upon the fact that on 30 July 2009 RHG sought aN adjournment of the hearing date and that such application was refused. The Prasads submit that in accordance with the principles referred to by the High Court of Australia in Aon Services Australia Limited v Australia National University [2009] HCA 27 and P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd (ACN 004 743 408) and Another v Australian Securities and Investments Commission and Others (No 2) [2009] FCA 413 ; (2009) 255 ALR 466 the Court should not exercise its discretion in granting any adjournment which will delay the ultimate disposition of the proceedings and that RHG must show that there has been a material change in circumstances since the last request for an adjournment was rejected. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCA 779">There is a considerable background to the applicants' motion and this proceeding which is set out in my earlier ruling on 28 April 2009: P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (No 2) [2009] FCA 413 ; (2009) 255 ALR 466. I do not propose to rehearse it in detail and I incorporate that ruling in these reasons. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FCA 704">It was nevertheless submitted on behalf of SMS that the amended statement of claim was a transparent attempt to re-litigate issues which have already been determined against Dr Windsor: '...proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if, notwithstanding that the circumstances of the case do not give rise to an estoppel, their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it is sought to litigate anew a case which has already been disposed of by earlier proceedings' ( Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ at 393). Reference was also made to Nominal Defendant v Manning [2000] NSWCA 80 ; (2000) 50 NSWLR 139 per Heydon JA at 155 --- 157 [70] --- [73] and per Foster A-JA at 167 [122] --- [123] and P. Dawson Nominees v ASIC (No. 2) [2009] FCA 413 ; (2009) 255 ALR 466 at [36] --- [49]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] WASC 147">29 ASIC applied for, and was granted, a stay on production of the subpoenaed documents pending a possible appeal. ASIC then filed a motion seeking leave to appeal and seeking the imposition of certain confidentiality orders. The parties, in preparation for the appeal, agreed to the imposition of a Special Counsel Regime. In essence, the regime allowed Special Counsel appointed by the first applicant and Multiplex to have access to confidential material filed by ASIC on the leave application that included the disputed documents and the confidential appendix to the reasons of the judge at first instance. Special Counsel signed confidentiality undertakings that they would not disclose any of the confidential material to any person - including their instructing solicitors and clients. The regime also provided that Special Counsel would take no further part in the proceeding should ASIC's claim for public interest immunity be upheld on appeal: P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (No 2) [2009] FCA 413 , [26].</sentence>
