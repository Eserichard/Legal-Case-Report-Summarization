<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 248">All these matters are apparent in documents that were before Comcare when the reconsideration decision in respect of Mr Vidler's claim was made on 5 March 2009 [38] . Having regard to what has been said about requirements for notice and claim in respect of an injury in Abrahams v Comcare [39] and Sellick v Australian Postal Corporation [40] , it is arguable, at least, that the information before Comcare when it reconsidered Mr Vidler's initial claim was sufficient to constitute notice and claim in respect of a new or aggravation injury arising as a result of the termination of Mr Vidler's home-based work arrangement.  Furthermore, a section 14 determination involves five essential components concerning: the giving of notice; the making of a claim; the status of the 'employee'; the occurrence of an 'injury'; and whether the injury results in death, incapacity for work, or impairment [47] . For liability to be enlivened under section 14 each of these components must be satisfied. While the legislation does not impose a temporal limit, it is clear enough that consideration of section 14 issues requires consideration of past events and related evidence. Clearly there are temporal elements in respect of the giving of notice and the making of a claim that may require one to consider the state of the evidence at a particular time. Nevertheless, one should not too readily assume a rigid approach. The giving of notice and the making of a claim may take a number of forms and may occur at various times [48] . This does not limit the Tribunal's consideration, on review, to the particular time when the earlier decisions were made, or to the dates that were determined by earlier decision-makers. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] AATA 114">Mr Richards referred to [53, 56 and 57] of Bennett J's decision in Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 ; (2008) 101 ALD 245 in support of his argument that because the Respondent had not had the opportunity of reviewing a claim for nature and conditions , the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain such a claim by Mr Szabo. He referred to Bennett J's statements as follows from Sellick : 
 
 53 In Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 , Madgwick J recognised that different descriptions can be given of the one injury and said at [18] that 'a broad, generous and practical interpretation' should be made to recognise the understanding of the lay person making the claim and different levels of medical advice and to understand whether the lay person completing it was asserting a different injury to that notified. The Tribunal said that, in applying the principles in Abrahams, it was satisfied that the proper interpretation of the claim made by Mr Sellick was for 'an injury which caused pain in the upper back, which included, but was not limited to, pain in the area of the right scapula'. Accordingly, the Tribunal determined that although Mr Sellick did not then suffer the effects of the soft tissue injury to the right shoulder, it could proceed to consider whether he continued to suffer the effects of the aggravation of the degenerative condition of his spine and the sprain of the interspinous ligament.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] AATA 103">I think that a claim would be sufficient if it identifies the particular type(s) of compensation that is sought, and it would not be necessary for the claimant to identify the particular sections in the SRC Act that provide for the type(s) of compensation being claimed. Further, I consider that claims for compensation should not be interpreted in a technical or narrow manner; to do so would be inconsistent with the beneficial nature of the SRC Act, and with Comcare's responsibility under s 72(a) to be "guided by equity from a good conscience and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities" . I am mindful also of the comments of Madgwick J in Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 at [18] when he formulated propositions relating to the construction of documents purporting to be a notice of injury under s 53 of the SRC Act. These propositions included the following: 
 
 "2. In deciding what injury it is, as to which a claimant has given notice, the purposes of giving notice must be borne in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] AATA 780">Counsel formulated his submissions by reference to principles that are enunciated in Re Filsell and Comcare [2009] AATA 90 ; (2009) 109 ALD 198. I there said, at [33], that applications for dismissal under s 42B should be approached according to the following principles: 
 
 "(a) The word "frivolous" in combination with "vexatious" is a technical legal term, which means that there is no legal basis for the proceedings; it does not necessarily connote that an applicant has acted frivolously in bringing proceedings: Pitt v OneSteel Reinforcing Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 923 at [9] . 
 (b) The expression "vexatious" can include proceedings brought with the intention of annoying or embarrassing or harassing the other party, or for some collateral purpose other than having the court or tribunal adjudicate on the issues raised by the proceedings, or, irrespective of the motive of the litigant, if the proceedings are "so obviously untenable or manifestly groundless as to be utterly hopeless": Attorney-General v Wentworth ( 1988) 14 NSWLR 481 at 491 per Roden J, or if the proceedings have "no reasonable prospect at all of success": Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 at [24] ; [2006] FCA 1829 at [24] , per Madgwick J. 
 (c) The power of the tribunal to dismiss proceedings under s 42B is a power that should be used cautiously. Unless the tribunal is satisfied that the application is frivolous or vexatious in the sense referred to in subparas (a) and (b) above, an applicant should not be denied the right to have the tribunal review the decision in issue on the merits, by conducting a hearing de novo and considering the evidence that the applicant can properly adduce at that hearing: General Steel Industries Inc v Cmr.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] AATA 521">We should add that we consider it to be within our jurisdiction to determine the matter on the basis of Dr Hilton's current diagnosis of Mr Bock's condition. On the authorities, we note that where there has been an "evolution" of diagnosis, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider the revised diagnosis of the claimed condition [14] . Furthermore, in a report which was before the delegate at the time of the original determination in relation to liability, Dr Hilton diagnosed Mr Bock's condition as "major depression" [15] . Therefore that diagnosis of the condition was embraced by Mr Bock's claim in any event.

7. This approach is consistent with that taken by Madgwick J in Abrahams v Comcare [1] when considering whether Mr Abrahams had given a " notice in writing of the injury ... to the relevant authority ... as soon as practicable after the employee becomes aware of the injury " as required by s 53(1)(a) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 .</sentence>

He also submitted it was clear from those authorities that those administering the SRC Act are obliged to determine entitlements having regard to current medical evidence, even where this may dictate a conclusion which is different from decisions made previously. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] AATA 190">There can, however, be grey areas where, for example, a changed description may simply be a more accurate diagnosis of what is really the same injury or condition. 17. In Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 at paragraph 18 Madgwick J set out some "legal propositions" which should be applied in considering this issue including:
 
 
 "5. There is not always a bright dividing line available to assist in the decision where the powers of the kinds mentioned are being exercised in aid of a better understanding of a claim made in respect of an injury of which notice has been given, or whether the changed notice is sufficiently fundamental to indicate that a different injury is being asserted, which would require a different decision from a decision in respect of the originally claimed injury under consideration. In determining that matter, considerations of the purpose of giving notice of injury, and more generally of enabling the decision matter of having their opportunity to investigate the claim properly, are paramount.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FCAFC 146">7 There is something to be said for the proposition that the notice of injury initially given by the applicant, namely "pain in the right shoulder" was, by the subsequent presentation of various medical certificates and medical reports, sufficient to have constituted a claim that the pain in his right shoulder flowed either from soft tissue injury in the shoulder, or from aggravation of a degenerative spinal condition, or from chronic sprained interspinous ligament, or from a combination of those conditions: see eg the remarks of Madgwick J in Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 at [18] and at [21], and in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Hannaford [2006] FCAFC 87 ; (2006) 151 FCR 253 at [57] . They were matters addressed in the first AAT decision. However, that is not what was decided by Bennett J in the decision referred to in [3] above, and the AAT was bound to give effect to her Honour's conclusions, in the absence of any appeal from her Honour's orders. I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justices Mansfield and McKerracher. Associate:

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCA 1057">Section 14 of the 1988 Act provides that Comcare is liable to pay compensation " in respect of an injury suffered by an employee ... ". Section 53 requires notice to be given " of the injury " and s 54 provides that compensation is not payable " unless a claim for compensation is made ..." that complies with certain requirements set out in that section. Section 54 is a procedural prerequisite to an entitlement to compensation: Lang , supra , at [43]. The claim as made by a claimant is to be given " a broad, generous and practical interpretation ...": Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 at [18] , [2006] FCA 1829 ; 93 ALD 147 at 152; Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick , supra , at [55]. Section 24 provides for the payment of compensation for " permanent impairment " and s 25 provides for the " interim payment of compensation " pending the final determination of a claimant's disability. Section 26 provides that " an amount of compensation payable to an employee under section 24 or 25 ... shall be paid to the employee within 30 days after the date of the assessment of the amount ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FamCA 465">The expression "vexatious" can include proceedings brought with the intention of annoying or embarrassing or harassing the other party, or for some collateral purpose other than having the court or tribunal adjudicate on the issues raised by the proceedings, or, irrespective of the motive of the litigant, if the proceedings are "so obviously untenable or manifestly groundless as to be utterly hopeless" ( Attorney-General v Wentworth (1988) 14 NSWLR 481 at 491 per Roden J, or if the proceedings have "no reasonable prospect at all of success": Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147at [24], per Madgwick J. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] AATA 90">I think that applications for dismissal under s 42B should be approached according to the following principles. 
(a) The word "frivolous" in combination with "vexatious" is a technical legal term, which means that there is no legal basis for the proceedings; it does not necessarily connote that an applicant has acted frivolously in bringing proceedings: Pitt v OneSteel Reinforcing Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 923 at [9] . (b) The expression "vexatious" can include proceedings brought with the intention of annoying or embarrassing or harassing the other party, or for some collateral purpose other than having the court or tribunal adjudicate on the issues raised by the proceedings, or, irrespective of the motive of the litigant, if the proceedings are "so obviously untenable or manifestly groundless as to be utterly hopeless" : Attorney-General v Wentworth (1988) 14 NSWLR 481 at 491 per Roden J, or if the proceedings have "no reasonable prospect at all of success" : Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 at [24] , per Madgwick J. (c) The power of the tribunal to dismiss proceedings under s 42B is a power that should be used cautiously. Unless the tribunal is satisfied that the application is frivolous or vexatious in the sense referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, an applicant should not be denied the right to have the tribunal review the decision in issue on the merits, by conducting a hearing de novo and considering the evidence that the applicant can properly adduce at that hearing: General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129 --- 130. As mentioned in paragraph 9 above, Mr Filsell's 2006 claim for work-related stress refers to depression and anxiety, whereas his 1997 claim made no reference to depression, and the supporting medical certificate referred to an anxiety disorder but not also to depression. Nevertheless, the claim form that he lodged in 1997 was expressed in terms broad enough to incorporate depression, and that diagnosis had been made by Dr Black prior to the settlement of the claim. It follows from Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 at [18] that decision-makers have the power to consider a claim better explaining a claim previously made, provided there is not a fundamental change in the nature of the injury asserted. It is clear from the documents before me, to which I have referred above, that Mr Filsell's 1997 claim was extended so as to include a claim for depression, and that claim was the subject of the competing opinions expressed by Doctors Black and Ewer prior to the settlement arrived at by the parties. In those circumstances I am satisfied that the tribunal had jurisdiction in the earlier proceedings to determine the claim for depression. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] AATA 1155">Ms Henderson who represented the Respondent submitted that as there had been no notification of any injury in 2004 pursuant to section 53 of the Act, and no decision made regarding any 2004 injury or aggravation, only the 2007 claim could be before the Tribunal, ( Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] AATA 1103">Both parties have submitted that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the permanent impairment claims. We are satisfied that we do have this jurisdiction as Ms Dufty referred to headaches and myalgia in the original permanent impairment claim form This is in accordance with the principles set out by the Federal Court in Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] AATA 553">In Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 Madgwick J decided that this tribunal had jurisdiction to review a decision by Comcare rejecting a claim for right carpal tunnel syndrome, notwithstanding that after Comcare had rejected this claim at a primary level and again on reconsideration, the applicant reformulated his claim to encompass a broader right arm and shoulder condition. At [18] his Honour set out the following legal propositions relevant to the tribunal's jurisdiction.

<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] AATA 374">We further note that the case of Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 says it is open to an applicant to change the diagnosis or to proceed with a claim for liability and compensation despite arguing that what is wrong with the applicant is something otherwise than described when compensation was first claimed. What is essential is to demonstrate an injury. While we have formed an opinion on balance about Mr King's current diagnosis, we have proceeded to consider the claim in the context of the diagnoses of cannabis abuse and alcohol abuse as well as of major depressive disorder. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FCA 236">55 In Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 , Madgwick J recognised that different descriptions can be given of the one injury and said at [18] that ' a broad, generous and practical interpretation ' should be made to recognise the understanding of the lay person making the claim and different levels of medical advice and to understand whether the lay person completing it was asserting a different injury to that notified. The Tribunal said that, in applying the principles in Abrahams , it was satisfied that the proper interpretation of the claim made by Mr Sellick was for ' an injury which caused pain in the upper back, which included, but was not limited to, pain in the area of the right scapula '. Accordingly, the Tribunal determined that although Mr Sellick did not then suffer the effects of the soft tissue injury to the right shoulder, it could proceed to consider whether he continued to suffer the effects of the aggravation of the degenerative condition of his spine and the sprain of the interspinous ligament. Based on the views of Drs Griffith and Cassar, the Tribunal found that his duties are likely to continue to aggravate those conditions and to make the conditions symptomatic. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs21" from="[2007] AATA 1976">Our decision is in accordance with the decision of the Federal Court Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 in which the Court said: 
 "In construing a document purporting to be a notice of injury under the Act, a broad, generous and practical interpretation should be made, consistent with both a beneficial purposes of the Act and the likelihood that laypeople of differing levels of education, different levels of medical advice and different levels of legal advice (indeed in most cases they would not have any) will be giving the notice. " 
 
The Court went on to say that the powers of the Tribunal " extend to enabling a consideration of the claim better explaining, or better justifying, a claim in respect of an injury in respect of which notice had been fairly given. " [17]

<sentence id="cs23" from="[2007] FCA 1132">14 The Tribunal thought the matter fell squarely within "the principles set out by the Federal Court in the Abrahams decision. " This was a reference to a decision in Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2007) 93 ALD 147. In Abrahams , I said, at [18]:
 
 
 1. In construing a document purporting to be a notice of injury under the Act, a broad, generous and practical interpretation should be made, consistent with both the beneficial purposes of the Act and the likelihood that laypeople of differing levels of education, differing levels of medical advice and differing levels of legal advice (indeed in most cases they would not have any) will be giving the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2007] AATA 1198">In construing a notice of injury "a broad, generous and practical interpretation should be made......." Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 para.18. This statement of principle is equally applicable to the interpretation of a claim for compensation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2007] AATA 1170">In construing a claim for compensation "a broad, generous and practical interpretation should be made......." Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829. Here it is abundantly clear that the claim for compensation for permanent injury was not limited to the accepted condition on carpal tunnel syndrome but included paraesthesia in both arms, 'frequent severe headaches" and a psychiatric component. Even if Comcare was initially in doubt as to the scope of the claim, that doubt could not have continued after Ms Newton-Edwards requested a review of the initial determination. The letter from her solicitors clearly set out the extent of her claim. Finally it is to be noted that the Review Officer considered and rejected the claim for compensation in relation to the psychiatric condition. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2007] AATA 80">In Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 at paragraph 18 the Court said: 
 
 "There is not always a bright dividing line available to assist in the decision whether powers of the kinds mentioned are being exercised in aid of a better understanding of a claim made in respect of an injury of which notice has been given, or whether the changed notice is sufficiently fundamental as to indicate that a different injury is being asserted, which will require a different decision from a decision in respect of the originally claimed injury under consideration. In determining that matter, considerations of the purpose of giving notice of injury, and more generally of enabling the decision-maker to have a fair opportunity to investigate the claim properly, are paramount. " 
 

On the facts before us we are satisfied that by providing the information she did before the reviewable decision was made, Ms Kose gave the reconsideration officer clear notice of her claim as it was then being made, and in so doing gave Comcare a fair opportunity to consider the claim properly.
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2007] AATA 71">Although the Federal Court was dealing with the rejection of a claim under section 14 of the Act rather than a refusal of ongoing liability to make payments, the principles stated by the Court in Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 are applicable in determining the question under consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2007] AATA 72">It follows that the injuries Mr Streatfield described in his e-mail, which formed part of Ms Worthy's claim on his behalf, were properly before the original decision maker for determination. It is perhaps not surprising that the original decision maker proceeded in the way she did as it is quite plain that Ms Worthy was proceeding on the basis of that the claim would be assessed under Mr Streatfield's previously accepted claim and the symptoms described therein were manifestations of his previously accepted injury. However, the original decision maker was not so bound [13] . The symptoms Mr Streatfield described, and Ms Worthy claimed on his behalf, were asserted to be causally related to his employment. Whether the claimed injuries were manifestations of Mr Streatfield's prior injury or whether they were the direct result of employment activities is a matter to be determined on examination and assessment of the claim. A claim should be beneficially, broadly and practically interpreted [14] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2007] AATA 1025">I am mindful also of the submissions made with regard to Canute v Comcare [2006] HCA 47 ; (2006) 91 ALD 552 and Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 and am accordingly able to consider the claim for headaches in the context of other claimed permanent impairments as made by Ms Lynch. </sentence>
