<citphrase id="cp13.11" type=cited from="[1981] FCA 9">that, as to the interest payments, the taxpayer's expenditure was not primarily incurred to produce assessable income, but was private or domestic. the expenditure should be apportioned (ronpibon tin n.l. v. federal commissioner of taxation [1949] hca 15 ; (1949), 78 clr 47 , applied) and only $660 allowed as a deduction under s. 51 (1) of the income tax assessment act 1936 . as to the valuation and legal expenses, a deduction was available under s. 67 of the act of the proportions there set out. section 67 refers only to borrowing by the taxpayer, not the use of the money by other persons. as to the guarantee fees (by majority, brennan j. dissenting) these were also a borrowing expense and under s. 67 a portion was deductible as there set out.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSC 132">12 Identifying the individual interests of a company in a group of companies raises potentially troubled and problematic questions. [3] It may be accepted that in a group context each company is a separate and independent legal entity and that it is the duty of directors in such a case to consult the interests of each company and of its interests alone in deciding whether payment should be made to other companies. [4] In doing so, however, it will often be necessary to have regard to the fact that the interest of the individual company in question will be so intertwined with the interests of other members of the group that those interests cannot be ignored as part of the interests of the individual company and may need to be taken into consideration.
