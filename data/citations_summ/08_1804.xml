<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1040">Until Jessup J's decision in Williams [2009] FCA 223 , Mr Mates had not been found to have contravened s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act or any other industrial legislation. The applicant referred to Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1804 ; (2008) 178 IR 47 , in which, on 28 November 2008, Marshall J found that, in October 2005, the Union had contravened s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act . Although the report of the case indicates that Mr Mates was involved in the events resulting in the contravention finding against the Union, there was no finding of contravention against Mr Mates. Further, for present purposes, I accept that s 38 involves consideration of facts of a different kind to that involved in a s 43 contravention. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 299">On 28 November 2008, the Court published its reasons for judgment on liability issues in this proceeding. In that judgment the Court found that the respondent Union contravened s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) ("the Act"). This judgment deals with the question of the penalty, if any, which should be imposed on the Union for that contravention. These reasons should be read together with the reasons for judgment in the substantive matter ( Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1804). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 52">Mr Cahill did not plead that stopping the crane on 21 February 2006 was in and of itself "building industrial action": contrast Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union [2008] FCA 1804 at [23] . Nor did he argue to this effect in final submissions, although, for forensic reasons, counsel for the Union and Mr Mates sought to dissect each element of the s 38 case pleaded against them in this way and, in [126] of his closing submissions, Mr Cahill sought declarations in terms that, on one view and contrary to the case as pleaded and argued by him, assumed that a finding about each alleged event (stopping the crane, discouraging crane operators and organising a picket line) had been sought and was therefore open to be made. </sentence>
