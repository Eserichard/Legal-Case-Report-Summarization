<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 650">The underlying rationale of every exercise of the contempt power is that it is necessary to uphold and protect the effective administration of justice: see Mudginberri Station at 107 (per Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ) . The power to punish contempts serves the purpose of disciplining the defendant and vindicating the authority of the court (see Mudginberri Station at 112-113); it is the means by which the law vindicates the public interest in the due administration of justice: see Attorney-General v Times Newspaper Ltd [1974] AC 273 at 315-316; Borrie &amp; Lowe, The Law of Contempt , (3 rd ed, Butterworths, 1996) p 1 and is the way in which the Court preserves respect for its role and the rule of law: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hughes [2001] FCA 38 ; (2001) ATPR 41-807 per Tamberlin J. There are many facets to the administration of justice (Borrie &amp; Lowe, p 1). While the effect of the contempt on the ability to prosecute the principal proceeding may be relevant in assessing the effect of the contempt on the administration of justice: see, for example, Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Morrison Country Clothing Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1965 , the subject matter of the principal proceeding does not define the scope or the effect of the contempt on the administration of justice. In Attorney-General v Times Newspaper Ltd [1974] AC 273 at 309 Lord Diplock considered the requirements of the due administration of justice: 
 "The due administration of justice requires first that all citizens should have unhindered access to the constitutionally established courts of criminal or civil jurisdiction for the determination of disputes as to their legal rights and liabilities; secondly, that they should be able to rely upon obtaining in the courts the arbitrament of a tribunal which is free from bias against any party and whose decision will be based upon those facts only that have been proved in evidence adduced before it in accordance with the procedure adopted in courts of law; and thirdly that, once the dispute has been submitted to a court of law, they should be able to rely upon there being no usurpation by any other person of the function of that court to decide it according to law. Conduct which is calculated to prejudice any of these three requirements or to undermine the public confidence that they will be observed is contempt of court. " 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 194">The CFMEU submitted that the present proceeding, in which allegations of contempt of court were made, was a separate and distinct proceeding which was not comprehended by the terms of s 71 of the BCII Act. Reliance was placed on the decision of the Full Court in the National Union of Workers v Davids Distribution Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1109 ; (1999) 91 FCR 513 where the Court (at 522) quoted with approval the statement of Lehane J, in Real Tech Systems Integration Pty Ltd v Meuross (1998) 82 FCR 150 at 151 that "a proceeding in which contempt is charged, though commenced by motion in an existing proceeding, is nevertheless dealt with in a proceeding which is to be regarded as separate and distinct from the existing proceeding. " Reference was also made to my decision in Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Morrison Country Clothing Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1965. </sentence>
