In Australian and International Pilots Association v Ltd (No.3) [2007] FCA 879 where Tracey J said: "36. In dealing with an application for costs under s 347(1) of the Act, in Standish v University of Tasmania [1989] FCA 166 ; (1989) 28 IR 129 , Lockhart J was called on to decide whether the proceeding had been instituted "without reasonable cause". His Honour drew a distinction between the pursuit of an argument which does not succeed and the institution of a proceeding which is misconceived in the sense of being incompetent: see at 138---9. This distinction may, in my view, assist in determining whether conduct is unreasonable for the purposes of s 824(2). The prosecution of any incompetent or hopeless case can be regarded as "an unreasonable act" within the meaning of s 824(2). Conversely, in my opinion, the pursuit of a contentious, and ultimately unsuccessful, argument is not an unreasonable act.

The pursuit of a contentious, and ultimately unsuccessful, argument is not an unreasonable act Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 879 at [36] . 11. The Court cannot be satisfied that the relevant provisions of s570 have been made out and the Court should make no order for costs. Whilst the respondent referred to the decision in Bahonko v Sterjov [2008] FCAFC 30 what went on in this proceeding in no way approximates the conduct sanctioned in that matter. Indeed, in considering the submissions made on behalf of the respondent that the applicant caused the respondent to incur costs, there is some force in the submissions made on behalf of the applicant that: "9. In relation to any suggestion that Mr Cugera should not have pursued his application in the face of the Respondent's case that s.725 applied to prevent his application, Mr Cugera had a reasonable argument that he had withdrawn his VEOHRC application. As was said by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Clarke [2008] FCAFC 143 at [29] : "There is a distinction between a party who pursues arguments which are ultimately...rejected by the Court and a party who commences a proceeding which is misconceived in the sense of being incompetent or unstoppable..." 10. The distinction between the pursuit of an argument which does not succeed and the institution of a proceeding which is misconceived in the sense of being incompetent may assist in determining whether an act is unreasonable. The pursuit of a contentious, and ultimately unsuccessful, argument is not an unreasonable act Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 879 at [36] .

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 79">As Lucev FM pointed out in Rentuza at [26] --- [28] and Hughes at [19] --- [21]: For the purposes of s.570(2)(b) two criteria must be fulfilled. They are: a. that a party must have engaged in an unreasonable act or omission; and b. that the unreasonable act or omission must have caused another party to incur costs in connection with the proceeding (Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Clarke (2008) 170 FCR 574 ; 176 IR 245 at [28] per Tamberlin, Gyles and Gilmour JJ ( Clarke ). Whether a party has engaged in an unreasonable act or omission depends upon an objective analysis of the particular circumstances of the case (Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 879 ; (2007) 162 FCR 392 ; 165 IR 464 at [32] per Tracey J ( Qantas (No 3) ); McAleer v University of Western Australia ( No 2 ) [2007] FCA 247 ; (2007) 161 IR 151. The exercise of the discretion in s 570(2)(b) is not necessarily engaged because: a) a party does not conduct litigation efficiently (Clarke at [29] per Tamberlin, Gyles and Gilmour JJ); b) a concession is made late (Clarke at [29] per Tamberlin, Gyles and Gilmour JJ); c) a party may have acted in a different or timelier fashion (Clarke at [30] per Tamberlin, Gyles and Gilmour JJ); d) a party has adopted a genuine but misguided approach (See, for example, the approach in Qantas (No 3) at [39] per Tracey J).  On the limited submissions of the parties it has not been established that s.570(1) of the Fair Work Act does not apply to claims in an interlocutory application based on the accrued or associated jurisdiction of the court where the substantive proceedings involve the exercise of jurisdiction under the Fair Work Act . These are proceedings in which an order is sought that one party to proceedings in which the court is exercising jurisdiction under the Fair Work Act pay costs incurred by another party. Were it not for the Fair Work Act jurisdiction, the Court would have no accrued or associated jurisdiction in relation to the matters the subject of the interlocutory application (see Philip Morris Incorporated and Another v Adam P. Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited (1981) 148 CLR 457 ; [1981] HCA 7). Such an approach to the costs of interlocutory applications is consistent with the approach taken to the predecessors to s.570(1) (see in particular Commonwealth of Australia v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2003) 129 FCR 271 ; [2003] FCAFC 115 at [11] and Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 3) (2007) 162 FCR 392 ; [2007] FCA 879 at [14] ) and also with the wide approach to s.570(1) of the FWA taken in Hughes and Rentuza . It was not suggested that these decisions were clearly wrong and should not be followed. </sentence>

In Australia and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 879 , Tracey J said at paragraph 16: ...the common law rule that statutory provisions dealing with the power to award costs are procedural in nature and, in the absence of contrary legislative intention, will operate retrospectively at least to the extent of applying to cases commenced before the amendment: see eg Galvin v Forests Commission of Victoria [1939] VR 284 at 297-8; Jackman v Dandenong Sewerage Authority (No 2) (1967) 20 LGRA 413 at 415.  In support of his submissions, Mr Gouliaditis relied on the cases of: Woodcrest Homes Pty Ltd v Fair Trading Tribunal [2002] NSWSC 552 ; Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 879 ; 162 at 392; Maurici v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue (No 8) [2007] NSWLEC 37 ; Sykes v Queensland Gas Co &amp; Anor [2009] QCA 163 ; and Jackman v Dandenong Sewerage Authority (No 2) (1967) 20 LGRA 413. </sentence>

Respondent
 
 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 These reasons for decision concern an application for costs arising from proceedings which Sally Dennington, a workplace inspector ("the applicant"), commenced in 2007. In those proceedings, the applicant sought inter alia penalties against Pee Cee Pty Ltd ("the respondent") for breaches of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 ("the WR Act").  In Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 879 Tracey J said in relation to the section of the WR Act presently under consideration: "28. Section 824(2) is cast more widely. It applies if a party "has, by an unreasonable act or omission, caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs ...". A party may potentially be liable to pay costs under this sub-section even if it did not institute the proceeding in which the relevant conduct occurred. That conduct may be an act or an omission. The liability may arise, as Young J noted in Paras (at 538 [16]), "irrespective of the outcome of the particular application in question and of the proceeding as a whole. " </sentence>
