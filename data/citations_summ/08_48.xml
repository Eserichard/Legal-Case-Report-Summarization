<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 388">Before leaving this aspect of the matter, it is relevant to consider the tax jurisdiction of the Court where the relevant document is an "Appeal Statement". An "Appeal Statement" is defined in the FCR to be a statement "outlining succinctly the Commissioner's contentions and the facts and issues in the appeal as the Commissioner perceives them": O 52B r 5(3) of the FCR. They take the place of pleadings, but they are not, in substance, pleadings: WR Carpenter at [35]; McDonald's Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2008] FCA 395 ; (2008) 69 ATR 898 at [6] ; see also Pacific Exchange Corporation Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1155 ; (2009) 180 FCR 300 at [3] (cf Rio Tinto Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 335 ; (2004) 55 ATR 321 at [22] --- [27] and [58]). Their stated purpose is different --- to give each party and the Court a practical understanding of the parties' positions and summarise the essential issues on appeal: BAE Systems Australia (NSW) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation for the Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 48 ; (2008) 69 ATR 567 at [19] . Further, they are not subject to the same scrutiny as a pleading: BAE at [19]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1155">It has been observed in prior authority that the purpose of the appeal statement is one of informing a taxpayer of the Commissioner's view, at that time, of the bases of the Commissioner's rejection of an assessment objection. In this regard, it has been said that its purpose is a practical one: see BAE Systems Australia (New South Wales) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 48 ; (2008) 69 ATR 567. It has also been observed that the appeal statement is not a pleading: McDonald's Australia Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2008] FCA 395 ; (2008) 69 ATR 898. So much may be accepted. It is nonetheless a feature of an appeal statement that it forms part of an obligation which the Court has to afford the parties to a proceeding procedural fairness. One of the ways in which that particular obligation is fulfilled is by ensuring that a party to a proceeding knows the case it has to meet. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 395">6 Before the primary judge, McDonald's relied, for its contention that a defence to its applications was bound to fail, upon the contents of appeal statements filed by the respondent Commissioner pursuant to O 52B r 5 of the Federal Court Rules . The requirement imposed by that rule is to file a statement which is described by O 52B r 5(3) as 'a statement outlining succinctly the Commissioner's contentions and the facts and issues in the appeal as the Commissioner perceives them' . An appeal statement is not a pleading (see the definition of 'pleading' in O 1 r 4; see also WR Carpenter Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [2006] FCA 1252 ; (2006) 234 ALR 451). Even if it was, it would not be sufficient to rely simply upon pleading points to satisfy s 31A where there was any prospect that leave might be granted to state a respectable basis for defending proceedings (see also Rio Tinto Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [2004] FCA 335 ; (2004) 55 ATR 321 ; BAE Systems Australia (NSW) Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation for the Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 48). </sentence>
