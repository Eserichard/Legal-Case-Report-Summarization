<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 418">Before considering that question, I should say something of the authorities to which I was referred by senior counsel for the ACCC in support of the conclusion I have reached as to such contraventions. In particular, I was referred to the 'dual pricing' arrangements involving 'was' and 'now' prices and 'strike through' and 'sale' prices in catalogues issued by retail jewellers in Ascot Four Pty Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2009] FCAFC 61 ; (2009) 176 FCR 106 and Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 75 ; [2008] ATPR 42-217 (first instance); 42-268 (on appeal). Senior counsel for StoresOnline submitted that the facts of this case were clearly distinguishable from the facts of those cases. He submitted that each of the catalogues at issue in those cases contained offers explicitly limited in time and the retailer's purpose in each case, clearly enough, was to increase sales by creating the impression that the discount offered would be available for a limited time only, after which the 'now' price would cease to be on offer, and the price payable by the customer for the relevant item would revert to the 'was' price. There were findings in each of those cases that none of the relevant items of jewellery had genuinely been on offer for any period of time at the 'was' price. For that reason, he submitted, the representation embodied by the 'strike through' price was held to be misleading: see Prouds Jewellers at [42] and Ascot Four at [32]. He submitted that there was no proper basis for making such findings in this case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 903">The ACCC submitted they were likely to be sufficiently gullible or vulnerable to fail to understand (either wholly or partially) the message conveyed in the advertisements including the message about the cost and nature of the service. Teracomm submitted they were savvy, technologically literate adolescents who would have well understood the advertisements. It is sufficient, when dealing with this question, to repeat (without using quotations) what I said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 75 at [16] and [19]. The leading authority on the question of how the audience is identified and what characteristics or attributes it may have, is the judgment of the High Court in Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45: see also Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd [2009] HCA 25 at [26] . In considering the nexus between the conduct and the likely misleading or deception of the prospective purchasers in the case of representations to the public it is necessary to isolate who are the "ordinary" or "reasonable" members of the class of prospective purchasers.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 682"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 590"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCAFC 61">30 The different result from that in Prouds Jewellers is explained by the different allegations and evidence before the Court in the present case. As noted, the ACCC failed on the relevant aspect of the claim in Prouds Jewellers because it pleaded that the representation was the saving between the sale price and the amount actually paid by consumers before the sale period. The present case is different. The ACCC's allegation in the present case depended on the strike through price representing the price that would have been paid before the sale period. This allegation does not depend on purchasers being imputed with knowledge of actual sales prices. The primary judge's characterisation of the representation was consistent with Moore J's approach to that issue. This is because the latter half of the representation as found by Moore J at [37] ("and thus the price at which they would then have been bought"), on the facts of the present case, was false. In other words, it was open to Moore J in Prouds Jewellers 75 IPR 306 ; [2008] FCA 75 to find that on the facts, the possibility could not be excluded that the consumer unaware of the potential for obtaining a discount would in fact have paid the ticketed price. In this case, however, where for whatever reason there were no recorded sales at or near the strike through price, it is simply implausible that any customer, no matter how ill-informed about bargaining opportunities, would have paid that price. 25 The present case involves different facts. In contrast to Prouds Jewellers , the strike through price was in fact the ticketed price (or offer price) for the items the subject of counts 2 to 11 before the sale period. In this context, the primary judge found that the sale catalogue conveyed a representation that purchasers of the 11 items during the sale period would make a saving of the difference between the sale price and the strike through price. However, there had never been a sale of any item at or approaching the strike through price before the sale period. It may be accepted that the primary judge's characterisation of the representation does not contain an express finding about the meaning of the strike through price. But when the reasons are read as a whole it is clear that the primary judge considered that the strike through price meant the price at which the items had been offered for sale and which the relevant consumer of the items would have paid before the sale (in the same sense as explained by Moore J in Prouds Jewellers 75 IPR 306 ; [2008] FCA 75 , namely, the price the consumer would have expected to pay before the sale). This is apparent from the primary judge's focus, in his description (at [100]) of the representation, upon the saving to be made by the consumer him or herself.  17 Ascot Four placed substantial weight on the decisions in Prouds Jewellers to support its case that the primary judge had erred. In Prouds Jewellers 75 IPR 306 ; [2008] FCA 75 , Moore J (at [37]) considered the position of a consumer unaware of the availability of discounts from the ticketed or marked price of jewellery items when confronted by advertising involving dual pricing (that is, a strike through or "was" price and a sale or "now" price):
 I accept that this hypothetical consumer would, when seeing a "was" price in juxtaposition with a "now" price in relation to an item of jewellery which the consumer might be interested in purchasing, contemplate what savings he or she might achieve if the item was purchased during the sale. However, I doubt that such a hypothetical consumer would have viewed the "was" price as either a bare sale or a bare offer price as a matter of characterisation. Rather, it is probable, in my opinion, that the hypothetical consumer would have seen the two prices (the "was" and the "now" price) in juxtaposition and, in the context of considering what savings might be achieved, would have understood that before the sale to which the catalogue related, he or she would have bought the item for the "was" price had it been purchased then. But now, during the sale period, he or she would be able to buy the item at the "now" price. The difference between those two prices would be seen by the hypothetical consumer as the savings that would be achieved by him or her by purchasing an item during the sale period. The focus of the hypothetical consumer's consideration of the pricing in the catalogue would, in the context of savings to be made, be on the benefits flowing to him or her by the sale to which the catalogue was directed. Implicit in this analysis is that the "was" price was the price at which the goods were being offered for sale in the period before the promotional sale and thus the price at which they would then have been bought.  3 By its notice of appeal Ascot Four claimed that the primary judge had erred, in that the primary judge should have found that: - (i) both the strike through price and sale price represented an offer price only (alleged to be consistent with the approach in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd (2008) 75 IPR 306 ; [2008] FCA 75 , upheld by the Full Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 199) , (ii) Ascot Four had offered the 11 items of jewellery for sale at the strike through price before the advertisement of the sale price, and (iii) accordingly, Ascot Four had not contravened s 75AZC(1)(g) of the Trade Practices Act with respect to the 11 items of jewellery.
  23 Given that the representation conveyed by the sales catalogues relates to the sale period, Moore J's findings in Prouds Jewellers 75 IPR 306 ; [2008] FCA 75 about the time before the sale period can only be understood as findings about what a potential purchaser would think would have been paid had he or she purchased the item before the sale period. In other words, the strike through price did not indicate the actual sale price but a prospective purchaser's expectation of the price he or she would have paid. This difference between the representation Moore J found and that pleaded by the ACCC led to the dismissal of the ACCC's allegations.  14 Ascot Four observed that in Prouds Jewellers , being a case on similar facts, Moore J and the Full Court had ascribed to a hypothetical consumer, who was unaware of the discount culture in the retail jewellery industry, a willingness to purchase an item at the ticketed or offer price without negotiation for a reduction to that price ((2008) 75 IPR 306 ; [2008] FCA 75 at [18] and [2008] FCAFC 199 at [31] ). Contrary to the primary judge's conclusion, said Ascot Four, consumers both aware and unaware of the discount culture in this retail market would treat the sale price as well as the strike through price as an offer price (and not a price at which the items had actually been sold) for the following reasons:
 
(i) The relevant analysis is at the time of a proposed purchase. The meaning of the representation cannot be determined by reference to actual sale prices which would not have been known to consumers. (iv) A consumer unaware of the discount culture would have treated the strike through price as the price at which that consumer would have bought the item before the sale. Because this type of consumer would not have sought or obtained any discount, the price at which he or she would have bought the item would also be treated as the offer price before the sale period. This approach is consistent with the conclusions of Moore J in Prouds Jewellers 75 IPR 306 ; [2008] FCA 75 at [38] and [39]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 476">6 This leads to a question of how the declaratory orders should be expressed. Prouds seeks a declaration, in its proposed order 1, that certain conduct was not misleading or deceptive. Prouds' proposed order 1 simply reflects conclusions I reached and expressed in my reasons for judgment (see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 75) and, in my opinion, nothing more. It is clear, however, that declaratory orders should not be used for this purpose. As the Full Court said in Warramunda Village Inc v Pryde [2001] FCA 61 ; (2001) 105 FCR 437 at [8] :
 
 The remedy of a declaration of right is ordinarily granted as final relief in a proceeding.</sentence>
