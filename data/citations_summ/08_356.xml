<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 360">The final ground relied on by the applicant was: "I was deprived of natural justice because the Tribunal erred in laws due to its prejudice and bias against me. " 
Insofar as his claim refers to bias, it is a matter that only in rare and extreme circumstances can be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal; SZHVL v The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356 as McKerracher J said (at [17]) in that case:
 
 "It is clear that an allegation of bias must be distinctly made and proven: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [69] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J. It would be a rare and extreme circumstance that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal: SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 at [38] per von Doussa J. " 

The applicant in the instant case has provided no particulars of the alleged bias and it is certainly not evident or even hinted at in the Tribunal's reasons for decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 84">The applicant accepts that it would only be a very rare and extreme circumstance whereby bias on the part of the Tribunal could be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal; SZHDL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 356 , however he advances that claim in this case. The test for apprehended bias in the case of an administrative proceeding was articulated by Branson J in Ling v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2004] FCA 1069 echoing the decision of the High Court in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; [2001] 75 ALJR 982 at [28] . Her Honour said: "The appropriate test to be applied in determining whether the conduct of the Tribunal gave rise to an apprehension of bias is that identified by the High Court in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex Parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; 75 (2001) ALJR 982 at [28] . That test is whether a hypothetical fair-minded lay person, who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to have given rise to an apprehension of bias, might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided. " 
The High Court itself affirmed the test in Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor v SZJSS [2010] HCA 48 at [42] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 121">And in SZHVL v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 356 McKerracher J said at [17]: "It is clear that an allegation of bias must be distinctly made and proven: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [69] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J: It would be a rare and extreme circumstance that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal : SCAA v Minister for Immigration [2002] FCA 668 at [38] per von Doussa J. " 
As has been said, disagreement with, even violent disagreement with the views expressed by a Tribunal does not constitute jurisdictional error. In this particular case, the inconsistencies pointed out by the Tribunal existed. The Tribunal was charged with determining whether or not it should accept the explanations given by the applicant and determined not to. In those circumstances, its findings were based upon available evidence and do not reveal jurisdictional error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 937">As the solicitor for the first respondent pointed out, if the applicant intended to claim that persons in circumstances similar to hers (where the Tribunal had found that such persons were not Falun Gong practitioners in China and that the only purpose of Falun Gong activities in Australia was to strengthen claims) had been granted protection visas there is no basis for any such contention. It seems more likely the applicant meant that persons with similar claims to her had been found by the Tribunal to be persons to whom Australia had protection obligations under the Refugees Convention. However such an assertion does not establish jurisdictional error. It is for the Tribunal to make findings of fact in relation to the claims of the particular applicant before it. In this case the applicant's claims were rejected on the basis of all of her evidence. The findings made by the Tribunal were open for the reasons which it gave, notwithstanding that it may be intended to assert that a different decision-maker might have reached a different conclusion on those facts. Again, I note that there is nothing in the material before the court to support any claim of actual or apprehended bias. Any such allegation must be " distinctly made and clearly proved " ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 ; [2001] HCA 17 at [69] and [127]). It is rare that it would be established on the Tribunal record of decision alone and there is nothing in the Tribunal's reasons for decision to support such a contention (see SCAA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 and SZHVL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 720">Actual bias is a serious allegation that must be clearly particularised. It is only a rare and exceptional case in which actual bias will be established from the Tribunal reasons for decision alone (see SCAA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 and SZHVL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356). There is nothing in the Tribunal reasons for decision and its summary of the hearing to establish an allegation of actual bias. The fact that the Tribunal had concerns and drew those to the applicant's attention during the hearing is not indicative of actual bias. Its decision was open to it on the material before it for the reasons which it gave. These claims are not made out. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 595">The final ground was: "3. The Tribunal's decision has included a reasonable apprehension of bias; 
Particulars
 
The Tribunal's decision was infected with jurisdictional error in that the reasoning process employed by the Tribunal in reaching its decision reveals irrationality, illogicality and/or unreasonableness. "
 
Regrettably, the Court was not told what extracts from the Tribunal decision are irrational. There are no hints as to what might constitute illogicality and no indications of where unreasonableness might be found. Without these, and bearing in mind that McKerracher J said in SZHVL v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 356 at [17] that:
 
 "It would be a rare and extreme circumstance that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal: SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 at [38] per von Doussa J. See also SBBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 358 at [16] per Tamberlin, Mansfield and Jacobson JJ. " 

I would have to reject this ground as well. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 487">The applicant has provided no evidence of the bias that he alleges. In SZHVL v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 356 , McKerracher J said [17]: "It would be a rare and extreme circumstance that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal: SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 at [38] per von Doussa J. See also SBBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 358 at [16] per Tamberlin, Mansfield and Jacobson JJ. 
These authorities make it clear that I am unable to assist the applicant in his claim of bias without some better evidence. "
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FMCA 336">Nor is there anything in the material before the court indicative of either actual or apprehended bias. It is a rare case in which actual bias will be established on the basis of the Tribunal reasons alone (see SCAA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 , SZHVL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356). This is not such a case. Rather, the decision record reveals that the Tribunal was aware of the law to be applied, considered the applicant's written and oral claims, gave him an opportunity to elaborate on his claims and to address its concerns, considered independent country information and assessed the applicant's claims in view of the applicable law and on the evidence before it. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FMCA 181">In relation to the claim of bias, it is well established that it is only in a " rare and extreme circumstance that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal " (see SZHVL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356 at [17] and cases cited therein). This is not such a case. The fact that the Tribunal proceeded as it did, its statement that it had " done its best to distil the applicant's claims from the materials, information and submissions " and the fact that it found much of the applicant's material to be " confused in its sense ", " difficult to understand " and " unclear " is not indicative of actual bias in the sense considered in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 ; [2001] HCA 17 or apprehended bias in the sense considered in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H (2001) 75 ALJR 982 ; [2001] HCA 28. As Sundberg J pointed out in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v MZXPA and Another (2008) 100 ALD 312 ; [2008] FCA 185 at [13] , the hypothetical fair-minded and informed person from whose perspective an apprehension of bias is assessed: ... would be aware of the nature of the Tribunal's review functions and proceedings, and that the Tribunal would not invite an applicant to a hearing unless, on the material available to it, it had already reached a preliminary view unfavourable to the applicant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] FMCA 139">It is well-established that it is only in a rare and extreme circumstance that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the Tribunal reasons for decision. See SZHVL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356. There is no transcript of the hearing before the court in this instance. The material before the court is not such as to support the applicant's claims of bias, whether actual bias in the sense considered in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 ; [2001] HCA 17 or apprehended bias in the sense considered in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H (2001) 75 ALJR 982 ; [2001] HCA 28. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] FMCA 78">The third ground is that the Tribunal's decision gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Such a generally expressed claim is not made out. It is only in rare and extreme circumstances that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the Tribunal's reasons for decision (see SZHVL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356). As discussed further below, neither apprehended bias in the sense considered in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H (2001) 75 ALJR 982 ; [2001] HCA 28 , or actual bias in the sense considered in the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 ; [2001] HCA 17 , is made out on the material before the court. In particular, no partiality or perception of bias or a closed mind is established on the part of the Tribunal member on the basis of the decision record from the perspective of the appropriately informed reasonable lay observer. Rather it appears from the Tribunal's reasons for decision that the Tribunal embarked on a thorough examination of the applicant's claims, which properly involved testing those claims at the hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FMCA 1063">Neither actual nor apprehended bias is established in the manner contended for by the applicant. There is nothing in the material before the court to establish that the Tribunal was biased in the sense considered in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 ; [2001] HCA 17. Actual bias is not easily proved and, as stated in SZHVL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356 , it would only be in a rare and extreme circumstance that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal. In this case there is, in addition, the timing of the various events relied on by the applicant but this is not such as to establish either actual bias or apprehended bias considered from the perspective of the appropriately informed lay observer in the sense considered in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H (2001) 75 ALJR 982; [2001] HCA 28. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FMCA 1108">I note that it is only in a rare and exceptional circumstance that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the reasons for decision (see SZHVL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356) , and on the material before the court, the fact that the Tribunal raised with the applicant at the commencement of the hearing the general issue of her credibility and thereafter particular concerns about the credibility of aspects of her claims is not such as to establish either actual bias in the sense of predetermination or, from the perspective of the appropriately informed lay observer, that the decision-maker might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to resolution of the issue before it. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FMCA 1088">In regard to the claim of bias, the applicant provides the court with no particulars. He seems to be saying that because the Tribunal did not believe either himself or his witnesses, it must be biased. In SZHVL v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 356 McKerracher J said at 17: "It is clear that an allegation of bias must be distinctly made and proven: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legend (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [69] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J. It would be a rare and extreme circumstance that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal: SCAA v Minister for Immigration [2002] FCA 668 at [38] per von Doussa J. 
In Minister for Immigration v MZXPA [2008] FCA 185 Sundberg J said at [14]:
 
 "An informed and instructed hypothetical person would also know that the Tribunal is an inquisitorial body, and is not required uncritically to accept an applicant's claims: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 596.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FMCA 984">When one considers the Tribunal reasons for decision this is not a case in which it has been established that the Tribunal's fact finding was conducted in such a manner as to lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias in the sense considered by Allsop J in NADH of 2001 and Others v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 214 ALR 264 ; [2004] FCAFC 328. The fact that the Tribunal did not accept the applicant's claim that he was a Falun Gong practitioner is not such as to establish either actual or apprehended bias. I note in that respect that only in a rare and exceptional case would bias on the part of the Tribunal be established simply by reference to the Tribunal reasons for decision (see SZHVL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FMCA 927">Finally, the applicant made a late plea that the Tribunal should have telephoned the witnesses whose evidence it was not prepared to accept. This is a claim that the Tribunal should have made inquiries but it does not pass the test set out in Minister for Immigration v Lee [2007] FCA 138 , which would only make this an obligation where the information is on a critical issue and is readily available and centrally relevant. Otherwise, there is no general duty to inquire; SZHVL v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 356 ; Seyfarth v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCA 1713 , MIMIA v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] FMCA 789">The applicant also claimed that there was a denial of natural justice and apprehended bias. There is nothing in the material before the Court to establish actual or apprehended bias either arising from the Tribunal's account of the manner in which it conducted the hearing or from the Tribunal reasons for decision. Insofar as the applicant relies on the Tribunal reasons for decision, it would only be in rare and extreme circumstances that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal (see SZHVL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356). This is not a case in which it can be said that the fact finding was conducted in a manner which could give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias as considered in NADH of 2001 and Others v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264. </sentence>

This is not such a case. The fact that the Tribunal considered itself bound to make the decision that it did on the basis of the opinion of the RMOC, is not evidence of bias or such as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. It did not simply accept the opinion. It considered whether the RMOC applied the wrong test. </sentence>

In so far as the applicant's disagreement with the Tribunal's findings seeks merits review, merits review is not available in this Court. This ground is not made out. Issues arising out of the conduct of the Tribunal hearing are discussed below. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2008] FMCA 1691">In SZHVL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 356 McKerracher J says at [17], "As to the allegations of bias in the written submissions, I would not permit this matter to be raised on the appeal. It was not argued in the application for review by the Federal Magistrates Court nor was it included as a ground of appeal in the appeal to this Court. It is clear that an allegation of bias must be distinctly made and proven: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [69] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J. It would be a rare and extreme circumstance that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal: SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 at [38] per von Doussa J. See also SBBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 358 at [16] per Tamberlin, Mansfield and Jacobson JJ. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] FCA 1697">7 The primary judge also correctly dismissed the apprehension of bias allegation. As the primary judge observed: - (i) the evidence does not include a transcript or tape of the proceedings before the Tribunal, (ii) it will be a rare case in which an apprehension of bias can be established by reference only to the Tribunal's reasons for decision (citing SZHVL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356 at [17] ), and (iii) the function of the Tribunal as an inquisitorial body must also be kept in mind (citing Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v MZXPA (2008) 100 ALD 312 ; [2008] FCA 185 at [12] --- [14]). The primary judge thus concluded that the second ground had to be dismissed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] FMCA 1593">I note, as stated in SZHVL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 356 , that only in a rare and extreme circumstance would bias on the part of the Tribunal be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal. It is not made out in this case by those reasons or by the Tribunal proceeding in the manner that it did under s.426A of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2008] FMCA 1408">The applicant appealed, and pursued other arguments before McKerracher J. The appeal was dismissed on 18 March 2007 (see SZHVL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 356). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2008] FMCA 1108">" 
 
In advising the applicant that it was his responsibility to obtain the information, the Tribunal was doing no more than indicating to the applicant that it was his responsibility to advance his own case, a fundamental pillar of the Tribunal system: Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration (2003) 197 ALR 389 at [78]; Applicant S214/2003 v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 166 at [26] . Whilst it is accepted that in certain circumstances, the Tribunal may have a duty to inquire, this is only required where the information relates to a critical issue and is readily available and centrally relevant: Minister for Immigration v Le [2007] FCA 1318 , Prasad v Minister for Immigration [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 65 ALR 549. There is no general duty to inquire: SZHVL v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 356 ; Minister for Immigration v SGLB [2004] 207 ALR 12 ; Seyfarth v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCA 1713. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2008] FMCA 1092">The applicant filed a written submission with this court on 8 July 2008. It follows the amended application and does not, to my mind, need further comment. Before me today the applicant said that the Tribunal did not take any action to verify his claims from Pakistan. I think what the applicant meant was that the Tribunal had not conducted its own inquiries. As the applicant has not explained what information it was that the Tribunal might have obtained from Pakistan, it is difficult for me to say that it had failed to obtain information on a critical issue where such information was readily available and centrally relevant: Minister for Immigration v Le [2007] FCA 1318. The fact is there is no general duty to inquire on the part of the Tribunal: SZHVL v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 356 , Seyfarth v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCA 1713 , VCAK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCA 459 ; Minister for Immigration v SGLB [2004] 207 ALR 12. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2008] FMCA 880">The applicant has produced neither a transcript of the hearing nor a tape and the court only has the Tribunal's record to rely on. In SZHVL v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 356 McKerracher J held at 17: 
"It is clear that an allegation of bias must be distinctly made and proven: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [69] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J.
