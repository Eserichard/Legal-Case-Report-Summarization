<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 32">61 There is undoubtedly a distinction between a pleading on the one hand and proofs of evidence and affidavits filed in accordance with a direction given by the Court on the other. Pleadings may be inspected, unless a confidentiality order is in place, by a search of the Registry: see O 46 r 6(1) and (2) of the Federal Court Rules (Cth). On the other hand, affidavits and witness statements filed will not be able to be inspected without the leave of the Court, and this may not occur if the affidavit or witness statement has not been admitted into evidence or otherwise relied upon or referred to: see O 46 r 6(3) and Churche v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (No 3) [2006] FCA 1168 at [26] . We note that, whilst O 46 r 6(3) distinguishes between affidavits (see O 46 r 6(3)(a) and unsworn statements of evidence (see O 46 r 6(3)(b)), no different consequence arises from the fact that there exists affidavits or unsworn statements of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 123">It is, therefore, appropriate to permit access to the affidavits read on the applicant's and respondents' behalf unless there is good reason not to do so: see, eg Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation v Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations [2006] FCA 606. An order under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), or if there was some other legislative provision which directed that certain information be regarded as confidential, would probably displace that starting point: Churche v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (No 3) [2006] FCA 1168. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 783">73 This seems to me to be consistent with the approach taken by Cowdroy J in Churche v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (No 3) [2006] FCA 1168 at [26] . His Honour granted access to affidavits admitted into evidence, but access was otherwise refused. Access was granted to annexures but they form part of the affidavit and are to be distinguished from exhibits in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] WASC 133">43 Order 46 r 6 of the Federal Court Rules was recently considered by Cowdroy J in Churche v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (No 3) [2006] FCA 1168. Cowdroy J considered whether leave should be granted to various media organisations to access parts of the file to which O 46 r 6(3) applies. Cowdroy J referred to the statements of Finkelstein J in ACCC v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd ( supra ) to which I have earlier referred. His Honour referred to the following statement of Sackville J at [27] of Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1394 ; (2005) 148 FCR 1: 
 "[I]t seems to me that unless the interests of justice require otherwise, this court would ordinarily take the view that a non-party should have access to all non-confidential documents and other material admitted into evidence. I say 'ordinarily' because the circumstances of each case will vary and the exercise of the discretion under O 46, r 6 of the Rules will have take into account the particular circumstances of the case. I agree ... that a convenient touchstone for determining the question of access by non-parties is whether the documents or other material have been admitted into evidence. In general, the application of this principle will serve the interests of open justice. In particular, access to the documentary evidence can be expected to be helpful to a person seeking to understand or explain the proceedings, or to evaluate the Court's determination of the issues arising in the proceeding.
