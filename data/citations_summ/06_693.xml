<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 404">There is also authority that an adjournment may be ordered to enable litigation of a claim that a debtor has against a petitioning creditor provided the Court is satisfied that it is a real one. (See for example Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Jeans (No 3) [2006] FCA 693). However, despite some reference in Ms Foxman's affidavits to matters that might emerge from the investigations of the liquidator, it was not claimed that the respondent debtor sought to litigate some other specified claim that she had against the petitioning creditor. Rather Ms Foxman suggested generally that the result of the current enquiries by the liquidator may produce evidence of fraud, which may give rise to some form of legal proceedings. There is also a suggestion in the affidavits of possible misleading and deceptive conduct by certain other persons in relation to the circumstances surrounding the use of Credex dollars and the Credex trading scheme. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] NSWSC 647">21 The bankruptcy proceedings are listed for hearing before Rares J on 5 July 2006. If the bankruptcy petition remains undetermined prior to its expiry on 9 July 2006, the Bank will lose the benefit of any relation-back period based on the occurrence of the act of bankruptcy which founds the petition: Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Jeans [2006] FCA 693 at paragraph 12. I was informed that the sole basis upon which the Plaintiff could resist the bankruptcy petition at the hearing before Rares J would be a judgment in his favour in the present proceedings.</sentence>
