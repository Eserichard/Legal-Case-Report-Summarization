<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 91">In the present circumstances it is considered that it can. In SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 Mansfield, Selway and Bennett JJ observed: " [19] ... If the Tribunal makes a finding and that finding is a critical step in its ultimate conclusion and there is no evidence to support that finding then this may well constitute a jurisdictional error ... " And, in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824[DOC] Greenwood J reviewed some of the authorities (including SFGB [2003] FCAFC 231 ; 77 ALD 402) and concluded: "[31] The central matter is this. [32] A determination of the Tribunal as to a state of satisfaction or otherwise, of the relevant criteria or criterion in question, that is based upon a finding of fact or inferences drawn from facts, not based on logical or rational grounds, will give rise to an error of jurisdiction if there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing the inference; or, if there be some evidence, although inadequate, reliance by the Tribunal upon that inadequate evidence gives rise to an inference that the Tribunal has misconceived the test or is not, in reality, satisfied of the requisite matters, as a result of which there has been only a purported, rather than a real, exercise of the power conferred upon the Tribunal. " Although the circumstances in which such errors as that which the Tribunal committed in the present case may be rare, when they do occur this Court should intervene unless it is satisfied that the error was non-prejudicial. Whether or not the Tribunal's inference from its finding about the late raising of the claim can be said not to be based on logical or rational grounds, there was no evidence to support the finding of a late claim and no proper basis for drawing an inference that the claim was made only to strengthen the application. Nor was there a proper basis for such a perceived omission to be relied on by the Tribunal in support of the adverse credibility finding. Yet these findings were critical steps in the Tribunal's ultimate conclusion (see SFGB and SZDFZ, and also SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 , SZKMX v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 856 and SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2009) 108 ALD 515; [2009] FCA 315 at [51] --- [56]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 360">Reaching findings of fact unsupported by any evidence or improperly drawing inferences from facts found is an error of law on the part of the Tribunal: SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 ; SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi [2001] FCA 744 ; (2001) 65 ALD 141 per Sundberg, Emmett and Finkelstein JJ at [34]. When the Tribunal exercises its jurisdiction, it is required to stand in the shoes of the original decision-maker and examine all of the matters afresh including all evidence put before the Tribunal. It must consider the statutory provisions applicable to the resolution of the questions before it and it must have regard to decisions of the Tribunal on those questions and decisions of the Courts.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 71">I accept that the relevant test is [6] : A determination of the Tribunal as to a state of satisfaction or otherwise, of the relevant criteria or criterion in question, that is based upon a finding of fact or inferences drawn from facts, not based on logical or rational grounds, will give rise to an error of jurisdiction if there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing the inference; or, if there be some evidence, although inadequate, reliance by the Tribunal upon that inadequate evidence gives rise to an inference that the Tribunal has misconceived the test or is not, in reality, satisfied of the requisite matters, as a result of which there has been only a purported, rather than a real, exercise of the power conferred upon the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1295">The applicant also took issue with what might be described as the logic of the Tribunal decision, referring to the fact that just because the Tribunal did not see any reports from Fujian province suggesting that people in her Church were experiencing persecution, this did not mean that persecution was not occurring there. However this contention does not establish jurisdictional error of the kind considered in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 (at [17] --- [30]) or otherwise. The applicant's disagreement with the Tribunal's conclusions in essence seeks merits review. The Tribunal is not required to have rebutting evidence before it to fail to be satisfied of the claims made by an applicant (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 at [17]). </sentence>

Here there is evidence to support the finding of the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 1144">For the reasons given above, it has not been established that there was an error of jurisdiction in the sense considered by Greenwood J in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [32] as follows: A determination of the Tribunal as to a state of satisfaction or otherwise, of the relevant criteria or criterion in question, that is based upon a finding of fact or inferences drawn from facts, not based on logical or rational grounds, will give rise to an error of jurisdiction if there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing the inference; or, if there be some evidence, although inadequate, reliance by the Tribunal upon that inadequate evidence gives rise to an inference that the Tribunal has misconceived the test or is not, in reality, satisfied of the requisite matters, as a result of which there has been only a purported, rather than a real, exercise of the power conferred upon the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 1207">The resolution of the final question involved a finding of fact or findings of facts from which inferences might be drawn as to the ultimate question in issue. If there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing any inference upon which the Tribunal has relied, an error of law arises. As to findings "unsupported by any evidence", see SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 per Mansfield, Selway and Bennett JJ. Want of logic or faulty logic on the part of the Tribunal is not synonymous with error of law. As to inferences that might be drawn, so long as the particular inference is reasonably open even if the inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning, there is no error of law: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi [2001] FCA 744 ; (2001) 65 ALD 141.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 827">Her Honour found that the appellant was unable to establish that the Tribunal's assessment of this evidence was not open to it for the reasons it gave. In particular, it had not been established that the Tribunal made a finding that was a critical step in its ultimate conclusion for which there was no evidence in support in the manner considered in SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 or that there was no evidence in relation to a jurisdictional fact or essential preliminary in the decision-making process (see VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302).

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 528">Fact finding is the province of the tribunal. Ordinarily, an error of fact by the tribunal will not constitute a jurisdictional error, let alone an error of law. There is no error of law in simply making a wrong finding of fact: Enfield City v Development Assessment Commission ; [2000] HCA 5 ; (2000) 199 CLR 135 at 154 [44] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. Mr Toro Martinez accepted that position. However, he argued that the tribunal's conclusion that he would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia was not a finding that the tribunal could make on any fair reading of the totality of the material on which it was based. He relied on the principle that if a decision-maker made a finding that was a critical step in arriving at its ultimate conclusion, but had no evidence to support it, the finding may well constitute a jurisdictional error: SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 at 407 [19] per Mansfield, Selway and Bennett JJ; SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [32] per Greenwood J; SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1 at 12 [42] per Flick J. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 348">Dealing first with the grounds in the application, the first ground asserts that there was no evidence or other materials to justify the making of the decision. However in this case the Tribunal's decision was based on its appraisal of the applicant's claims having regard to the visitor visa application, the protection visa application and her oral evidence to the Tribunal. For the reasons it gave it found that the applicant was lacking credibility. It has not been established that the Tribunal's assessment of this evidence was not open to it for the reasons it gave. In particular, it has not been established that the Tribunal made a finding that was critical step in its ultimate conclusion for which there was no evidence in support in the manner considered in SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 or that there was no evidence in relation to a jurisdictional fact or essential preliminary in the decision-making process (see VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302). Also see more generally the discussion by Greenwood J in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 in relation to the limits of the no evidence ground. As his Honour concluded at [32]: A determination of the Tribunal as to a state of satisfaction or otherwise, of the relevant criteria or criterion in question, that is based upon a finding of fact or inferences drawn from facts, not based on logical or rational grounds, will give rise to an error of jurisdiction if there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing the inference; or, if there be some evidence, although inadequate, reliance by the Tribunal upon that inadequate evidence gives rise to an inference that the Tribunal has misconceived the test or is not, in reality, satisfied of the requisite matters, as a result of which there has been only a purported, rather than a real, exercise of the power conferred upon the Tribunal. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 1685">In support of his contentions the visa applicant particularly relied upon the observations of Greenwood J in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 who noted at [29]: "It therefore seems to me that in exercising judicial review, an examination might properly occur to determine whether the decision making in reaching a state of satisfaction in discharge of the review function and in making his or her determination, displayed, in the s430 reasons, defects of illogical or irrational reasoning upon which the determination rests whether the determination is based on findings or inferences not supported by rational grounds, subject to this. "Inadequacy" in the material is, by itself, not enough (SGLB). Inadequacy may, however, be a circumstance which supports an inference that the Tribunal misconceived the test or was not satisfied in respect of the correct test (s20/222002). ... A determination of the Tribunal as to a state of satisfaction or otherwise, of the relevant criteria or criterion in question, that is based upon a finding of fact or inferences drawn from facts, not based on logical or rational grounds, will give rise to an error of jurisdiction if there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing the inference; or, if there be some evidence, although inadequate, reliance by the Tribunal upon that inadequate evidence gives rise to an inference that the Tribunal has misconceived the test or is not, in reality, satisfied of the requisite matters, as a result of which there has been only a purported, rather than a real, exercise of the power conferred upon the Tribunal. "  In a discursive manner the Tribunal proceeded to examine the basis for that pre-emptive conclusion on credit. That analysis occurred over the following four pages. The critical finding relied upon particularly by the visa applicant is to be found at page 52 of the decision (CB379). However given the opening comments above I do not accept that the Tribunal was intending such a constrictive view as submitted by the visa applicant in support of its contention that the Tribunal's approach was illogical. As was noted by Greenwood J. at [32] of the decision in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824: "...There is no place for judicial review in simply demonstrating "faulty logic" as "want of logic is not synonymous with error of law. So long as the particular inference is reasonably open even if the inference appears to have been drawn as the result of illogical reasoning", there is no error of law. That view was adopted by French, Hill and Marshall JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v W306/01A [2003] FCAFC 208. In W404/01A of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 255 , French, Lee and Carr JJ concluded that even if the reasoning of the Tribunal...were illogical, the authority shows that this is not, in itself, a ground of review, though it may on occasion manifest other reviewable error" [35]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 1589">The applicant contended that the Tribunal had drawn an inference that was not available on the evidence before it, as discussed in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [14] --- [32] and had fallen into error in the manner considered by Greenwood J at [32]: A determination of the Tribunal as to a state of satisfaction or otherwise, of the relevant criteria or criterion in question, that is based upon a finding of fact or inferences drawn from facts, not based on logical or rational grounds, will give rise to an error of jurisdiction if there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing the inference; or, if there be some evidence, although inadequate, reliance by the Tribunal upon that inadequate evidence gives rise to an inference that the Tribunal has misconceived the test or is not, in reality, satisfied of the requisite matters, as a result of which there has been only a purported, rather than a real, exercise of the power conferred upon the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FMCA 1433">In SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 1824 Greenwood J conducted a detailed review of the authorities, including the judgments of Gleeson CJ, and McHugh and Gummow JJ, in Re Minister for Immigration; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 69 ( " S20/2002 " ), stating at [14]: "... what is required is some precision in identifying the legal consequence of irrational or illogical reasoning and the legal principle to be invoked that attracts that consequence ( S20/2002 per Gleason [sic] CJ [5]). That task requires identifying and characterising the suggested error and relating it to 'the legal rubric under which a decision is challenged' ( S20/2002 per Gleason [sic] CJ [9]). " [emphasis in original] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FMCA 1297">Insofar as this ground involves a contention that the Tribunal's reasoning was illogical or irrational or perhaps based on unwarranted assumptions, such a contention is not made out (see the discussion in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [17] - [30] per Greenwood J). As Heerey, Sundberg and Crennan JJ observed in NATC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 52 at [27] : Opinions can vary upon what is inherently improbable or unacceptable as evidence of a fact or of what evidence "makes sense", that is whether evidence is probative in relation to a particular fact. In the absence of perversity or some manifest error sufficient to give rise to some jurisdictional error, the Court cannot intervene. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FMCA 1239">There is considerable authority to the effect that want of logic in itself does not show jurisdictional error (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v W306/01A [2003] FCAFC 208 ; W404/01A of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 255 ; NATC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 52 in which the Full Court of the Federal Court referred at [25] to NACB as it did in VWST ). In SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 Greenwood J reviewed some of the authorities in relation to illogical or irrational reasoning (at [17] --- [30]) before suggesting (at [31] --- [32]) that the central matter was as follows: [32] A determination of the Tribunal as to a state of satisfaction or otherwise, of the relevant criteria or criterion in question, that is based upon a finding of fact or inferences drawn from facts, not based on logical or rational grounds, will give rise to an error of jurisdiction if there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing the inference; or, if there be some evidence, although inadequate, reliance by the Tribunal upon that inadequate evidence gives rise to an inference that the Tribunal has misconceived the test or is not, in reality, satisfied of the requisite matters, as a result of which there has been only a purported, rather than a real, exercise of the power conferred upon the Tribunal. 
(and see SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1 at [42] per Flick J). However, as discussed below, in this case it has not been established that the Tribunal erred in such a manner. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] NSWSC 864">35 The second and third errors allege factual findings based on no evidence. There was brief debate on the question of the circumstances in which such an error would be treated as jurisdictional error. The Court was referred to certain decided cases (inter alia, SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 at paragraph 19; SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at paragraph 18). For present purposes, it is unnecessary to dwell on these alleged errors. It suffices to say that findings made concerning high density of gaming machines and higher than average per capita expenditure on gaming machines were contrary to the evidence and appear to have been determinative.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FMCA 1119">As Greenwood J stated in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [25] a strict view has been taken of the " no evidence " ground of challenge to a factual finding on the basis of illogical or irrational reasoning which involves " the need to demonstrate no material before the decision-maker which tends logically to show the existence or non-existence of facts or to show the likelihood or not of some future event occurring, relevant to the state of satisfaction to be formed. If there is some evidence (perhaps slight) to support a finding, a Court exercising judicial review ought not to interfere with the decision-maker's assessment of the material" (and see Quin at 35 --- 36 per Brennan J). In this case, there is some evidence to support a finding that there were differences in the applicant's evidence over time, particularly given the absence of any reference to a threat or demand by the Maoists in the protection visa application. No jurisdictional error is established on the basis contended for in the first particular to ground one in the further amended application. "Foreign NGO" issue

<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FCA 1063">31 As to the allegation of irrationality made in ground three, I have had the benefit of reading the transcript of the hearing before the current Tribunal. After carefully considering both that transcript and Mr Baird's submissions on the concerns I raised with him, I am satisfied that if the current Tribunal made any error in relation to these areas of concern (see [23] to [26] above), it would be an error of fact within the fact-finding jurisdiction of the Tribunal. More importantly, it would not be an error that pointed to irrationality on the part of the current Tribunal such as would vitiate its decision for jurisdictional error: see SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1824 per Greenwood J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2008] FCA 1019">23 In relation to ground 1(b), ie the alleged irrationality in the decision, Mr Silva relied upon the decision of Justice Tamberlin in SZEEO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 546 and the recent decision of Justice Greenwood in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 (' SZDTZ') . Based on these authorities, Mr Silva submitted there was no proper basis for the Tribunal to draw the inference that the evidence of Mr Gill was vague and that it was irrational or illogical for the Tribunal to give Mr Gill's evidence no weight. He submitted this was a critical reason why the Tribunal rejected the appellant's claims to suffer persecution for Convention-related reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] FMCA 857">It has not been established that the Tribunal's lack of satisfaction in relation to the applicant's claims in this or any other respect constituted illogical reasoning of the kind discussed in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex Parte Applicant S20/200 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 . This is not a case in which there was no evidence to support the Tribunal's findings. Nor has it been established that the decision was so unreasonable " that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it " in the sense considered in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; (1948) 1 KB 223 as discussed by Kenny J in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151at [60] --- [63]. The evidence before the Tribunal is not such as to give rise to an inference that the Tribunal misconceived the applicable test or was not in reality satisfied of the requisite matters, such that it could be said that there was only a purported rather than a real exercise of the powers conferred upon it under the Migration Act . (See the discussion of relevant authorities in relation to reasoning which is illogical or irrational or based on unwarranted assumptions in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [17] --- [32] per Greenwood J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2008] FCA 856">37 In SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 , Greenwood J reviewed many of the authorities on the distinction between an error of fact or law and jurisdictional error and concluded as follows, at [32]:
 'A determination of the Tribunal as to a state of satisfaction or otherwise, of the relevant criteria or criterion in question, that is based upon a finding of fact or inferences drawn from facts, not based on logical or rational grounds, will give rise to an error of jurisdiction if there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing the inference; or, if there be some evidence, although inadequate, reliance by the Tribunal upon that inadequate evidence gives rise to an inference that the Tribunal has misconceived the test or is not, in reality, satisfied of the requisite matters, as a result of which there has been only a purported, rather than a real, exercise of the power conferred upon the Tribunal. ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2008] FCA 570">41 It follows, the appellant contends, that the Tribunal based its decision on inadequate evidence and a finding based on inadequate evidence points to a misconstruction by the Tribunal of the test to be applied ( SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [32] per Greenwood J). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] FCA 390">42 But what does matter is whether such an error, when it does occur, can be characterised as a jurisdictional error. In the present circumstances it is considered that it can. In SFGB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 , 77 ALD 402 Mansfield, Selway and Bennett JJ observed:
 
 [19] ... If the Tribunal makes a finding and that finding is a critical step in its ultimate conclusion and there is no evidence to support that finding then this may well constitute a jurisdictional error ...
 

And, in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 Greenwood J reviewed some of the authorities (including SFGB ) and concluded:
 
 [31] The central matter is this. [32] A determination of the Tribunal as to a state of satisfaction or otherwise, of the relevant criteria or criterion in question, that is based upon a finding of fact or inferences drawn from facts, not based on logical or rational grounds, will give rise to an error of jurisdiction if there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing the inference; or, if there be some evidence, although inadequate, reliance by the Tribunal upon that inadequate evidence gives rise to an inference that the Tribunal has misconceived the test or is not, in reality, satisfied of the requisite matters, as a result of which there has been only a purported, rather than a real, exercise of the power conferred upon the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] FMCA 361">Finally, the applicant says that the decision made by the Tribunal is illogical. Greenwood J considered the question of illogicality in these matters in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1824. At [32] his Honour said: "A determination of the tribunal as to a state of satisfaction or otherwise of the relevant criteria or criterion in question that is based upon the finding of fact, or inferences drawn from facts, not based on logical or rational grounds, will give rise to an error of jurisdiction if there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing the inference or if there be some evidence, although inadequate, of reliance by the tribunal upon that inadequate evidence gives rise to an inference that the tribunal has misconceived the test, or is not, in reality, satisfied of the requisite matters as a result of which there has only been a purported rather than a real exercise of the power conferred on the tribunal. " 
In NATC v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCAFC 52 , the Full Bench noted at [26]:
 
 "The primary judge found: "The factual findings might, perhaps, not have been made by everybody, but that of itself is of no significance. " 

It then proceeded to say at [27]:
 
 "Opinions can vary upon what is inherently improbable or unacceptable as evidence of a fact or of what evidence "makes sense", that is whether evidence is probative in relation to a particular fact. In the absence of perversity or some manifest error sufficient to give rise to some jurisdictional error, the Court cannot intervene. " 
  Finally, the applicant says that the decision made by the Tribunal is illogical. Greenwood J considered the question of illogicality in these matters in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1824.
