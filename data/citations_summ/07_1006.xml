 Prior to the introduction of Div 7A, s 108 of the [Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth)] was an anti-avoidance provision intended to prevent private companies from distributing profits to shareholders and their associates tax free in the form of loans or other payments. Generally speaking, s 108 also operated to capture amounts paid or credited to a shareholder or a person associated with a shareholder, deeming such amounts to be dividends, which would therefore be included in assessable income of the recipient under s 44(1) of the [Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth)]. The deemed dividend was not, however, subject to dividend withholding tax and was unfrankable (that is, could not carry imputation credits to allow a rebate to the recipients for tax paid by the company).</sentence>
