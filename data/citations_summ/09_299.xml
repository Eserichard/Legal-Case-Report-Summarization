<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 744">Individual (did not appear in the proceedings): $5,000 for first contravention (23% of maximum); $2,200 for second contravention (10% of maximum). NOTE: the respondents were also separately penalised for contraventions arising under the WR Act. Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 299 
Union (previous contraventions, contraventions not admitted): $5,500 (5% of maximum). Cozadinos v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2010] FCA 48 
Union (previous contraventions, contraventions admitted; contraventions of s 38 and 43 of the BCII Act but as part of single course of conduct and subject to single maximum penalty): $40,000 total (36% of maximum). Individual (previous contraventions; contraventions admitted; contraventions of s 38 and 43 of the BCII Act but as part of single course of conduct and subject to single maximum penalty): $5,000 (23%).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1040">Of course, to say the Union is a large national organisation is not to deny that the Union is a non-profit-making enterprise, a consideration that has sometimes been taken into account in the Union's favour: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2004] FCA 517 at [8] per Gray J; Draffin v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 243 at [44] per Marshall J; and Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 299 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 787">There are three instances of similar previous conduct by the Union involving breaches of s 38 ; see Stuart-Mahoney, Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169 and Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 299. Although the relevant conduct in Temple , concerned breaches by the Western Australian Branch of the Union of s 38 of the Act, nevertheless the conduct is previous relevant conduct; see Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No. 2) [2009] FCA 548 per Jessup J at [22]---[25], see also Temple per Dowsett J at [63]. The second respondent has not engaged in any similar previous conduct. In contrast to the circumstances in Stuart-Mahoney, Temple and Duffy (No 2) , the respondents' conduct on 6 October 2006 was of limited duration and impact and penalties at the lower end of the scale are appropriate. </sentence>
