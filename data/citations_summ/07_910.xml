<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] HCATrans 219">It is AB v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 910 ; 96 ALD 53.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 2094">20 Second, reliance upon " International Conventions " as the source of a consideration which the Minister is " bound " to take into account is misplaced. In AB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 910 , 96 ALD 53 , Tracey J reviewed the authorities and observed:
 
 [20] The applicant acknowledges that the Minister would have been free to make her decision, under s 501(1) of the Act, without reference to the ICCPR, the CAT or any other international treaty which had not been incorporated in Australian domestic law. It is, however, contended that, once the Minister determined that she would take Australia's obligations under the ICCPR and the CAT into account, she was obliged to ascertain and apply the relevant treaty obligations according to their terms. If, in making her decision, the Minister misconstrued a treaty obligation and this had a material bearing on her decision, she could be said to have failed to have regard to a relevant consideration (the obligation correctly construed) or had regard to an irrelevant consideration (the misunderstood obligation).</sentence>
