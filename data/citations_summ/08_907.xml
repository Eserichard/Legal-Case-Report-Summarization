<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 920">It is an abuse of process to not raise issues in initial proceedings and then raise them in subsequent proceedings: Rana v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 907 per Lander J at [58]. "The jurisdiction of a superior court in such a case of abuse of process was described by Lord Diplock in Hunter v The Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police [1981] UKHL 13 ; (1982) AC 529 at [536] as the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right thinking people. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 629">The Federal Magistrate considered the circumstances in which a Court ought to exercise the power sought to be exercised by the respondent referring to an earlier decision of his own which he considered a decision of the Full Court of this Court in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited [2008] FCAFC 60 and a later decision of Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720. He accepted that where a real issue of fact existed such as to preclude summary judgment the Court should draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party citing Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (Formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 and Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; 236 ALR 720. He referred to a decision of mine in Rana v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 907 where I said that notwithstanding that the purpose of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) was to relax the test relating to summary dismissal, the Court still needed to be cautious about finding that an applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 40">By distinguishing between "hopeless" cases and those without reasonable prospects for success, the statute makes clear that the Court need not (indeed, must not) refuse summary judgment on the basis of a factual dispute said to arise only from a plausible, as opposed to a reasonable, inference. " 31. As was stressed by Lander J in Rana v Commonwealth of Australia (unreported decision, 17 June 2008, [2008] FCA 907) , notwithstanding that the purpose of s.31A was to relax the tests, a Court need still to be cautious about finding that an applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1555">35 In the grounds of appeal in the amended notice of appeal, four separate proceedings have been referred to. The first is matter SAD.111 of 2007, a matter which was dismissed as vexatious by a judge of this Court on 17 June 2008: Rana v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 907. An appeal from that decision is listed to be heard by the Full Court in November. The second is in matter SAD.47 of 2008: that is the matter which was summarily dismissed on 17 March 2008, and in which an application for an extension of time to appeal has been refused: see [25] above. The third is in matter SAD.48 of 2008 which was dismissed as an abuse of process on 3 April 2008, and in respect of which (by a judgment given today) an application for an extension of time within which to appeal from that judgment has been refused. The fourth proceeding is the proceeding in which the appellant had appealed from the order refusing to set aside the bankruptcy notice, an appeal which has also been dismissed by reason for judgment given today.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 1340">In Tom Ferguson v Virgin Blue Airlines Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 864 Bennett J set the maximum costs that could be awarded against the unsuccessful applicant in that human rights matter. In Pitt v One Steel Reinforcing Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 923 Justice Gray ordered the unsuccessful applicant to pay the respondent's costs in that human rights matter. In Rana v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 907 Lander J awarded costs against the unsuccessful applicant in that human rights matter that was found to be an abuse of process, and the applicant had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding. In Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 Justice Collier held that a human rights and/or discrimination case will not automatically be regarded as a proceeding in the public interest. In Theodore Xiros v Fortis Life Assurance Ltd [2001] FMCA 15 ; (2001) 162 FLR 433 Driver FM dismissed the application but declined to award costs to the respondent on the basis of a significant public interest element. On examination, the issues that are said to arise in proceedings subsequent to filing the application in SYG 2109 of 2006 should have been raised in SYG 2015 of 2006. Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 at [598] and [602]; Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 242 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10 at [37]. In those circumstances the proceedings are a manifest abuse Rana v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 907 per Justice Lander at [58]. As all the relevant proceedings are said to have arisen out of the matters terminated by HREOC, and they cannot be brought before the Court unless they do (s.46PO). They could all have been included in the initial application. In my opinion therefore leave should be refused. " It is an abuse of process to not raise all issues in the initial proceedings. Rana v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 907 per Lander J at [58]: "58 There is no doubt that the issues which are said to raise to arise in this proceeding should have been raised in the proceeding before Mansfield J: Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 at 598; Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) (2004) 146 FCR [10]. No explanation has been given for the failure to raise these issues in that proceeding. In those circumstances, this proceeding is a manifest abuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1381">Under s 31A, the Court is empowered to give judgment for a respondent to a proceeding where the Court is satisfied that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding. In considering whether a party has a reasonable prospect of success, the Court need not be satisfied that the proceeding is hopeless or bound to fail (s 31A(2)). In Rana v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 907 at [49] , Lander J said:
 Section 31A of the Federal Court Act was enacted by the legislature with full knowledge of the decisions of the High Court in relation to the summary dismissal of proceedings and, in particular, the decision of the High Court in Dey [1949] HCA 1 ; 78 CLR 62 at 91 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. It may be thought, in those circumstances, that the purpose of the enactment of s 31A was to relax the rigours of the test imposed by the High Court in General Steel Industries 112 CLR 125 as to the necessary circumstances in which a proceeding may be struck out summarily: Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 ; (2006) 65 ATR 222 and White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. So much is supported by the Attorney-General's second reading speech on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 (Cth) which was the legislative vehicle which introduced s 31A.</sentence>
