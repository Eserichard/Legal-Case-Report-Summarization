<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] FCA 484">8 The relevant provisions of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)('the Act'), including part 806 and the definition of 'special need relative' in reg 1.03, were repealed by statutory r 259 of 1999 reg 4 in Sch 2. However, the original visa application in the case before me pre-dates the repeal, and the legislation in force as at the date of the application continues to apply. This includes the definition of 'special need relative' as it stood before the repeal: McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Cohen (2001) 177 ALR 473 , cf for example Wahab v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 421. At the time of the application, the definition of 'special need relative' in reg 1.03 Migration Regulations read:
 
 '"special need relative", in relation to an Australian citizen usually resident in Australia, an Australian permanent resident usually resident in Australia or an eligible New Zealand citizen, means a relative who is willing and able to provide substantial and continuing assistance to the citizen or resident if: 
 
 
 (a) the citizen or resident has a permanent or long-term need for assistance because of death, disability, prolonged illness or other serious circumstances affecting the citizen or resident personally, or a member of his or her family unit; and 
 
 
 (b) the assistance cannot be reasonably obtained from 
 
 
 
 (i) any other relative of the citizen or resident, being a relative who is an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand resident; or 
 
 
 
 (ii) welfare, hospital, nursing or community services in Australia. ' </sentence>
