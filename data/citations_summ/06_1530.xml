<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWSC 1299">14 It is not in terms disputed that each of Wabbits and Vero is a person aggrieved (in the context considered in Westpac Banking Corporation v Totterdell (1998) 20 WAR 150 ; ASIC v Forestview Nominees Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1530 ; (2006) 236 ALR 652) , although the position asserted by Mr Godfrey seems to be that the second plaintiff (Vero) has no claim (having, it is said, invalidly admitted the claim by Wabbits under the policy) or that its claim, at most, could be for the amount paid out under the policy (it being asserted that there is no demonstrable intention on the part of Wabbits to pursue the building contract claim in separate proceedings). In written submissions served by Mr Godfrey's solicitor, Mr Tomaras, who appeared on the hearing for Mr Godfrey, it is said that it follows, in light of the settlement reached between Wabbits and Vero in respect of Wabbits' insurance claim, that:
 

 
 
 Absent the payment of $199,500, Wabbits and the owner [by which I understand there to be a reference to Mr and/or Mrs Kalyk] are of the view that there is no point in proceeding the [sic] against Mr Scarfone and/or [Scarfone Building Pty Limited] subject to deed of company arrangement and that on balance the proceedings ought not continue. The claims are choses in action; they are claims upon which damages would have to be assessed and determined. They are claims also for unliquidated damages, for which the plaintiffs through the affidavit of Francis Kalyk have indicated that they do not at any time intend to prosecute, nor that they inform that they propose to fund the liquidator to prosecute them.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWCA 64">67 The court's supervisory role is recognised in the frequently cited observations of McLelland J in Northbourne Developments (supra, at 438), where his Honour said of the predecessor to s 536 that it:
 

 
 
 " ... is concerned with aspects of the conduct of liquidators which are liable to attract sanctions or control for what might broadly be described as disciplinary reasons. "

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1943">60 A case of greater significance in the present circumstances is Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (ACN 063 440 102) (recs and mgrs apptd) [2006] FCA 1530 ; (2006) 236 ALR 652. In that case French J considered an application to review a refusal by receivers and managers to provide funding for legal representation to defend winding up proceedings and for an order that funding be provided. Forestview Nominees Pty Limited had granted a fixed and floating charge under which receivers and managers had been appointed. Thereafter Australian Securities and Investments Commission commenced winding up proceedings against the company. A director, Mr Carey, obtained leave to defend the proceedings in the name of the company. He applied to the receivers and managers for funding of $20,000 for legal representation for that purpose, which the receivers and managers refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 1710">2 The factual and procedural background to the present application was set out in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) [2006] FCA 1530 concerning an appeal against a decision by the receivers and managers to refuse to release funds for legal representation of the company in these proceedings. So that these reasons may be self contained, it is convenient to reproduce the bulk of the factual and procedural background set out in the earlier judgment. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 1628">5 On 30 October 2006 the application to wind up the company was adjourned to today. Following a request by Forestview's new solicitors to file further evidence in answer to affidavit evidence filed by the Forestview receivers, the judgment on the question of their decision to refuse funding was further reserved to 15 November 2006. On 15 November 2006 judgment was given refusing Forestview's appeal against the receiver's decision to decline funding: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) [2006] FCA 1530. </sentence>
