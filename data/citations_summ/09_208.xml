<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 177">It is, in my view, important that the applicants be fully apprised of the status of their motion of 14 December 2009. This is because there is a serious question as to whether this Court has in its appellate jurisdiction, the power to set aside a consent order. (See, SZJBW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1037 ; SZCZF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 208 ; (2009) 107 ALD 138 and MZXSV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1025. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1025">In reaching the conclusions set out above, I have derived assistance from the reasons of Flick J in SZCZF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 208 , in which his Honour was dealing with an application made in similar circumstances. His Honour's analysis confirms, in my view, the conclusions which I have reached. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 791">This raises the issue of the difficulty in setting aside an order obtained by consent. There is no considered judgment of the Court to use as a yardstick to assist in determining what might have occurred; see SZCZF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 208 , where Flick J discussed other difficulties in setting aside a consent order. </sentence>
