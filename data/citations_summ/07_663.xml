<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 18">As already recorded, the applicant submitted that the Tribunal had to identify the particular information given by the restaurant manger on which it relied, submitting that it was insufficient merely to provide a summary of the entire interview. Whether or not information is identified with sufficient specificity for the purposes of s.359A(1) of the Act will be a matter of fact, degree and context depending on the circumstances of the case: MZXKH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 663 at [18] . The test is an objective one, although one which must take the surrounding circumstances into account. As Tracey J said in MZXKH's case: Past dealings between an applicant and the Tribunal may have involved the adoption of terminology which, although it may lack clarity if addressed to a third party, will readily be comprehensible to the applicant.
