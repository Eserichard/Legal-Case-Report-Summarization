<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 417">That principle has been applied as the doctrine of incompatible offices in cases such as Egan v Maher [No. 2] (1978) 35 FLR 252 at 263, Mellor v Horn (1988) 25 IR 157 at 159 --- 161 and Johnson v Beitseen (1989) 41 IR 395 at 412 --- 413. In Re Cholosznecki; Re Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union [2006] FCA 452 (2006) 151 IR 218 , the principle of implied surrender was applied in determining that a member of an organisation had surrendered her membership of one of its branches by applying to become, and being accepted and treated as, a member of another branch, where membership of more than one branch was expressly prohibited by the rules. The principle operates by implication of law, rather than by implied intention. The intention is imputed to a person, as a result of the assumption of a second position incompatible with the first, to relinquish the first position.</sentence>
