<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 144">The Federal Court has observed that: 21. Section 31A [of the FC Act] is not a vehicle for simply striking out parts of pleadings that are deficient. Section 31A allows for "judgment" or nothing. Alternative remedies with respect to deficient pleadings must be found in the rules of Court. In this connection I respectfully disagree with the approach taken by Heerey J in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 in which his Honour said (at [6]): Plainly s 31A [of the FC Act] was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeouts (either of claims or defences) than that previously laid down by the High Court's decisions in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1948) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130, namely that the allegations are "so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed".

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1431">The Plaintiffs prosecute their summary judgment application on the basis of pleaded facts and evidence. Messrs Angeleri, Brindley and O'Brien have each sworn affidavits in response to those relied on by the Plaintiffs. In these circumstances the Court is required to form the necessary judgment, for the purposes of s 31A(1), on the basis of this material and to consider whether the evidence "reasonably excludes the possibility that facts essential to the success of the ... defence will be able to be established": see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] (per French J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 919">Judgment under s 31A can be given by reference to pleadings where there is a defect in the pleadings which cannot be cured or by reference to evidence which reasonably excludes the possibility that the facts essential to the claim will be able to be established ( Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Limited v Jones (2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] per French J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] WASC 147">One principle is that the moving party bears the onus of persuading the court that the opponent has no reasonable prospect of success (see Crayford Freight Services Ltd v Coral Seatel Navigation Co (1998) 82 FCR 328 at 333). As noted earlier, however, s 31A has lessened the standard that must be met. In that regard, it must be emphasised that once a moving party has established a prima facie case that the opponent has no reasonable prospect of success, the opposing party must respond by pointing to specific factual or evidentiary disputes that make a trial necessary; general or non-particularized denials will be insufficient to defeat the motion: see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [22] . In other words, it is inappropriate in defence of a claim for judgment under s 31A of the Federal Court Act to seek to defend by merely putting a claimant to formal proof: Vans, Inc v OffpriceComAu Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 at [12] . This is not a new concept. It finds earlier reflection in ss 190(4) and 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and O 33, O 34 and O 34B of the Federal Court Rules (Cth). ... 

 A fifth principle is that where there is a real issue of fact relevant to a pleaded cause of action, it is unlikely that that part of the proceeding has no prospect of success: see Boston Commercial Services at [44]. So, for example, if the pleadings, affidavits, and other materials considered in connection with the summary judgment motion, reveal a factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether or not the claim succeeds, it cannot be said that the claim has 'no reasonable prospect of success': see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] (stating that summary judgment should be made by reference to the pleadings, affidavits, and other evidence as appropriate under the circumstances) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 1416 at [32] . On the other hand, if the factual contest is unnecessary to the resolution of the cause of action pleaded, then in the absence of other relevant material, there is nothing to prevent the court entering judgment on that claim [127], [130].

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] FMCA 5">In Balding v Ten Talents Pty Ltd [27] this Court agreed with the views of the Federal Court in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [28] where the Federal Court observed that s.31A of the FC Act " allows for 'judgment' or nothing " [29] and this Court agreed with that view as being applicable to summary dismissal applications before this Court, [30] and further observed that: " This judgment or nothing approach must of course be appropriately exercised having regard to the principles established in Boston Commercial, and in the manner prescribed in MG Distribution and Rana. " [31]  In Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [25] the Federal Court summarised the relevant principles applicable to a summary dismissal application as follows: Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings; (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial; (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial; (h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects; (i) in determining if there are real issues of fact in issue so as to preclude summary judgment the courts must draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party.

 Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] . Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: 
 
 
 (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings;
 (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; 
 (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; 
 (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial;
 (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; 
 (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial;
 (h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects; 
 (i) in determining if there are real issues of fact in issue so as to preclude summary judgment the courts must draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party. See Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 923 at [5] ; Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [42] - [48]; Hicks v Ruddock (2007) 156 FCR 574 at [13]; Bond v Barry (2007) 73 IPR 490 at [46]; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in Liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 at [30] ; Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [21] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited [2008] FCAFC 60.

 29 Because of their present relevance, I will refer to the observations of French J in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] where his Honour said that that judgment may be made:
 
 
 ... by reference to evidence put on in support of an application under s31A which reasonably excludes the possibility that facts essential to the success of the claim or defence will be able to be established.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FMCA 957">Of particular relevance is the view of French J (as he then was) in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No.2) [2006] FCA 1401 that s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act " is not a vehicle for simply striking out parts of pleadings that are deficient" (at [21]). While his Honour was considering s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act , rule 13.10 reflects the approach taken in s.17A of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth) (FMA) (the equivalent of s.31A). French J explained his views in Fortron at [19] --- [21] as follows: The question which has to be answered in an application for judgment under s 31A is whether the party against whom the application is made has any "reasonable prospect" of successfully prosecuting or defending "the proceeding" or the "part of the proceeding" in issue.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] FCA 368">Pursuant to s 31A , the Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if it is satisfied that the party prosecuting the claim has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting it. It is expressly emphasised that for the purposes of s 31A , a proceeding need not be hopeless or be bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success. The section has been discussed in numerous cases including Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401. It is clear that it is open to the Court to consider evidence in the context of such an application and it is clear that the language of the section imposes a different and less stringent test to the former test described in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129-130. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] FCA 332">The observations of French J in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [19] - [21] are particularly useful in distinguishing between the requirements for a summary judgment under s 31A and a strike out as discussed below. His Honour observed that s 31A renders judgment, and is thus distinct from a strike out, which can be followed by the amendment of a pleading. Thus judgment should only be entered where no amendment of pleadings or particulars is possible, that is, where there is a defect in the pleadings which cannot be cured. Order 11 rule 16 of the Rules
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2009] FCA 436">The question for determination in an application under s 31A is whether Mr Cockrell has any reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting these proceedings. That question is not answered by a finding that a party's pleading is defective, since pleadings may be rectified by amendments, so as to raise reasonable causes of action or defence. Thus, as French J explained in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Limited v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [19] - [21], the fact that a pleading should be struck out under O 20 does not mean there must be judgment against the party whose pleading it is, provided that there is a reasonable prospect that by an amendment it could be successfully prosecuted or defended. He pointed out that in order to secure a judgment under s 31A the moving party must show that the other has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting or defending the claim. That determination can be made by reference to pleadings where there is a defect in the pleadings that cannot be cured, or it can be dealt with by evidence. But, s 31A is not a vehicle for simply striking out parts of deficient pleadings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2009] FCA 256">In the main, Deckers prosecutes its summary judgment application on the basis of pleaded facts and evidence as distinct from issues of law. In these circumstances the Court is required to form the necessary judgment on the basis of the pleadings and the evidence tendered by Deckers and to consider whether the evidence "reasonably excludes the possibility that facts essential to the success of the ..... defence will be able to be established": see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2009] FCAFC 6">44 In Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [19] - [21], French J said: 
 
 
 [19] The question which has to be answered in an application for judgment under s 31A is whether the party against whom the application is made has any "reasonable prospect" of successfully prosecuting or defending "the proceeding" or the "part of the proceeding" in issue. That question is not to be answered by a finding that a party's statement of claim or defence fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action or defence. A pleading may be rectified by amendment so as to raise a reasonable cause of action or defence. 48 While Bowen LJ was speaking of an amendment, the general principle applied by Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in J L Holdings 189 CLR at 154, is apposite here: Fortron [2006] FCA 1401 at [19] . The primary judge was faced with the position where Mr Wills had explained orally, but not on oath, what his case was. He had failed to comply with one direction to file an affidavit outlining what he had said orally on 2 April 2008 and supplementing that account with greater detail. When he appeared on 14 May, Mr Wills was in default. His Honour did not invite Mr Wills to verify, in the witness box, what he had previously said, or explain to him again that a failure to put on the affidavit material that he had been directed to file could be fatal to the proceedings continuing.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2008] FMCA 1374">It is true that summary dismissal applications are to be determined on the pleadings and any evidence before the Court; but at the heart of the exercise is the assessment on incomplete materials, of the prospects of success if the matter proceeds to a final hearing; Boston Commercial at [38], [48]. It would be wrong to determine the application on a narrow approach to the pleadings where, as here, there is evidence, albeit incomplete, and perhaps at this early stage, ambivalent, which may at a final hearing, and with amended pleadings, produce a verdict for the applicant. Further guidance was provided by French J in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 (decided on 27 October 2006) at [19]-[21]. His Honour said: The question which has to be answered in an application for judgment under s 31A is whether the party against whom the application is made has any "reasonable prospect" of successfully prosecuting or defending "the proceeding" or the "part of the proceeding" in issue. That question is not to be answered by a finding that a party's statement of claim or defence fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action or defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2008] FMCA 1340">
 31. In the Federal Court in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1401 ("Fortron (No. 2)") French J respectfully disagreed with the approach to s.31A of the FCA Act adopted by Heery J in Duncan. In Fortron (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] FMCA 984">The question here, as was discussed by French J in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1401 , is whether the applicant has any "reasonable prospect" of successfully prosecuting "the proceeding" or the "part of the proceeding" in issue. Section 17A is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance not just with form: White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation at [50] per Lindgren J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] FMCA 947">Therefore, to the extent that previous decisions of the Federal Court may be understood as suggesting that s 31A confers a general discretion (eg Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ), such a construction of the statutory language is rejected. [130] A fifth principle is that where there is a real issue of fact relevant to a pleaded cause of action, it is unlikely that that part of the proceeding has no prospect of success: see Boston Commercial Services at [44]. So, for example, if the pleadings, affidavits, and other materials considered in connection with the summary judgment motion, reveal a factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether or not the claim succeeds, it cannot be said that the claim has "no reasonable prospect of success": see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] (stating that summary judgment should be made by reference to the pleadings, affidavits, and other evidence as appropriate under the circumstances) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 1416 at [32] . On the other hand, if the factual contest is unnecessary to the resolution of the cause of action pleaded, then in the absence of other relevant material, there is nothing to prevent the court entering judgment on that claim. [131] By contrast, the existence of a real issue of law does not necessarily preclude summary judgment. One principle is that the moving party bears the onus of persuading the court that the opponent has no reasonable prospect of success (see Crayford Freight Services Ltd v Coral Seatel Navigation Co (1998) 82 FCR 328 at 333). As noted earlier, however, s 31A has lessened the standard that must be met. In that regard, it must be emphasised that once a moving party has established a prima facie case that the opponent has no reasonable prospect of success, the opposing party must respond by pointing to specific factual or evidentiary disputes that make a trial necessary; general or non-particularized denials will be insufficient to defeat the motion: see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [22]. In other words, it is inappropriate in defence of a claim for judgment under s 31A of the Federal Court Act to seek to defend by merely putting a claimant to formal proof: Vans, Inc v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 at [12] . This is not a new concept. A comprehensive review of the relevant authorities was undertaken by Driver FM in Vivid Entertainment LLC &amp; Ors v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FMCA 157. After reviewing relevant authorities including Vans, Inc v offprice.com.au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 ; Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia [2006] FCA 1352 ; Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v CAN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 ; Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 and Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 Driver FM at [30] preferred the approach of Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia . </sentence>

A fifth principle is that where there is a real issue of fact relevant to a pleaded cause of action, it is unlikely that that part of the proceeding has no prospect of success: see Boston Commercial Services at [44].

This is not a new concept. The question of the precise meaning of s 31A of the FCA Act and s 17A of the FM Act and of any change they have made has already been the subject of numerous decisions in this Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. The most recent review of them of which I am aware is that of Driver FM on 19 March 2007 in Vivid Entertainment LLC v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 157 at [18] - [28]. The authorities to which his Honour referred are: Howard v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2006] FMCA 975 ; MG Distribution Pty Ltd v Khan [2006] FMCA 666 ; Cate v International Flavours and Fragrances (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 36 ; Vans Inc v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 ; Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 701 IPR 146 ; Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 ; Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227 ; Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; (2006) 150 IR 471 ; Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 1441 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 ; Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 ; Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299. Not one of these cases was a migration case. In other words, the task of exploring the meaning of s 31A has arisen in a wide range of the cases in the Federal Magistrates Court and this Court, with the striking exception of migration cases, no doubt for the reason that I mentioned earlier: the provision is of no practical importance in them.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs28" from="[2008] FCA 849">36 It is a nice question whether s 31A can be invoked in relation to grounds of review that seem untenable. The section permits judgment to be given in favour of one party against another only, and does not address grounds of review as such: see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401. Order 54 r 7(1)(a) of the Rules, which governs applications brought under the ADJR Act , provides that a party may apply to the Court for "judgment" in an application for an order for review under O 20 r 2 or s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act . Order 54 r 7(1)(b) enables a party to apply to have an application for an order of review stayed or dismissed under O 20 r 4 or r 5. It follows that the Court can dismiss a "claim for relief" in a particular proceeding if that claim constitutes an abuse of process. </sentence>

So, for example, if the pleadings, affidavits, and other materials considered in connection with the summary judgment motion, reveal a factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether or not the claim succeeds, it cannot be said that the claim has "no reasonable prospect of success": see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] (stating that summary judgment should be made by reference to the pleadings, affidavits, and other evidence as appropriate under the circumstances) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 1416 at [32] . On the other hand, if the factual contest is unnecessary to the resolution of the cause of action pleaded, then in the absence of other relevant material, there is nothing to prevent the court entering judgment on that claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs31" from="[2008] FCA 395">4 Furthermore, as Greenwood J pointed out in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Limited [2007] FCA 195 (at [59] --- [60]), s 31A is not directed to striking out pleadings but proceedings as a whole. He referred to the judgment of French J in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401. Greenwood J said that the necessary state of satisfaction 'will rarely be achieved (except in the most transparent of cases) on the strength of a conclusion that the applicant's statement of claim is deficient either in whole or in part' because of the facility for leave to replead. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs32" from="[2008] FCA 59">28 In Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] French J set out what the moving party must show: 
 
 
 "in order to secure judgment under s31A it must be shown that the party prosecuting or defending the proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. This judgment may be made, by reference to pleadings, where there is a defect in the pleadings which cannot be cured. Alternatively, it may be a judgment made by reference to evidence put on in support of an application under s31A which reasonably excludes the possibility that facts essential to the success of the claim or defence will be able to be established".  5 The hearing of the CBA's application proceeded over a part of each of three days: on 11, 17 and 20 December 2007. On the first day I gave Mr Farquhar leave to file and serve an amended notice of motion which relied upon section 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act as the CBA's primary application and, in the alternative, relied upon O 20 r 5 and O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules . This issue arose during submissions because the CBA's original notice of motion filed on 16 November 2007 made no mention of section 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act , nor O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules , yet the CBA's written submissions filed on 4 December 2007 relied upon both of these provisions. There is, of course, a significant difference in the nature and effect of an application under section 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act on the one hand, and an application under O 20 r 5, or O 11 r 16, on the other. The former application strikes at the heart of the whole proceedings and, if successful, can only result in a judgment to the opposite party, whereas the latter type of application is usually directed to the way in which the case has been pleaded and more often than not, dealt with by allowing the offending party to file an amended pleading: see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [19] to [21] per French J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs33" from="[2008] FCA 55">10 In PZ Cussons (International) Limited v Rosa Dora Imports Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1642 at [14] Kenny J provides a summary of observations that have been made in relation to the power conferred by s 31A. I gratefully adopt her Honour's summary:
 
 ... the occasion for summary judgment must be clear before it will be granted: see Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 at [13] per Tamberlin J. Summary judgment is inappropriate where there is a real dispute about the relevant facts and evidence: see Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 489 at [10] per Besanko J and Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v G E Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [31] to [48] per Rares J; Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Limited [2006] FCA 1441 at [23] per Tracey J; and Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] per French J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs34" from="[2007] FMCA 2104">This is not a case where deficiencies in pleading are asserted which would raise issues such as was seen in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 and in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1401. The question here, as was discussed by French J in the Fortron case, is whether the party against whom the application is made has any "reasonable prospect" of successfully prosecuting "the proceeding" or the "part of the proceeding" in issue. In White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation at [50] Lindgren J said that s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance not just with form. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs35" from="[2007] FCA 1959">13 Section 31A was inserted on 1 December 2005. The provision strengthens the power of the Court to enter summary judgment where it is satisfied that there are " no reasonable prospects of success ". For this purpose a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be " hopeless " or " bound to fail ". Section 31A, it has been accepted, introduces a lower standard for strike-outs than that previously laid down by the High Court decisions in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries v Commissioner for Railways [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 , namely that allegations are " So clearly untenable that they cannot possibly succeed ". See also Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 at [12] ---[13], 156 FCR 574. A party can establish that a case has " no reasonable prospects of success " where there is a defect in the pleadings which cannot be cured, or alternatively, by reference to evidence put on in support of an application under s 31A which reasonably excludes the possibility that facts essential to the success of the claim or defence will be able to be established: see Fortron Automotive Treatments v Jones [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] per French J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs36" from="[2007] FMCA 1788">I suggest that the legislature's intention was to lower the bar for summary dismissal below the level that had been fixed. "

Support can also be found for the statement of French J in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 , where his Honour disagreed with Heerey J's view in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 that "[s]ection 31A was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeouts". French J considered that s.31A "allows for "judgment" or nothing" at [21]; see also JT Nominees Pty Ltd v Macks [2007] SASC 151 at [81] per Bleby J. A detailed consideration of the operation of s.31A was undertaken by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 where his Honour reviewed several relevant authorities and stated at [44]-[45]:
 
 "In a case to which s.31A applies, where there is a real issue of fact to be decided in the sense identified in the above principle, and, possibly, where there is a real issue of law of a similar kind, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial.</sentence>

8 In the case of Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 , French J observed at [20]:

<sentence id="cs39" from="[2007] FMCA 1360">The question of the precise meaning of s.31A of the FCA Act and s.17A of the FM Act and of any change they have made has already been the subject of numerous decisions in this Court and the Federal Magistrates Court.

Section 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act is not directed to striking out pleadings or to dismissing an action where the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action. Nevertheless, the observations of Heerey J are, with respect, correct insofar so as they apply to a summary judgment application under s 31A. </sentence>
