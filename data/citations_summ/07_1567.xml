<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] HCATrans 252">HIS HONOUR: Yes, this is [2007] FCA 1567.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 7">3 The application for preliminary discovery was refused by Graham J and Telstra sought leave to appeal against his Honour's decision: Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No 3) [2007] FCA 1567. At the commencement of the hearing before the Full Court, and upon, it must be said, very short notice to the Court that this was contemplated, proposed consent orders were tendered providing for leave to appeal to be granted, the appeal to be allowed and preliminary discovery to be given on the basis sought by Telstra.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1560">This is consistent with the view in the present case that, since preliminary discovery is ancillary in nature and part of the larger dispute, no substantive rights are finally determined until a decision is made in the contemplated substantive application. This conclusion is consistent with that of Graham J in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No. 3) [2007] FCA 1567 at [70] .
