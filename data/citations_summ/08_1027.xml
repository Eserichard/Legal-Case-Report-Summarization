<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 8">On 10 July 2008, the Court rejected an interlocutory application by Kooee to dismiss the proceeding; see Primus Telecommunications Pty Ltd v Kooee Communications Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1027. At [2] in the interlocutory judgment, the Court described Kooee's contentions as follows: 
 
 In essence, Kooee contends that the claims made by Primus in the current proceeding should have been raised in an earlier proceeding between the two companies in the New South Wales Supreme Court. Kooee submits that the two proceedings arise out of substantially the same facts and that the current proceeding will give rise to the possibility of a judgment inconsistent with that obtained in New South Wales. Kooee further contends that no special circumstances apply to avoid the conclusion that it was unreasonable for Primus to have refrained from raising its current claims in the earlier proceeding.

 Gibbs v Kinna is a case that has been followed and applied on a number of occasions, most recently by Marshall J in Primus Telecommunications Pty Ltd v Kooee Communications Pty Ltd [48] and the Full Federal Court in Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1316">1 The Applicant, Kooee Communications Pty Ltd ("Kooee"), seeks an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of Marshall J dismissing a motion for summary judgment on Anshun estoppel grounds: Primus Telecommunications Pty Ltd v Kooee Communications Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1027. For the reasons that follow, the interlocutory judgment is neither attended by sufficient doubt nor would it give rise to substantial injustice, if leave to appeal were denied, to warrant the grant of an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal. The amended notice of motion filed on 12 August 2008 will be dismissed with costs.
