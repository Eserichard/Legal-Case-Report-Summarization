<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 618">The existence of the appeal process is sufficient to remove reliance on breach of any duty of care. 
 
 His Honour then summarised the findings made by the Federal Court in Scott 2000 and the Full Court decision in Scott 2003 . He also referred to the decision of Heerey J in Wang v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 898. In my opinion, the decisions I have referred to above make it clear that even if Centrelink officers acted negligently, that is, they did not meet the requisite standard of care, where that can be rectified by one of the three appeal processes available to Centrelink applicants, the Secretary does not owe applicants a common law duty of care. Furthermore, the Act does not provide that the Secretary owes a duty of care to social security applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1487">This Court has reached similar conclusions in Scott v Secretary, Department of Social Security [2000] FCA 1241 ; (2000) 65 ALD 79 , Scott v Pedler [2004] FCAFC 67 and Wang v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 898. In Scott v Secretary , in the joint judgment of Beaumont and French JJ at [19] they said: We agree with the trial Judge that the Act is not to be interpreted as indicating an intention to confer a private right of action for a breach of any of its provisions now in question, given especially the existence in the legislation of particular mechanisms for the review of decisions made within the department. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 965">Moreover and at a general level, this Court has no jurisdiction of general oversight of the administrative efficiency of Federal Government entities ( Wang v Secretary, Department of Employment &amp; Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 898 at [48] per Heerey J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1389">Centrelink refers to various judgments which hold that where an exercise of statutory power is subject to a right of review and the decision-maker exercises the power in good faith, no duty of care in the exercise of that power arises. [75] Centrelink says the theory behind this principle is that the existence of the appeal process can 'cure' any negligence associated with the exercise of statutory power.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 561">

20 Centrelink contends that, even if the application were amended to disclose a cause of action for damages, the application would have no reasonable prospects of success in light of the decisions in Scott [2000] FCA 1241 , Pedler [2004] FCAFC 67 and Wang [2006] FCA 898. Further and in addition, there may also be limitation issues arising in relation to any, as yet unidentified cause of action given that some of the problems are said to stem from as early as 1975.  

19 In Wang [2006] FCA 898 , Heerey J held at [48]:
 
 
 48 The claims of the applicants are not within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. The Court does not have jurisdiction to try criminal offences such as fraud and conspiracy. Breaches of the Social Security Act do not confer private rights for damages: Scott v Secretary Department of Social Security [2000] FCA 1241 ; (2000) 65 ALD 79 at [24] , Scott v Pedler [2004] FCAFC 67 at [1] , [53], [93], [102-103] and [106]. Nor is there any duty of care owed: Scott v Pedler . The Federal Court does not have a jurisdiction of general oversight of the administrative efficiency of federal government entities.  23 The Court only has such jurisdiction as is conferred on it by the Commonwealth Parliament together with any associated or accrued jurisdiction over non-Federal claims arising out of the transactions and facts which are common to the federal claims. That is established in many decisions, one of which is Wang [2006] FCA 898 at [47] - [49] (from which I repeat [48] so that paragraph is in context):
 
 
 47 In their submissions the applicants submit "the Federal Court has general power to hear all matters subject only to express legislative restriction". This is fundamentally incorrect. Section 19(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) provides that the Court "has such original jurisdiction as is vested in it by laws made by the Parliament". 17 This Court has reached similar conclusions in Scott v Secretary, Department of Social Security [2000] FCA 1241 , Scott v Pedler [2004] FCAFC 67 and Wang v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 898. In Scott [2000] FCA 1241 , in the joint judgment of Beaumont and French JJ at [19] they said:
 
 
 19 We agree with the trial Judge that the Act is not to be interpreted as indicating an intention to confer a private right of action for a breach of any of its provisions now in question, given especially the existence in the legislation of particular mechanisms for the review of decisions made within the Department. </sentence>
