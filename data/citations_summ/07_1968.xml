<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] HCATrans 322">I would seek to come to those decisions by an indirect route by taking you to another document that I have provided to the Court and that is a judgment of Justice Weinberg in Owens v Lofthouse [2007] FCA 1968.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] SASC 152">ASIC documents and company records apparently signed by the plaintiff indicate that she later appointed the second defendant as a director of Cosmetic Co and resigned her own directorship - the plaintiff acknowledged that she had signed all but one of the documents - finding that the plaintiff had also signed the remaining document - whether it was necessary for the plaintiff to intend subjectively to effect the appointment of the second defendant and her own resignation when signing the respective documents - whether evidence of the plaintiff's subjective intention was admissible. Held: absent claims such as non est factum, mistake, misrepresentation or duress, evidence of the plaintiff's subjective intention was not required nor admissible before effect could be given to the documents she signed - in any event, the plaintiff did intend, when signing the documents, to appoint the second defendant as a director and to resign her own directorship - accordingly, the plaintiff is no longer a director of Cosmetic Co - the second defendant is a director of Cosmetic Co.
 
 Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 201A , s 205B , s 1274 , s 1274B , referred to. Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Queensland) v Jolliffe [1920] HCA 45 ; (1920) 28 CLR 178 ; Frederick v State of South Australia [2006] SASC 165 ; (2006) 94 SASR 545 ; Hyhonie Holdings Pty Ltd v Leroy [2004] NSWCA 72 ; Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 ; Owens v Lofthouse [2007] FCA 1968 ; Wilton v Farnworth [1948] HCA 20 ; (1948) 76 CLR 646 , applied. B &amp; M Property Enterprises Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Pettingill [2001] SASC 75 ; Poliwka v Heven Holdings Pty Ltd (1992) 8 ACSR 747 ; Starr v Starr [1935] SASR 263 ; Wood v Smith [1993] Ch 90 , distinguished. Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 ; Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 ; Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; 219 CLR 165 ; Tranchita v Retravision (WA) Pty Ltd [2001] WASCA 265 ; Turner v Wyndever [2003] NSWSC 1147 , discussed. Next, Mr Ower referred to two trust cases in which evidence was admitted on the question of whether a document had been intended to operate as a binding declaration of trust: B &amp; M Property Enterprises Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Pettingill [22] and Starr v Starr . [23] These authorities were influenced by the doctrines of equity involved in the enforcement of a trust. It is well established that the existence of a trust is to be determined by reference to the subjective intention of the putative trustee. [24] However, I do not understand these cases to stand for some more general proposition that parol evidence is always admissible, even in the absence of a plea of some vitiating element, to establish that a signing party did not intend the transaction to which his or her signature stands witness. In any event, the present circumstances are more analogous to those arising in the contract cases than to those in the trust cases. </sentence>
