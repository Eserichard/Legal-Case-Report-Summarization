<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 462">The conduct by Carter was extreme and, in my view, completely unacceptable. Courts have previously stressed the need for such behaviour by union organisers to be deterred and I accept those observations as guiding in this instance. I note, for instance, the observations made by Dowsett J in Wilson v Nesbitt [4] where his Honour made such statements. That is consistent with my findings here. The conduct was quite extreme and completely unacceptable.</sentence>
