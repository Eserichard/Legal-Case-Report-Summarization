<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1413">Pursuant to O 62 r 4(2)(c) the Court may order that, instead of taxed costs, costs be awarded as a gross sum. The purpose of the order is to "save the parties the time, trouble, delay, expense and aggravation in having a taxation proceed on a matter": Keen v Telstra Corp Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 930 at [4]; Nine Films &amp; Television Pty Limited v Ninox Television Limited [2006] FCA 1046 ; Macquarie Bank Ltd v Seagle (2008) 79 IPR 72 ; [2008] FCA 1417 at [30] . The power is not confined and may be exercised whenever the circumstances warrant its exercise: Su v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (No 3) [2008] FCA 2018 at [1] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1437">Registration of a domain name may constitute conduct falling within s 52: e.g. CSR Ltd v Resource Capital Australia Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 279 , 128 FCR 408 ; Macquarie Bank Ltd v Seagle [2008] FCA 1417 , 79 IPR 72. Indeed, as in the present proceeding, in intellectual property cases it is not uncommon for a plaintiff to contend that the conduct of a respondent in using a domain name or a business name constitutes not only a contravention of ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act and the tort of passing off, but also a contravention of the Trade Marks Act : Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Ltd (No 1) [2008] FCA 1760 , 79 IPR 454 ; SAP Australia Pty Ltd v Sapient Australia Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1821 , 169 ALR 1. </sentence>
