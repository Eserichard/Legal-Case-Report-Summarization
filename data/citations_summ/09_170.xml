<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 61">52 I do wish to say something of the judgment of Jessup J in ABC v Sage [2009] FCA 170 ; (2009) 107 ALD 614 ( Sage ). The reason for this is that the Examiner in the present case regarded Sage as authority authorising the questioning and compelling of answers to questions, even though these questions directly concerned the charge the person summoned was facing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1038">ABC v Sage [2009] FCA 170 ( Sage ) concerned an attack, inter alia, on the legality of an examination summons under s 28 of the ACC Act. The summons contained a note that the applicant "will not be examined in relation to charges currently before the courts". At one point in the examination, that applicant objected to answering a question because it would reveal an element of his intended defence to the serious criminal charges laid against him. The examiner ruled that he must answer the question. </sentence>
