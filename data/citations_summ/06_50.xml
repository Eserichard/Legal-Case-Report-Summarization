<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 997">Also to be taken into account is an observation made by Tamberlin J in United Salvage v Louis Dreyfus Armateurs SNC [2006] FCA 50 at [7] . His Honour there made the observation, with which I respectfully agree, that a notice to produce differs in relation to a subpoena in the sense that one might apprehend that the party which receives the notice to produce has a greater awareness of the issues in the proceeding. To this extent, a more benign approach might be taken in relation to the application of the two criteria described by Beaumont J in the Arnotts case in relation to a subpoena, when one is considering a notice to produce. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1075">11 Even if leave were sought, I would not be disposed to grant it. The present is a hopeless case. This is the second occasion in which the appellant has instituted proceedings for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in March 2004. There is no suggestion that the appellant seeks to challenge the decision on any new ground. Res judicata can operate as a bar to a judicial review application in these circumstances: see, for example, MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 466 at [11] referring to Wong v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 204 ALR 722 at [71]; and MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 507 at [15] . Even if the circumstances did not give rise to res judicata, these second judicial review proceedings would attract an Anshun estoppel: see Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589. Such an estoppel bars a party from raising any point which properly belonged to the subject of earlier litigation that the party, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time of the earlier proceeding. Furthermore, there is nothing to support the appellant's contention that the course taken by the Federal Magistrate on this occasion was so unfair or otherwise affected by error that it ought be set aside on appeal. </sentence>
