<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 169">24 In Richardson v Leonard Cohen &amp; Co [2008] FCA 1392 Gilmour J considered a similar issue albeit in the context of the making of a sequestration order. At [12]-[14] Gilmour J summarised the relevant principles as follows:
 [12] The Court, considering the petition, may, in its discretion, accept a judgment as satisfactory proof, or not, of the petitioning creditor's debt. Such a judgment is prima facie evidence of the antecedent debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1695">In these preliminary proceedings, as Gilmore J stated in Richardson v Leonard Cohen &amp; Co [2008] FCA 1392 at [14] , it is not necessary for the debtor to prove that he is " not, in truth and reality, indebted to the petitioning creditor . " What is required is that the debtor show (in the sense considered in Wolff v Donovan ) that there is " substantial reason for questioning whether there is ... a debt": Jooss&eacute; v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation at [6] per North and Finkelstein JJ. It is necessary to determine whether "sufficient facts have been shown to suggest that an investigation into the judgment should be pursued" (Wolff v Donovan at [17]). Evidence before the Court
