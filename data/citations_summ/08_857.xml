<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1609">27 The fact that the Tribunal did not use the language of " hardship " that would be suffered by the Applicant -- as opposed to the " hardship " that would be occasioned to others -- it is considered, is not decisive. That which is decisive against the Applicant is the fact that the Tribunal considered the entirety of the evidence, including the evidence as to the effect that the decision would have upon him. Subject to a proper application of Direction No 21 , the weight to be given to the considerations addressed is a matter for the Tribunal alone: cf Black v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 189 at [33] ---[37] [2007] FCAFC 189 ; , 99 ALD 1 at 8---9; Tapel v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 857 at [27] . </sentence>
