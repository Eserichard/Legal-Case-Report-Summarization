<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 20">27 It has been observed that subrule (1) is independent of subrule (2) and, therefore, that the circumstance that the proceeding could have been brought in another more suitable court is not relevant to the exercise of the court's discretion under subrule (1): see McCormick v Riverwood International (Australia) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 32 , [22] and Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 844 , [3]. In Metro on George Bennett J said: (64 IPR at 58 [7])
 I agree that the two subrules are to be considered independently. Where the court is of the view that the proceedings should have been brought in another court or where judgment is for a sum less than $100,000 and the circumstances are such that the court should not exercise its discretion to reduce the amount allowable for costs, there will be a reduction in the costs to be paid by one-third. Subrule (1) of O 62 r 36A operates only when a party is awarded judgment for less than $100,000 on a claim for a money sum or damages. In such a case, the subrule sets up a presumption that the costs ordered to be paid should be reduced by one third of the amount otherwise allowable. It is for the party who would be entitled to the benefit of the costs order to persuade the court that the subrule should not operate according to its terms. Subrule (2), by contrast, operates with respect to all proceedings (save those excluded by subrule (3)), even those in which the successful party has been awarded a judgment for more than $100,000. In such a case, it lies upon the party seeking to avoid the normal application of the Federal Court costs scales to persuade the court that the proceeding "could more suitably have been brought in another court or in a tribunal".  30 In Axe , Finkelstein J considered that r 36A(1) reflected two different but related principles. His Honour said ([2006] FCA 844 at [4]- [5]):
 In my opinion the rule reflects at least two different but related principles. The first is that is it essential to keep down the costs of a small claim. Unless this principle is invoked the costs of small claims will often (perhaps more often than not) exceed the quantum of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1827">10 The respondent, which vigorously prosecuted a cross-claim for revocation of Black &amp; Decker's patents and design, can hardly complain that the present proceeding was commenced in a "prescribed court", being the only court in which a revocation proceeding could be brought: Patents Act s 138 ; see LED Builders Pty Ltd v Hope [1994] FCA 1353 ; (1994) 53 FCR 10 at [17] ; Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1371 ; (2004) 64 IPR 57 at [8] - [9] ; Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788 at [203] ; Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 844 at [6] ; Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 34 ; (2006) 227 ALR 287 at [32] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 896">13 I see no reason not to apply that principle in this case. Accordingly, I will order that the costs ordered to be paid, including disbursements, not be reduced by one-third under O 62 r 36A(1), for the nature of the claim being one appropriately brought in the Federal Court is "good reason" to depart from that rule: Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 844 at [6] per Finkelstein J. It also follows that there is no scope for the application of O 62 r 36A(2).</sentence>
