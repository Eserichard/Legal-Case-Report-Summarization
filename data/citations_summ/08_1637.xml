<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 65">53 There is nothing in the facts of this case or the authorities to support the contention that because the CFMEU was vicariously liable for the unlawful conduct, the principles of general deterrence are inapplicable: see, for example, Alfred v Wakelin (No. 1) [2008] FCA 1455 at [38] and [40] (CFMEU found liable by reason of s 69 of the BCII Act for the conduct of its job delegate); Cruse v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No. 2) [2008] FCA 1637 at [9] (CFMEU found vicariously liable for conduct of shop steward); Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No. 4) [2009] FCA 1040 ; (2009) 189 IR 304 at [76] , [86], [93] and [97]; John Holland Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No. 2) [2009] FCA 865 ; (2009) 187 IR 400 at [96] (CFMEU found vicariously liable for conduct of its organisers).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 865">To similar effect are Hadgkiss v CFMEU (No 3) [2007] FCA 87 ; (2007) 160 IR 263 (the substantive proceeding); Hadgkiss v CFMEU (No 4) [2007] FCA 425 ; (2007) 161 IR 338 (a penalty proceeding); Hadgkiss v CFMEU (No 5) [2008] FCA 1040 ; (2008) 178 IR 123 (a penalty proceeding) and CFMEU v Hadgkiss (No 2) [2009] FCAFC 17 ; (2009) 174 FCR 237. Reliance is placed on Inspector Cruse v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1267 ; (2008) 175 IR 447 (the substantive proceeding) and Cruse v CFMEU (No 2) [2008] FCA 1637 (the penalty proceeding) as an example of contraventions of ss 298SC and 170NC of the Act by the CFMEU. The Union was vicariously liable for the conduct of its delegate, Mr Fry. The conduct involved Mr Fry falsely telling a self-employed building contractor engaged to do work on a building site that he was required to join the CFMEU (the s 298SC breach) and falsely telling the contractor that he was required to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement (the s 170NC breach). </sentence>
