<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1404">It is clear that Australian Medic-Care may only apply for the order it seeks if it had not received the notice of the estimate (O 62 r 46(3)(cb) and see Cytel Pty Ltd v Peoplebank Recruitment Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 518). It is also clear that it carries the onus of establishing that the notice was not received. There is no evidence that the notice of estimate was not received at Australian Medic-Care's address for service. In fact the probability is that it was. Service has been effected in accordance with the Federal Court Rules (see Order 7) and Australian Medic-Care has failed to establish that it did not receive the notice of estimate. Under the relevant rule I do not have a discretion to make the order which Australian Medic-Care seeks. In those circumstances, the notice of motion must be dismissed. I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko. Associate:

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1554">1 This appeal is from a decision of a Federal Magistrate dismissing the appellant's application to set aside a bankruptcy notice: Rana v Chief of Army [2008] FCA 518. For present purposes, the appeal presently raises the short point whether, under s 60(4) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (the Act), the appellant can maintain the appeal. It arises because, after the appeal was instituted, the appellant became bankrupt on 13 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1449">14 In circumstances where the party who is required to pay has not received the estimate, the paying party may apply to the Court for an order to set aside the certificate of taxation: O 62 r 46(3)(cb) FCR. However, where costs remain unpaid for a period of 14 days after service of a certificate of taxation, the registrar shall at the request of the party in whose favour the costs are awarded, draw up, sign and seal an order in favour of that party for the sum shown in the certificate of taxation and enter the same: O 62 r 45(3) FCR. That award carries interest from the date of the certificate: O 62 r 45(6) and (7) FCR. From these provisions it can be seen that in circumstances where a litigant receives a copy of the estimate it is not open under O 62 r 46(3)(cb) FCR to set aside the certificate of taxation or any order which is based upon it: Cytel Pty Ltd v Peoplebank Recruitment Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 518 at [12] . There is, however, procedural fairness provided at the earlier stage, in the sense that there is a right to object on receipt of the estimate within a period of 21 days after the estimate pursuant to O 62 r 46(3)(c) FCR and failing receipt of notification of the estimate there is a right to apply to set aside the certificate of taxation under O 62 r 46(3)(cb) FCR. The purpose of the service of the certificate of taxation is to allow the paying party 14 days within which to pay the costs as assessed. An order under O 62 r 45(3) FCR for payment of the costs as certified involves no exercise of discretion. It is a mandatory procedure. The receiving party is entitled as of right to the order once the costs remained unpaid for 14 days after service of the certificate.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 697">1 On 22 April 2008 I delivered judgment in Cytel Pty Ltd v Peoplebank Recruitment Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 518 , pursuant to a notice of motion filed by Cytel ('the notice of motion'). Cytel sought orders, inter alia, that a costs order against it be set aside and that it be granted time to file a notice of objection to a bill of costs issued against it. The notice of motion was dismissed and Cytel was ordered to pay Peoplebank's costs on an indemnity basis. </sentence>
