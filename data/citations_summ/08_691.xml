<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 318">It should be noted that subsequently, Finn J struck out the amended statement of claim on the basis that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (ACN 064 829 616) (No 2) [2008] FCA 691. Referring to the motion filed by the respondents, Finn J declined to order summary dismissal of the proceedings pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court Act. His Honour observed, at [1], that "while the pleading is misguided in its thrust, it cannot be said that the underlying complaint that appears to inform it may not suggest a reasonable cause of action". His Honour, at [19] also pointed to the fact that Mr Kowalski was unrepresented and "cannot be expected fully to understand the mysteries of the law of trusts". In the circumstances Finn J held that "it is proper for the court to endeavour within appropriate limits to ascertain the right that confusedly such a litigant could well be seeking to assert". For that reason his Honour gave Mr Kowalski "one last opportunity" to file and serve a further amended application and statement of claim".  Ms Bochner also provided "a chronological summary of the corresponding Federal Court decisions in relation to proceedings instituted by the Respondent". She lists 33 decisions in respect of which written reasons were given. I have added another decision (number 34) that was relied upon by the applicants and discussed in their submissions although not listed in Ms Bochner's affidavit. The citations for those decisions and other relevant details are as follows: Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd (1998) FCR 55 , SG 100 of 1997, 16 October 1998; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1153 , SAD 190 of 2001, 17 September 2002; Kowalski v Trustee of Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 14 , SAD 234 of 2002, 15 January 2003; Kowalski v Trustee, Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 18 , SAD 234 of 2002, 28 February 2003; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1069 , (2000) 242 ALR 370 SAD 11 of 2007, 24 July 2007; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 691 , SAD 11 of 2007, 20 May 2008; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2008] FCA 1873 , SAD 171 of 2008, 4 December 2008; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1970 , SAD 168 of 2008, 22 December 2008; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 47 , SAD 216 of 2008, 30 January 2009; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 48 , SAD 205 of 2008, 3 February 2009; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 153 , SAD 3 of 2009, 27 February 2009; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 , SAD 168 of 2008, 30 July 2009; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCAFC 107, (2009) 259 ALR 444 ; SAD 26 of 2009, 14 August 2009; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 , SAD 171 of 2008, 3 September 2009; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 117 , (2009) 259 ALR 319 ; SAD 20 of 2009, 9 September 2009; Kowalski v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2009] FCA 1044 , SAD 75 of 2009, 17 September 2009; Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia [2009] FCA 1072 , SAD 81 of 2009, 23 September 2009; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 1289 , SAD 133 of 2009, 9 November 2009; Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia [2009] FCA 1420 , SAD 165 of 2009, 2 December 2009; </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1170">On two occasions Finn J refused to summarily dismiss this application, and gave the applicant leave to file and serve an amended application and statement of claim: see Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1069 ; (2007) 242 ALR 370 and Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 691. On a third occasion, 5 February 2009, his Honour struck out the applicant's further amended statement of claim, and the proceeding was summarily dismissed pursuant to s 31A of the FCA Act. His Honour found that the applicant's claim that a benefit should have been paid to him on the cessation of his employment in 1994 had no reasonable prospects of success on the basis that no formal application was made to the Trustee at that time and there was no evidence that the Trustee was informed of, or provided with, any medical evidence as to his entitlement. In relation to the claim that the Trustee should have considered his entitlement to a benefit in November 1998, his Honour found that there were also no reasonable prospects of success as again no formal application was made to the Trustee at that time. In relation to the Trustee's treatment of his application for the benefit in 2005, his Honour held that it also enjoyed no reasonable prospects of success as it was clear that the Trustee had considered and reconsidered his claim on a number of occasions between 1999 and 2005, and the Trustee was entitled to decline to re-entertain the same matter in the absence of a change of circumstances. His Honour further found that none of the breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty claims raised by the applicant had any reasonable prospects of success: see Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 53. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCAFC 117">13 Mr Kowalski availed himself of the leave granted by the primary judge to file and serve an amended application and statement of claim. Thereupon, the respondents moved for orders that either the proceedings be summarily dismissed pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Federal Court Act') or that the amended statement of claim be struck out under Order 11 rule 16 of the Federal Court Rules as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. By his judgement handed down on 20 May 2008 ( Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (ACN 064 829 616) [2008] FCA 691 ('Kowalski No 2')) the primary judge ordered that the amended statement of claim be struck out and granted leave to Mr Kowalski to file and serve a further amended application and further amended statement of claim. In his reasons for judgment the primary judge said at [1]:
 '1 The motion before me is a predictable sequel to the circumscribed leave I gave Mr Kowalski in Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (2007) 242 ALR 370 to file and serve an amended application and statement of claim. ... I intend to take the latter course [striking out the amended statement of claim under Order 11 rule 16 of the Federal Court Rules ] for the reason that, while the pleading is misguided in its thrust, it cannot be said that the underlying complaint that appears to inform it may not suggest a reasonable cause of action. In their submissions the respondents, while not admitting this to be the case, have come close to identifying that cause of action, though without conceding that it is reasonably arguable or that they do not have a good defence to it. '  


 
59 The primary judge commenced his reasons for judgment of 5 February 2009 by saying:
 '1 On two previous occasions I have refused summarily to dismiss Mr Kowalski's application and gave him leave to file and serve an amended application and statement of claim: see Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1069 ; (2007) 242 ALR 370 and Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 691. On the latter occasion I indicated that I was providing him with his last opportunity to provide an intelligible and unobjectionable pleading. I have, though with little optimism, recommended to him that he obtain competent legal assistance. He has to date demonstrated little understanding both of the law he seeks to invoke in his own favour and of how to present, albeit in lay form, a clear statement of the claim he seeks to prosecute. My recommendation was not accepted. As he has done in so many proceedings in this Court and in other courts and tribunals concerning his relationship with his past employer, Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd (MMAL), he acted without legal representation on the motion presently before me. That motion, brought by the two respondents, again seeks the summary dismissal of the proceeding pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) or else under O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules . 2 I intend to make a summary order under s 31A giving judgment for the respondents in relation to the whole proceeding.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 332">The application of O 11 r 16 should now be considered in the light of the principles discussed in relation to s 31A: see Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ACN 123 123 124) v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers) [2006] FCA 1416 at [11], namely that a proceeding need not be hopeless or bound to fail before the Court can strike out a pleading or part of a pleading. In deciding whether to strike out, the Court must have regard to the adequacy of the pleading and must take the evidence at its highest. That is, the Court must assess the pleadings as if the facts alleged are true: see ACCC v Alice Car &amp; Truck Rentals Pty Ltd (unreported, O'Loughlin J, 5 March 1997). The Court should err on the side of striking out rather than giving summary judgment where the underlying complaint of a pleading supports a reasonable cause of action, although the pleading itself has deficiencies: see Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 691 at [1] . ISSUES NOW AGREED 
 Quantum of Pecuniary relief

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 53">On two previous occasions I have refused summarily to dismiss Mr Kowalski's application and gave him leave to file and serve an amended application and statement of claim: see Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1069 ; (2007) 242 ALR 370 and Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 691. On the latter occasion I indicated that I was providing him with his last opportunity to provide an intelligible and unobjectionable pleading. I have, though with little optimism, recommended to him that he obtain competent legal assistance. He has to date demonstrated little understanding both of the law he seeks to invoke in his own favour and of how to present, albeit in lay form, a clear statement of the claim he seeks to prosecute. My recommendation was not accepted. As he has done in so many proceedings in this Court and in other courts and tribunals concerning his relationship with his past employer, Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd (MMAL), he acted without legal representation on the motion presently before me. That motion, brought by the two respondents, again seeks the summary dismissal of the proceeding pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) or else under O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules . </sentence>
