<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 2043">These orders have already been considered by Sackville J in the application for leave to appeal heard on 9 th October 2007. The applicant's arguments about the costs order of 10 August 2007 were considered by Sackville J in the application for leave to appeal, where his Honour said In view of the dismissal of the applications for leave to appeal against the substantive orders in Judgments No 1 and No 2, I do not think it appropriate to grant leave to appeal solely against the costs order made by the Federal Magistrate in the summary dismissal proceedings. If the applicant ultimately fails in the proceedings, he will be entitled to appeal as of right. Such an appeal may provide the applicant with the opportunity to challenge the Federal Magistrate's order that he pay Telstra's costs of the summary dismissal application. [9]  This matter was canvassed at the hearing of the application for leave to appeal before Sackville J on 9 th October 2007. His Honour dealt with that very issue in his judgment at [36] --- [38]. [8]  What Justice Sackville actually said is, In my view, the applicant has an arguable case that, having regard to the real prospect that he had been misled by the description of the investigation as 'independent' (as the Federal Magistrate appears to have found), his Honour should have concluded that the interests of justice justified the Court restraining the solicitors from acting in the proceedings against the applicant. However, I am not satisfied that substantial injustice would be caused to the applicant if leave to appeal is refused. There is no plausible suggestion that the solicitors acquired any information adverse to the applicant in consequence of the investigation, let alone any confidential information. [14] </sentence>
