<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] AATA 702">In Wilton &amp; Cumberland v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd , [118] Conti J considered the description " casual employee ":
 
" 103 The applicants acknowledged that the term 'casual employee' has no fixed meaning, citing Doyle v Sydney Steel Company Ltd [1936] HCA 66 ; (1936) 56 CLR 545 at 551, where Starke J provided the following description of the term: 
 
 ' The description "casual worker" is not one of precision: it is a colloquial expression, and where, upon all the facts, there is a reasonably debatable question whether the work is casual or regular, the question is one of fact for the commission. ' " [119]

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] SAIRC 20">6/2004 . There is no foundation for this approach. [21] I agree with the respondent's submission that there is no need to imply a term into the contract in relation to overtime. The hours per fortnight were no more than 76 hours on average meaning that the cycle of hours was such that on average Daniels did not exceed 38 hours per week of work. As I have found the Award has no application to the duties performed by Daniels.</sentence>
