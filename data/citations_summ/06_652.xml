<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 697">Order 35 rule 7 of the Federal Court Rules permits the Court to set aside an order before it is entered (r 7(1)), where it is interlocutory (r 7(2)(c)) or where it is an injunction (r 7(2)(d)). However it is equally clear that such a step requires careful consideration. A number of principles relevant to an application of this nature were conveniently summarised by Young J in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 2) [2006] FCA 652 in the following terms: 
 
 4 The first issue which arises concerns the application to discharge the injunctive order made on 19 May 2006. There is a preliminary question as to the circumstances that must be demonstrated before a court would consider varying or discharging an interlocutory injunction. Under O 35 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules , the Court has power to vary or set aside an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] VSC 60">43 When an application is made to discharge or vary an injunction, the authorities make it clear that circumstances must be demonstrated that make it appropriate to entertain the application. In Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure [5] Young J conveniently summarised the authorities. His Honour said, 
 
 
 The authorities indicate that the kind of exceptional circumstances that might attract the power of discharge or variation include where an interlocutory order was obtained by fraud or non-disclosure of material facts, or through an accident or mistake that occurred without the fault of the parties seeking the relief under O 35 r 7: see Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 at 549---551. The court's discretion to vary or set aside an order is to be exercised with great caution having regard to the importance of the public interest in the finality of litigation: Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc (1981) 148 CLR 170 ('Brown') at 178; Baker v Beckett (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, Cohen J, 26 May 1998) ('Baker'); and Chanel Ltd v FW Woolworth &amp; Co Ltd [1981] 1 All ER 745 ('Chanel') at 751. Similar principles apply to the variation or discharge of final orders: see Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) (1993) 176 CLR 300 ('Autodesk') at 302, 307, 309---310, 317---318 and 321. Further, as Spender J emphasised in Dudzinski in relation to O 35 r 7(2)(c), the rule is not an alternative to the appellate procedure in respect of interlocutory judgments, nor is it to be invoked for the purpose of allowing a party to present a case a second time to its better advantage. In my opinion, these principles apply, a fortiori, where the party applying for discharge of an interlocutory order seeks to reargue the issues that have already been determined by reference to additional evidence that was available to it on the earlier occasion but which it chose not to advance: see also Autodesk at 310 per Brennan J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 745">1 On 26 May 2006, I dismissed a notice of motion dated 25 May 2006 by which the respondents sought orders discharging or staying an interlocutory injunction which I granted in these proceedings on 19 May 2006: Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 2) [2006] FCA 652. I reserved the costs of the motion pending receipt of written submissions as to whether costs can or should be ordered in favour of the applicant, having regard to the provisions of s 824 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('WRA').</sentence>
