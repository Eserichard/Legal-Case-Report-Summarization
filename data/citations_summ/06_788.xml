<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 1305">
 The Tribunal ignored the overall 81.8 % attendance rate 
 The Tribunal's statement of reasons makes it very clear that the Tribunal was aware of the University of Newcastle's' re-calculation (taking into account medical certificates received from the applicant) of an overall 81.8% attendance rate: CB 122.5, 123.6. However, the clear terms of condition 8202(3)(a) compelled the Tribunal to be satisfied that there was an attendance rate of 80% or above for each term or semester of the relevant course: CB 123.6. [15] 
 It is clear that the Tribunal was aware of the overall attendance rate and took this into account. However on the material before it was compelled to its finding that it did not satisfy the terms of condition 8202(3)(a). That is because the applicant 'did not attend 80% of his scheduled contact hours in terms 8 and 9 in 2005 and term 1 of 2006'.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 697">12 He claimed three jurisdictional errors on the part of the Tribunal:
 
 (1) that the Tribunal took into account the applicant's academic progress for the autumn semester (February to June 2000) when much of that period fell outside the period of the 2000 visa --- the Federal Magistrate followed the decision of Siopis J in Kang v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 788 at [29] where his Honour said: 
 
 
 The Regulations prescribe the means by which a visa holder is to satisfy the requirement of Condition 8202 in respect of academic performance. It is by a visa holder obtaining a certificate from the education provider that the academic result is 'at least satisfactory' in respect of each term or semester as the case may be. There is no qualification in the Regulations specifying the period of time that the visa holder was required to have held a specific visa prior to the end of the relevant term or semester. Satisfaction of the visa condition simply requires the production of a certificate in relation to the academic performance for the term or semester in question and contemplates that the certificate will be issued at the end of the term or semester. The means of fulfilling the requirement is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the case of a person who is a student for the whole of the semester or term but whose visa expires during the term or semester and is issued a new visa during that term. There is no dispute in this case that the applicant was enrolled at the commencement of the semester in question and was a student for the whole of the semester. 
 
 
 
 (2) that the Tribunal failed to take into account that in the period between February and June 2000 (the first semester of 2000) he had not received any warning from the University that his academic progress was unsatisfactory, and that the absence of such warning was relevant to whether he had substantially completed with Condition 8202 --- the Federal Magistrate said simply that the Tribunal had not erred in concluding that there was a failure to comply with Condition 8202 on the basis of the information provided by the University. In fact, it noted that the Tribunal, before issuing the certificate of unsatisfactory academic progress, had information as to the illness of the appellant's wife and as to the illness and subsequent death of his father, but it had said that "these events do not explain the sustained failure to meet academic requirements from the autumn term of 2000";
 (3) that the Tribunal had failed to have regard to the former terms of Condition 8202 in respect of the period between June and December 2000 when academic performance and attendance were alternative rather than cumulative requirements imposed by Condition 8202 --- the Federal Magistrate rejected that submission on the basis of decisions of this Court, principally of the Full Court (Madgwick Gyles and Conti JJ) in Siddique v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 16. </sentence>

This is a matter which was raised before Siopis J in Kang v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 788 where at [29]:
 
 
 "The Regulations prescribe the means by which a visa holder is to satisfy the requirement of Condition 8202 in respect of academic performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] MRTA 56">Satisfaction of the visa condition simply requires the production of a certificate in relation to the academic performance for the term or semester in question and contemplates that the certificate will be issued at the end of the term or semester: Kang v MIMIA [2006] FCA 788 (Siopis J, 23 June 2006) at [29].</sentence>
