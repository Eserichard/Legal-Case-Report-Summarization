<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 334">I do not propose to make such an order. Entirity's claim had federal elements, namely the claim under the Copyright Act and the alleged contravention of the Corporations Act (both could have been prosecuted in the Federal Magistrates Court though that would be directly relevant to sub rule (2) rather than (1)). There is a line of authority discussed by Jessup J in Nokia Corporation v Liu [2009] FCA 20 that in copyright infringement proceedings, full costs can nonetheless be recovered even if the judgement amount was less than $100,000. However, in the present case, I think it can be fairly said that Entirity's copyright case certainly was not central to its claims and it can probably be said that it was pursued with a degree of comparative indifference. In any event, its infringement claim failed completely.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 986">Accordingly, I am not satisfied that any damages are payable to the applicants in respect of those 20 programs pursuant to s.115(2) of the Act (see Nokia Corporation v Liu [2009] FCA 20 at [19] per Jessup J). Additional damages
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1058">His Honour further stated that "[i]n my opinion, the operation of subr (1) is not triggered by the simple grant of final declaratory relief ". His Honour, as has subsequently been held, " said nothing about the situation ... where damages, declarations and injunctions were sought, but where the only final relied awarded ... is by way of a money judgment ": Shahid v Australasian College of Dermatologists (No 2) [2008] FCAFC 98 at [14] . The Rule is not excluded where damages are sought together with declaratory or injunctive relief: Nokia Corporation v Liu [2009] FCA 20 at [32] , [2009] FCA 20 ; 80 IPR 286 at 298 per Jessup J. Rule 36A, it is considered, has no application where the only substantive relief that is granted is declaratory and injunctive relief and where any claim for monetary relief is not pursued. </sentence>
