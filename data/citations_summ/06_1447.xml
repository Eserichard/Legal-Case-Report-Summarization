<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 942">118 In June 2006 the defendant applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for an order staying the decision of the SSAT. The AAT dismissed the application ( Re Croker and Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] AATA 536). This proceeding is not relied upon by the plaintiff as a vexatious proceeding. In September 2008 the defendant appealed to the Federal Court, pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). Upon being satisfied that there was no error of law, Buchanan J dismissed the application with costs ( Croker v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1257). In October 2006 the defendant sought leave to appeal from the decision of Buchanan J. Gyles J found that there was no reason to doubt the correctness of the decision of Buchanan J and dismissed the appeal with costs ( Croker v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1447). </sentence>
