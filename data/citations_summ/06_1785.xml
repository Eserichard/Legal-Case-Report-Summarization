<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 672">1 On 20 December 2006 I published my reasons for concluding that the defendant should be found guilty on three charges of contempt (see Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Pappas [2006] FCA 1785]). The present reasons should be understood in the light of and as an extension of those reasons. On 20 December 2006, I gave directions for the parties to make submissions on the appropriate penalty for contempt. I have now received written submissions on behalf of the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (the Commission) and the defendant and have heard oral submissions on behalf of both parties on that question. </sentence>
