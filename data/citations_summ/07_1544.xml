<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWCA 104">126 The test is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind " to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide ": Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48 ; 201 CLR 488 at 492-493 [11] , [12], per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; see also Re JRL; Ex parte CJL [1986] HCA 39 ; 161 CLR 342 , at 352, per Mason J. The fair-minded lay observer would not consider that the determination by Simpson J of a narrow question of law against the applicant might create a reasonable apprehension that she might be unable to bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the quite different issues presented by the University's application: cf Sydney Refractive Surgery Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1544 , at [23], per Sackville J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1903">25 An alternative ground for the conclusion that I should not disqualify myself from hearing the present application on the ground of apparent bias is this. The test for apparent bias is well-known and it is "whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide": Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48 ; (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 492 [11] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. In this case, if there is apparent bias, it takes the form of prejudgment. That form of bias was considered by the High Court in Livesey v The New South Wales Bar Association [1983] HCA 17 ; (1983) 151 CLR 288. In assessing that form of apparent bias in this case, the nature of the respondents' application is important. The respondents' application is not one in which I was called upon to make findings as to credit or, indeed, to make any findings of fact. The applicant's allegations of fact may be accepted for the purposes of the respondents' application. The questions raised by the respondents' application are, in substance, questions of law, and, having regard to all the circumstances, I do not think it can be said that a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that I might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the question I am required to decide: Sydney Refractive Surgery Centre Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1544 ; (2007) 68 ATR 19 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Taylor [2008] VSC 3. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 454">7 Although SRSC is the applicant, the proceedings in this Court were initially conducted on its behalf by solicitors acting on instructions from two of the three defendants in the defamation proceedings, HSV Channel Seven Pty Ltd (' HSV ') and Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd ' ATS ') (together ' Seven '): see Sydney Refractive Surgery Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1544 , at [10]. Seven took on this role, notwithstanding that neither HSV nor ATS is a party to the current proceedings, apparently because the orders made by Studdert J in the defamation proceedings contemplate that SRSC can apply for an increase in the damages award if it is found liable to pay capital gains tax in respect of the Sum. </sentence>
