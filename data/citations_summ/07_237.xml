<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 790">Following an appeal by Mr Wiegand to the Federal Court of Australia against the Tribunal's decision of 12 August 2005, the Court (Finn J), on 27 November 2006, dismissed the appeal: see Wiegand v Comcare Australia [2006] FCA 1620. On 16 February 2007, however, Finn J, pursuant to O 35 r 7(1) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth), set aside his judgment in Wiegand v Comcare Australia [2006] FCA 1620 , allowed Mr Wiegand's appeal, set aside the Tribunal's decision of 12 August 2005, and remitted the matter to the Tribunal "to be decided again": see Wiegand v Comcare (No 2) [2007] FCA 237 ; (2007) 94 ALD 154.  The phrase "as a result of" in the definition of "injury" in s 4(1) of the SRC Act involves causation: it requires that there be a causal relationship between the "reasonable disciplinary action", or the "failure ... to obtain a promotion, transfer or benefit", (as the case may be) and the contraction of the relevant "disease": Kooragang Cement Pty Ltd v Bates (1994) 35 NSWLR 452 at 463---464; Ilsley v Wattyl Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 75 FCR 1 at 6; Woodward v Repatriation Commission (2003) 131 FCR 473 at 488. Although that phrase, in terms, is not qualified and does not expressly impose an "evaluative threshold below which a causal connection may be disregarded" ( Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 at 249---250), it is clear that the required causal connection will be present where the "reasonable disciplinary action" or the "failure ... to obtain a promotion, transfer or benefit" (as the case may be) "materially contributed to" the contraction of the relevant "disease": Hart v Comcare [2005] FCAFC 16 ; (2005) 145 FCR 29 at 33. More recently, however, in Comcare v Caldwell [2008] FCA 2015 Perram J observed (at para 5): 
 
 "... The necessity for the disciplinary process to contribute to the injury in a material degree in order to be excluded from the definition of 'injury' was established by this Court's decision in Weigand (sic) v Comcare Australia (No 2) [2007] FCA 237 ; (2007) 94 ALD 154. "

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 396">What amounts to a material contribution has been considered by the courts in the context of the pre-2007 amendments to the Act relating to the meaning of ' in a material degree ' in the former section 4(1). [11] Following the amendments to the Act in 2007 referred to earlier, a material contribution must be more than de minimis . [12] However, the ' as a result of ' test in the proviso to section 5A(1) is less demanding than the ' substantially more than materia l' (emphasis added) test of what is contribution to a ' significant degree ' (section 5B). Quantifying these distinctions is a question of fact and degree in each case.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] AATA 38">What amounts to a material contribution has been considered by the courts in the context of the pre-2007 amendments relating to the meaning of 'in a material degree' in the former section 4(1) of the Act. [51] Following the amendments to the Act in 2007 referred to earlier, a material contribution must be a significant contribution. [52] Significant means material and more than de minimis . However, the 'as a result of' test in the proviso to section 5A(1) is less demanding than the ' substantially more than material' (emphasis added) test of what is contribution to a 'significant degree' (section 5B). Quantifying these distinctions is a question of fact and degree in each case.  Unlike other cases in which distinct operative causes occurred at different times, the causes in this case are inextricably linked and their impact occurred simultaneously. [29] Accordingly, it is artificial to attempt to separate out the content of the allegations from the actions of ACT Health in accepting the claims and taking action on them. As Martin CJ noted in Swanson v Northern Territory [30] , in a matter on comparable facts that applied legislation based on the Commonwealth Act: 
 
 No doubt the fact of the allegations [by some of Mr Swanson's pupils] operated on the mind of the appellant and could be regarded as a "cause" of his injury. However, the summoning [of Mr Swanson by the principal] and imparting of the information was also a cause and the injury was "a result of" that reasonable administrative action. The effect or consequence of the summoning and imparting of the information was the suffering of the injury. [31]

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 2015">This provision made it forensically desirable for Comcare to seek to prove that Mr Caldwell's psychological issues were caused by disciplinary action rather than the electrical accident. In response, Mr Caldwell contended that the disciplinary process to which he had been subjected had not contributed to his condition in a material way. The necessity for the disciplinary process to contribute to the injury in a material degree in order to be excluded from the definition of "injury" was established by this Court's decision in Weigand v Comcare Australia (No 2) [2007] FCA 237 ; (2007) 94 ALD 154. The medical evidence before the Tribunal on the question of whether the disciplinary action had contributed to his condition in a material degree was varied. That variation was a function, in part, of obscurity in the expert evidence about when precisely it was that the disciplinary action had commenced. The Tribunal concluded that the disciplinary process commenced on 30 May 2002 when the formal letter was sent. It also concluded, however, that it had not contributed to Mr Caldwell's condition in a material degree. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] AATA 897">If the direction can be characterised in that way, then cases would indicate ( Hart v Comcare [2005] FCAFC 16 ; (2005) 145 FCR 29 and Weigand v Comcare (No 2) [2007] FCA 237 ; (2007) 94 ALD 154) that if the failure to obtain the transfer or benefit materially contributed to the injury, then even if there were other causative factors contributing to the injury, the exclusion will operate. Those cases rejected a previous line of authority which suggested that the exclusion would not operate where the injury was attributable to several causes and not just to the failure to obtain a transfer or benefit. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] AATA 1180">We refer to the decision of the Federal Court in Weigand v Comcare (No 2) (2007) FCA 237.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] AATA 450">However for the exclusionary provisions of the definition of "injury" to apply we must be satisfied that the disciplinary action contributed to Mr Caldwell's illness "in a material degree". Weigand v Comcare Australia (No 2) [2007] FCA 237. In this decision the Federal Court applied the "more demanding requirement of contribution than had conventionally been considered to be the case''. The Court had applied this requirement in relation to the definition of "disease" in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] AATA 1250">There are inconsistent decisions of the Federal Court as to the causal connection that is required between employment and a disease in order for a disease to be compensable under the SRC Act. In two cases decided by single Judges, namely Suters v Australian Postal Corporation (1992) 28 ALD 320 and Wiegand v Comcare Australia [2002] FCA 1464 ; (2002) 72 ALD 795 , the Court applied the approach adopted in an earlier case, namely Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission [1990] FCA 511 ; (1990) 26 FCR 316 , which had been decided under the predecessor of the SRC Act. In Treloar a Full Court of the Federal Court said in effect that the use of the word "material" in other cases in conjunction with the words "contributing factor" (being the expression used in the predecessor legislation) in explaining the relevant section was merely to emphasise that the section was not brought into play unless it was established that the employment did in fact contribute to the condition complained of; and once the causal link was established, it did not matter whether the contribution was large or small. However, in dicta in a much later Full Court decision, namely Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 , French and Stone JJ, who constituted the majority in the Full Court, said in effect that the word "material" in the test of causation in the definition of "disease" in the SRC Act required that the contribution from employment had to be more than a mere contributing factor. The High Court allowed an appeal from the Full Federal Court, but the High Court did not comment on the dicta as to the relevance of the words "to a material degree" in the context of the definition of disease. The views of French and Stone JJ as to this aspect were later adopted by Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 and Wiegand v Comcare Australia (No. 2) [2007] FCA 237. </sentence>
