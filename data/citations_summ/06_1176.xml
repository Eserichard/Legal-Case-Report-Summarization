<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] APO 37">In Pfizer Corp v Commissioner of Patents (No 2) [2006] FCA 1176 , 69 IPR 525 Bennett J considered the expression "the date of commencement of the first inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods of goods that contain, or consist of, the substance" as it occurs in section 70(5)(a). The fact situation in that case was that goods had been first entered on the ARTG as "listed goods" for export only, and subsequently entered as "registered goods" for marketing in Australia. Her Honour concluded at [32] that section 70(5)(a) should be given its plain meaning, and the relevant date was the date of "the entry, first in time, in a part of the ARTG". On appeal ( Pfizer Corp v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCAFC 190 , 238 ALR 519) , the Full Court came to the same view, stating at [57]:
 
"As a matter of ordinary English, 'first inclusion in' the Therapeutic Register means the first time when goods are included in the Therapeutic Register pursuant to Division 2 of Part 3 - 2 , irrespective of the part of the Therapeutic Register in which they are included. "
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] APO 31">A patentee may apply for an extension of term within six months of the date of commencement of the first inclusion in the ARTG of relevant goods (see subsection 71(2)). The application must be accepted by the Commissioner if satisfied that the requirements of sections 70 and 71 have been met (subsection 74(1)). The application is then advertised in the Official Journal, and a person may oppose the extension of term (subsection 75(1)). If the Commissioner grants the extension of term, the term of the extension is calculated according to section 77. In Pfizer Corp v Commissioner of Patents (No 2) [2006] FCA 1176 at [34] , [2006] FCA 1176 ; (2006) 69 IPR 525 at 530 ( Pfizer No 2 ), the Federal Court stated that section 77 is based on the earliest of the first regulatory approval dates that apply to the patent:
 
"Section 77 refers to the ' earliest first regulatory approval date' (emphasis added). This recognises that the patent may cover more than one pharmaceutical substance and provides that the term of the extension is based on the earliest of the approval dates that apply to the patent. "
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 559">(In H Lundbeck A/S v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 163 , I held that reg 10.7(7) was intra vires s 228 of the Act. Bennett J followed me in Pfizer Corporation v Commissioner of Patents (No 2) [2006] FCA 1176 ; (2006) 69 IPR 525 , and on appeal from her Honour, the Full Court agreed with us: see Pfizer Corporation v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCAFC 190 ; (2006) 155 FCR 578. An application by Pfizer Corporation for special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused: see [2007] HCA Trans 93. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] APO 2">
 10. The provisions of Part 3 of Chapter 6 of the Act provide for the extension of term of standard patents relating to pharmaceutical substances. These provisions have now been considered in a number of decided cases and perhaps more relevantly for the current circumstances in H Lundbeck A/S v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 163 , in Pfizer Corp v Commissioner of Patents (No 2) [2006] FCA 1176 and on appeal to the full bench in Pfizer Corp v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCAFC 190. The latter also outlines in some detail the relevant provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Act .  22. On appeal to the Federal Court, Justice Bennett ( Pfizer Corp v Commissioner of Patents (No 2) [2006] FCA 1176) appears to have affirmed that interpretation, indicating that: 
 
 "34 Section 77 refers to the ' earliest first regulatory approval date ' (emphasis added). This recognises that the patent may cover more than one pharmaceutical substance and provides that the term of the extension is based on the earliest of the approval dates that apply to the patent.
