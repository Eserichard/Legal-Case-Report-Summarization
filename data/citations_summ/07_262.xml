7 In Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop.com.Limited [2007] FCA 567 Nicholson J declined again to strike out these proceedings for want of prosecution. His Honour referred to the more recent history of the proceedings to that date observing:
 
 
 2 The circumstances in which decision on the motion has been delayed have been set out in Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop.com.limited [2007] FCA 262 and in reasons published on 15 April 2005 - Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop.com Limited [2005] FCA 438. In addition I referred in Capital Webworks [2005] FCA 438 at [45] - [47] to reliance by the first and second respondents on FCR O 35A r 2(1)(f) and r 3 to support the stay or dismissal on the basis of failure to prosecute the proceeding with due diligence. 
 3 The first contention made by the first and second respondents in support of the motion for stay or dismissal was that the application was an abuse of process because it was unlawfully maintained and champertous, and so an abuse of process. 
 6 The applicant says that no application to strike out for want of prosecution has been made and none could have been made. Rather, it submits that the progress of the application has been delayed by the large number of interlocutory applications. Certainly it is apparent that as between 15 April 2005 and the present date the delay has been occasioned by the appeals considered in Capital Webworks [2007] FCA 262. 
 7 Further the applicant says that although it wishes to make some amendments to the statement of claim and subject to orders being made in relation to consequential amendments, directions for trial may now be made.  
 3 The first contention made by the first and second respondents in support of the motion for stay or dismissal was that the application was an abuse of process because it was unlawfully maintained and champertous, and so an abuse of process. Having reviewed those submissions I decided in Capital Webworks [2005] FCA 438 to order that the applicant file and serve an affidavit setting out in full the circumstances pertaining to the beneficial ownership of its cause of action. As set out in Capital Webworks [2007] FCA 262 , it was found on appeal that there was no evidentiary support for the making of such an order. Consequently, no further weight than that already given in Capital Webworks [2005] FCA 438 can be given to that issue arising from the submissions of the first and second respondents. 
 4 The second head relied upon by those respondents was a failure to give proper discovery.</sentence>
