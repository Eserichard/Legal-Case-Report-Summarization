<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 59">11 The question before the primary judge was whether the two properties were "intended to be occupied, and [were] capable of being occupied, as a residence or for residential accommodation" within par (b) of the definition of "residential premises". In holding that they were not capable of being so occupied, her Honour applied what she had said about par (b) in South Steyne Hotel Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 13 ; (2009) 71 ATR 228 ( South Steyne ) at [31]:
 With these [dictionary] meanings in mind it is not difficult to see why the full court [in Marana Holdings Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 307 ; (2004) 141 FCR 299] reached the conclusion that an element of permanent or long-term occupation was necessary before premises could be described as residential premises. As indicated above, however, the definition of "residential premises" in the GST Act now requires the term of the occupation or intended occupation to be disregarded. In my view, that leaves as necessary only the element of shelter and basic living facilities such as are provided by a bedroom and bathroom. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1594">The term "residential premises" was defined in s 195-1 of the GST Act to mean "land or a building occupied or intended to be occupied as a residence , and includes a floating home" [emphasis added]. The term "land" in this definition in conjunction with the notion of occupation or intended occupation as a residence, has been held to mean land capable of providing some shelter and basic living facilities: South Steyne Hotel Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 13 ; (2009) 71 ATR 228 ; South Steyne Hotel Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCAFC 155. The notion inherent in the description "residential premises" was occupation as a residence or an intention to occupy as a residence. Section 40-35(1)(a) expressly excluded "commercial residential premises", from input tax treatment of residential premises. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1426">In South Steyne Hotel Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 13 ; (2009) 71 ATR 228 at [17] - [39] I gave detailed consideration to the GST Act definition of residential premises including the effect of the amendments made to the definition following the decision in Marana Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 307 ; (2004) 141 FCR 299. Following those amendments which added the reference to residential accommodation as well as the instruction to disregard the term of the occupation or intended occupation, I concluded, at [31], that "only the element of shelter and basic living facilities such as are provided by a bedroom and bathroom" were necessary. That conclusion was accepted by the Full Court in South Steyne Hotel Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCAFC 155 ; Emmett J (with whom Finn J agreed at [30], Edmonds J at [86]. The reference to bedroom and bathroom in the above comment was given as an example only; it does not limit the concept of shelter and basic living facilities. Indeed it may well be that shelter and basic living facilities could exist without there being, in any conventional sense, a bedroom or a bathroom. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 395">The effect of the 2006 amendments was put succinctly by Stone J in South Steyne Hotel Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 13; (2009) 71 ATR 228; 2009 ATC 20-090 , where at [31] her Honour said: 
 
 ... the definition of "residential premises" in the GST Act now requires the term of the occupation or intended occupation to be disregarded. In my view, that leaves as necessary only the element of shelter and basic living facilities such as provided by a bedroom and bathroom.
