<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 769">These views were considered and approved by Jacobson J in Chameleon Mining NL v Murchison Metals Ltd [2009] FCA 137. Chameleon was a case in which the plaintiff sought to file experts' reports at a late stage in the proceedings. At [13] his Honour said in what the respondent here considers an echo of his own situation: "It seems to me that, applying those principles, I ought to refuse to grant leave for two principal reasons. First this case was commenced by statement of claim filed nearly 15 months ago. The allegations made in [81] have been known to all parties since then. Particulars were sought by the second defendant in March 2008 and the plaintiff responded by stating that "this is a matter of evidence". Notwithstanding this, no evidence was filed on the question of valuation by the former solicitors before their retainer was withdrawn in November 2008. " "[14] It seems to me that I am entitled to infer that a decision must have been taken by the former solicitors that expert evidence is not to be called on that issue, particularly in light of the fact that it is an alternative claim to the primary claim made in [81]. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] VSC 209">46 Mr Lindberg further contends that, in dealing with applications which would delay the trial of a proceeding, a judge is entitled to weigh in the balance the strain the litigation imposes on litigants, particularly if they are personal litigants rather than business corporations, the anxieties occasioned by facing new issues and the raising of false hopes. He submits that Courts now take into account the strain which litigation may place upon those involved and the natural desire of most litigants to be freed, as quickly as possible, from the anxiety, distraction and disruption which litigation causes. [21] Mr Lindberg refers to and relies on Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Limited, [22] Ketteman v Hansel Properties Limited, [23] Bomanite Pty Ltd v Slatex Corporation Australia Pty Ltd, [24] Micallef v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd, [25] Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd, [26] Winn v Brahe [27] and Chameleon Mining NL v Murchison Metal Ltd. [28] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 303">That passage from JL Holdings does not state and should not be taken as stating some general or universal proposition that a party is entitled to an adjournment so long as the opposing party is looked after by an award of costs. As many decisions since JL Holdings have stated, the "attainment of justice" is a goal that is not achieved without a proper consideration of the facts in any given case : Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1623 , [2]; Cassar v Hans Pet Constructions Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 1386 , [18]-[24]; Chameleon Mining NL v Murchison Metals Ltd [2009] FCA 137 , [9]-[15]; Finerty v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1136 , [29]---[31]; Smolle v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2008] FCA 1065 , [68]; Williams v Calivil Park Holsteins Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 31 , [20]-[21]. The basic premise was clearly enunciated by Lindgren J at [52] in Thoo v Kelly [2008] FCA 830 ; (2008) 169 FCR 470: 
The refusal of an adjournment may amount to a denial of procedural fairness if it is likely to deny a party a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [40] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ ( Bhardwaj ); Touma v Saparas [2000] NSWCA 11 at [27] ). The procedure that will satisfy the demands of procedural fairness may differ in order "to meet the particular exigencies of the case" ( Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 615 per Brennan J). As I stated in Ali v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1415 ; (2005) 41 AAR 410 at [27] :
 
 
Ultimately, each complaint of a failure to accord procedural fairness by reason of the refusal of an adjournment turns on its own facts. Whether an adjournment should be granted is a matter within the discretion of the trial Judge (or Tribunal), to be resolved according to the overall requirements of justice in the particular circumstances [citation omitted]. </sentence>
