31 Other cases decided recently in this Court show that these principles are regularly applied: see, e.g., Barrett Property Group Limited v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 (" Barrett ") at [3]-[5] per Gilmour J; Xat Ky v Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd (No 2 ) [2007] FCA 1785 at [12] - [13], [29] per Middleton J; Access for All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] per Collier J; Jainshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 per Besanko J; and Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] - [5] per Finn J. </sentence>

7 A perusal of other cases decided in this Court, including in recent times, shows that these principles are regularly applied. In particular, the Court may award indemnity costs in respect of misconduct that causes loss of time to the Court and to other parties: see Tetijo Holdings Ltd v Keeprite Australia Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 187 per French J, referred to with approval in Colgate-Palmolive at 233 and Ugly Tribe Co Pty Ltd v Sikola [2001] VSC 189 (" Ugly Tribe ") at [7] per Harper J. In Xat Ky v Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd (No 2 ) [2007] FCA 1785 , Middleton J awarded indemnity costs to prevent the plaintiffs being out of pocket where "there was a considerable loss of time, inconvenience to the parties and the Court, and a wilful disregard to established law in the attempts to re-open the case ... and in the application for a restraining order": see [12]-[13], [29]. </sentence>
