<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 796">The need for an application for security to be made promptly is a factor repeatedly referred to and endorsed: e.g., Crypta Fuels Pty Ltd v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd (1995) 19 ACSR 68 at 71 per Lehane J. See also: Lawrance v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 417 at [14] . Delay is an " important consideration ": Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1279 at [56] , [2006] FCA 1279 ; 155 FCR 181 at 202 per Jessup J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 580">As Jessup J said in Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1279 at [10] , whether a corporation "will be unable to pay" involves two considerations of its own. The first is the need to fix the time at which the applicant's inability, or apprehended inability, is notionally to be assessed. That, as von Doussa J said in Beach Petroleum, is an element which requires an opinion to be formed about the financial position of the applicant "at the time of judgment and immediately thereafter": at 205. The second consideration relates to the range of assets to which recourse might be had for the purpose of meeting an adverse costs order. For that purpose, Jessup J took account of those assets which might be immediately realised, together with those which could be realised in sufficient time to enable the applicant to comply with a costs order in the usual terms. I respectfully agree with that approach. For convenience, I will refer to the kind of assets Jessup J has identified as liquid assets. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWSC 1095">11 Delay is a matter to be taken into account in dealing with an application such as this. In Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1279 ; (2006) 155 FCR 181 at 203 [61] , Jessup J said it was accepted in the authorities that it is necessary to look not only at the delay as such but also at the reason for it and the things which the parties have done in the meantime. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 604">It is apparent that s 56 of the Federal Court Act confers a broader power to award security for costs than s 1335 of the Corporations Act . In Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 1279 ; (2006) 155 FCR 181 at [8] , Jessup J highlighted that s 1335(1) has three elements, each of which requires a particular approach by the Court. Those elements are: 
 (a) the standard involved in the phrase "if it appears by credible testimony that there is reason to believe";
 (b) the concept involved in the phrase "the corporation will be unable to pay"; and
 (c) the nature of the discretion given by the words "the court ... may ... require". 

The parties were content to approach the applications in this matter on the footing that they would be determined by reference to s 1335. It is convenient to address the various elements in order. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] WASC 81">13 The plaintiff relies on this statement of principles. This statement has been applied in subsequent cases: see, for example, Meni's Tailoring &amp; Alterations Pty Ltd v Jeanswest Corporation Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1108 ; Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1279 ; (2006) 155 FCR 181. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] TASSC 75">
 
 19 Mr Procter SC for the third parties referred to Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1279. There Jessup J said at par63: 
 
 
 "There is no shortage of instances of security being ordered notwithstanding a respondent's delay. Mr Anderson referred me to Crypta Fuels Pty Ltd v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd (1995) 19 ACSR 68 , and to January Force Pty Ltd v Trico Restaurants Australia Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1746 , in each of which case a judge of this court ordered security notwithstanding what appeared, on the face, to be considerable delay. In the latter case, Goldberg J said that 'delays should be considered by reference to whether the delay has occasioned any prejudice to the applicant': at [18]. ..." </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1078">26 The discretion to order security for costs is a very broad one: Lucas v Yorke (1983) 50 ALR 228. The authorities have identified a number of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion. I refer, by way of example, to the discussion by Beazley J in KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd [1995] FCA 76 ; (1995) 56 FCR 189 at 196-198, French J in Carey-Hazell v Getz Bros &amp; Co (Aust) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1334 at [28] , Hill J in Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1989) ATPR 40-972 and Jessup J in Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1279 ; (2006) 155 FCR 181 at 183-186 [7] - [12].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] FCA 1672">There is no evidence before me that the effect of an order awarding security for costs would be to stultify the litigation. Indeed as was clear during the hearing it would be the second applicant, Mr Tracy, who would be providing any security for costs ordered (TS 23 November 2006 p 585 ll 25-27). As pointed out by Jessup J in Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1279 at [49] , there is an intrinsic connection between the 'stultify factor' and the 'persons standing behind' factor as described by Beazley J in KB Cable . That the second applicant and his wife, Mrs Adrienne Tracy, are principal beneficiaries (and in the case of the second applicant, the principal architect), of the litigation before me is also clear from the evidence (for example TS 17 November 2006 p 194 ll 31; TS 17 November 2006 p 219 ll 41-43; TS 20 November 2006 p 233 ll 16-19, and exhibit R15). Further, that Mr and Mrs Tracy are of considerable means was made clear from evidence before the Court, including a balance sheet describing assets and liabilities of the second applicant, Mrs Tracy and their companies as at 12 November 2004 (exhibit R14). No undertakings have been provided by the second applicant or any other person as to the costs to which the first and third applicants may become liable. Accordingly in such circumstances security for costs may be ordered to ensure that those who stand to benefit from the litigation undertake some of the risks. ( Rosenfield Nominees Pty Ltd v Bain &amp; Co (1988) 14 ACLR 467 at 472-473; Acohs Pty Ltd v Merck Ltd [1997] FCA 573 ; Costa Vraca v Bell Regal Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 65 at [77] ; Harpur v Ariadne at 532; Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation [1984] FCA 34 ; (1984) 2 FCR 1 at 4; Bryan E Fencott Pty Ltd v Eretta Pty Ltd [1987] FCA 102 ; (1987) 16 FCR 497 at 511; Interline Hydrocarbon at [35]; Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1279 at [49] - [51]. )</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] FCA 1498">The November trial date of this matter has been known by all parties since late July 2006. At the directions hearing of 28 July 2006 I indicated to the parties the importance of compliance with Court directions in this matter and the need to be prepared for trial in November. As pointed out recently by Jessup J in Acohs Pty L Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 1279 at [61] - [63], citing authorities including Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 308, it is an accepted principle in the ordering of security for costs that such an application should be made promptly. Although I know that the respondents did not file an application for security for costs until after it was clear that a mediated settlement of this matter would not take place, the success or otherwise of the mediation would not have prevented the respondents applying at an earlier date for security for costs of the trial, particularly if payment was sought to be made after the date by which medication was ordered to take place. While I note that the respondents had earlier sought and obtained an order for security for pre-trial costs, no satisfactory explanation has been provided as to why an application for security for trial costs has been brought on what is, in effect, the eve of the trial.</sentence>
