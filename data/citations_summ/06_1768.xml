<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 190">It seems to me that if the relevant statement has any operation at all it is as an exemption clause. The submissions on this topic were very brief, perhaps because it was not suggested that the relevant statement affected the respondent's liability under the Trade Practices Act or the Fair Trading Act ( Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592). A number of issues arise. First, there is an issue as to whether Angas had notice of the relevant statement such that it became a term of the contract. The valuation report was sent to Angas some time after the retainer was entered into, but the respondent sought to rely on previous dealings between Angas and the respondent and evidence given by Mr Hower and Mr Morton in cross-examination. There are of course a number of cases on this question (see, for example, Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay [1988] HCA 32 ; (1988) 165 CLR 197 ; Hardchrome Engineering Pty Ltd v Kambrook Distributing Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 359 ; eBay International AG v Creative Festival Entertainment Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1768 ; Hill &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Walter H Wright Pty Ltd [1971] VicRp 92 ; [1971] VR 749). Secondly, there is an issue as to the proper construction of the clause. Again, there are a number of authorities dealing with the proper construction of exemption clauses (see, for example, Darlington Futures Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd (1986) 161 CLR 500 ; Alderslade v Hendon Laundry Ltd [1945] 1 KB 189 ; Davis v Pearce Parking Station Pty Ltd [1954] HCA 44 ; (1954) 91 CLR 642 ; Commissioner for Railways (New South Wales) v Quinn [1946] HCA 12 ; (1946) 72 CLR 345. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 876">In an ordinary contractual relationship, if a ticket or other document is intended by the issuer to incorporate another document that contains terms of a contract, such as an exclusion clause or a foreign jurisdiction clause, the issuer cannot rely on those terms unless, at the time of the contract, it did all that was reasonably necessary to bring the terms to the other party's attention: Oceanic Sun Shipping Company Inc v Fay [1988] HCA 32 ; (1988) 165 CLR 197 at 228-229 per Brennan J; McRobertson, Miller Airline Services v Commissioner of State Taxation (WA) [1975] HCA 55 ; (1975) 133 CLR 125 at 137 per Stephen J, 143 per Jacobs; Sydney Corporation v West [1965] HCA 68 ; (1965) 114 CLR 481 at 485 per Barwick CJ and Taylor J, see too at 503 per Windeyer; eBay International AG v Creative Festival Entertainment [2006] FCA 1768 ; (2006) 170 FCR 450 at 453 [19] per myself; cp Toll 219 CLR at 184 [55] distinguishing between cases where a contract is signed and "ticket" cases where the document is handed by one party to the other. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] VCC 1531"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] NSWSC 844">24 This object is necessary and achieved, albeit in another way, in traditional sales in an auction room. 25 Furthermore, for the purpose of organizing and carrying out an auction, the Internet consists of a vast auction room extending to infinity and able to change in order to take account of the changes in physical space in which the offers of auctions are distributed. "

(2) In eBay International AG v Creative Festival Entertainment Pty Ltd (2006) Aust Contract R 90-248 ; [2006] FCA 1768 (a case in which eBay claimed that a condition contained on the reverse of tickets sold by Creative conveyed representations that constituted misleading and deceptive conduct on the part of Creative), Rares J described eBay as follows:

"[4] eBay is a Swiss corporation which operates a website in Australia as well as other websites in various places in the world. eBay's websites are part of an online global market place which the eBay group operates. Registered users of eBay websites, known as members, are able to buy and sell many types of goods and services online.</sentence>
