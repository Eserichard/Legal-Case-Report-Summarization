<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 388">Before leaving this aspect of the matter, it is relevant to consider the tax jurisdiction of the Court where the relevant document is an "Appeal Statement". An "Appeal Statement" is defined in the FCR to be a statement "outlining succinctly the Commissioner's contentions and the facts and issues in the appeal as the Commissioner perceives them": O 52B r 5(3) of the FCR. They take the place of pleadings, but they are not, in substance, pleadings: WR Carpenter at [35]; McDonald's Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2008] FCA 395 ; (2008) 69 ATR 898 at [6] ; see also Pacific Exchange Corporation Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1155 ; (2009) 180 FCR 300 at [3] (cf Rio Tinto Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 335 ; (2004) 55 ATR 321 at [22] --- [27] and [58]). Their stated purpose is different --- to give each party and the Court a practical understanding of the parties' positions and summarise the essential issues on appeal: BAE Systems Australia (NSW) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation for the Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 48 ; (2008) 69 ATR 567 at [19] . Further, they are not subject to the same scrutiny as a pleading: BAE at [19]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] AATA 47"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] SASCFC 59">There has been much consideration of Aon in later decisions, both at the interlocutory single judge level and at the intermediate court level. There have been in the order of 200 published judgments where Aon has influenced the decision. Although not all of those involve applications to amend pleadings, a substantial number do. In those proceedings, the circumstances surrounding the applications to amend are varied. Unsurprisingly, different results have ensued. Applications to amend raising points of substance, prior to the setting of a date for trial, have almost always without exception, [105] been allowed. [106] Appropriate orders to address prejudice have been made. [107] Applications to amend at or immediately prior to or during trial have often been refused, [108] however, even very late applications to amend have been allowed. [109] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1224">I respectfully agree with these observations. They accord with my own experience both when in practice and as a judge. I had occasion last year in my capacity as Tax List Coordinating Judge for the Queensland Registry to be reminded of the difficulties that can attend taxation liability litigation when the Commissioner chooses neither to engage the Australian Government Solicitor nor a private firm of solicitors to act for him as solicitor on the record: see Pacific Exchange Corporation Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1155 ; (2009) 180 FCR 300 at [54] --- [59]. In that case a member of the Queensland Bar appeared for the Commissioner directly briefed by him, via his Legal Services Branch. On that occasion, unlike the present, an officer of that branch did not seek or claim to be solicitor on the record. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 415">However, unreasonable insistence on the part of the Commissioner in electing to put a taxpayer to proof may give rise, once the judicial power of the Commonwealth is engaged, to questions of procedural fairness: Pacific Exchange Corporation v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1155 ; (2009) 180 FCR 300 at p 308, at [39]. By analogy, such insistence may also give rise to special costs consequences. However, at what point does the Commissioner's insistence upon a right to see and test admissible evidence of foundation facts relied upon by the taxpayer to demonstrate that an amended assessment is excessive, give rise to any special order for costs rather than an order for party and party costs against the Commissioner in a taxpayer's successful appeal proceeding? </sentence>
