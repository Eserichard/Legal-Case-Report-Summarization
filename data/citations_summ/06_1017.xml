<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1559">For the reasons set out earlier (see [50] to [51]), I reject the defendants' contention that Espasia has not met the threshold of at least 90% by value. The defendants' calculations are referable not to the value of the securities of the Company as assessed by WHK but Espasia's offer price (cf the comments of Emmett J in Regional Publishers Pty Ltd v Elkington [2006] FCA 1017 ; (2006) 154 FCR 218 at [35] and [55]). WHK's task was to assess whether that offer price was a "fair value" for the securities. WHK's conclusion having regard to the "value" of the securities was that the offer price did reflect a "fair value". In the present case, the price to be paid by Espasia is not the value. "Price", "Cost" and "Value" are different concepts and the definition of "Value" can and does vary depending on circumstances: see eg International Valuation Standards (6 th ed, International Valuation Standards Committee, 2003) "General Valuation Concepts and Principles" section 4.0 and "International Valuation Standards" section 3.0. In the present case, the "price" offered by Espasia should not be used for the purposes of determining whether Espasia has met the threshold in s 664A(2)(c) of the Act. OBJECTION 3: WHK'S REPORT CONTRAVENED SS 664A(2)(C) AND 667A(2)(A) AND (B) OF THE ACT 
  The relevant statutory framework, including its history, has been the subject of previous decisions: see eg Capricorn Diamonds Investments Pty Ltd v Catto [2002] VSC 105 ; (2002) 5 VR 61 at [21] - [29]; Austrim Nylex Ltd v Kroll (No 2) [2002] VSC 193 ; (2002) 42 ACSR 18 at [6] ; Resource Surveys Pty Ltd v Harmony Gold (Australia) Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 391 ; (2002) 121 FCR 452 ; ConocoPhillips WA --- 248 Pty Ltd v Batoka Pty Ltd [2005] WASC 184 ; (2005) 54 ACSR 646 ; Regional Publishers Pty Ltd v Elkington [2006] FCA 1017 ; [2006] FCA 1017 ; (2006) 154 FCR 218 at [2] - [8] and Mitsui &amp; Company Ltd v Hanwha (HK) Company Ltd [2007] FCA 2070 ; (2007) 166 FCR 187 at [22] - [27].  Finally, there was nothing before the Court to suggest, let alone establish, that the terms of the compulsory acquisition were other than for fair value: s 664F(3) of the Act. As stated by Emmett J in Regional Publishers Pty Ltd v Elkington [2006] FCA 1017 ; (2006) 154 FCR 218 at [58] "it is a matter for the Court, on the basis of the evidence before it ... to determine whether [the terms of the compulsory acquisition of the securities] gives shareholders a fair value. " That task has been undertaken. </sentence>
