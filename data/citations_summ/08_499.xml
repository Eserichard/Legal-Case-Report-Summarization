<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1267">Without any attempt to be exhaustive, when such a departure does arise the difficulties to be confronted include the following: the very fact that the appellant before the Court is unrepresented and the practical and legal difficulties confronting those who claim refugee status. Some claimants, it must be recognised, are " engaged in an often desperate battle for freedom, if not life itself " ( Abebe v Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 577 to 578 per Gummow and Hayne JJ) (" Abebe "); the general principle that a party, including an unrepresented party, is normally bound at the appeal stage by the manner in which a case is advanced for resolution at first instance (cf. University of Wollongong v Metwally (No 2) (1985) 59 ALJR 481 at 483); the public interest in cases, particularly in this area of the law, being resolved in a timely manner ( Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 929 at [62] , [2001] FCA 929 ; 192 ALR 71 at 86); the fact that the Legislature has identified the Federal Magistrates Court as the primary court in which cases in this area are to be resolved and the potential for that legislative objective to be frustrated or undermined if the role of the Federal Court as an intermediate court of appeal was transformed into a de facto court of first instance ( SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 at [30] ); the potential for the Court to either so assist the unrepresented party that the other side is disadvantaged or --- and a consideration of equal importance --- that the Court may be seen to so assist the unrepresented party that the other represented party may see itself as being at a disadvantage ( Vaeula v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 147 at [59]); the potential for tension (if not conflict) in the role to be discharged by the legal representatives for the respondent Minister, a role somewhat curiously called the " model litigant " --- the tension being between assisting the Court and representing the litigious interests of the Minister; and the fact that an appellate court is denied the benefit of reasons for decision in respect to the new argument sought to be advanced for the first time on appeal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 585">Ms Rayment indicated to the Court that the Minister is not prejudiced in cases where an extension of time is sought pursuant to s.477. However, an exception arises in cases of gross delay where the documents may have been destroyed. Prejudice cannot be the basis on which to grant an extension of time, especially as it is in the public interest to dispose of cases of this nature expeditiously: SZKMS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 per Lander J at [29] ---[30]. </sentence>

Applicant
 
 
And
 
 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION &amp; CITIZENSHIP 
First Respondent
 
 REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
Second Respondent
 
 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 This is an application for an extension of time pursuant to s.477(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (" the Act ") to file an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (" the Tribunal "), dated 10 December 2008.  In having regard to the prejudice and the public interest, I also have regard to the fact that the Applicant has had an opportunity to pursue a legal right in seeking judicial review of the Tribunal's decision record which, for all practical purposes, he has foregone. I also accept that the First Respondent has a legitimate interest in the timely disposal of applications for protection visas as does the public ( SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 at [29] - [30] ; Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 929 ; (2001) 192 ALR 71 , per Gyles J at 86). I also have regard to the fact that s.476A(3) states that the Federal Court does not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from this decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1543">This Court may permit new grounds to be raised on appeal which were not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court. But there are very real reasons why it should not too readily do so, including: the fact that the relevant jurisdiction conferred on this Court is an appellate jurisdiction; the fact that this Court, in exercising that appellate jurisdiction, is entitled to the not inconsiderable benefit of the reasons for decision of a Federal Magistrate in respect to the issues sought to be agitated by a party to the proceeding; the principle that a party who has had a case resolved against him should usually not be permitted on appeal to raise a completely new or different case to that previously advanced; the principle that to permit a whole new case to be run on appeal has the potential to undermine the appellate process by rendering the trial process almost irrelevant; the fact that there is a legitimate public interest in public law matters being resolved in a timely and efficient manner and that the Minister has a legitimate interest in the timely resolution of applications for protection visas; and the fact that the High Court, in the event that an application for special leave to appeal is granted, is entitled to the benefit of a decision at first instance on the arguments sought to be resolved and to this Court's reasons for decision in respect to the same issues on appeal. To pursue any other course is to shift to the High Court the appellate role which it is the responsibility of this Court to discharge. 
These are but some of the matters that have been referred to in earlier decisions of this Court: e.g. Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 929 at [62] , [2001] FCA 929 ; 192 ALR 71 at 86 per Gyles J; SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 per Lander J; SZMRD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 598 per Spender J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1436">There is a very considerable public interest in all litigation being resolved as quickly and as expeditiously as the administration of justice permits. There is a recognised public interest in applications for refugee status being resolved in a timely manner and in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Migration Act : Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 929 at [62] , [2001] FCA 929 ; 192 ALR 71 at 86 per Gyles J; SZKMS [2008] FCA 499 at [30] per Lander J.  In SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 , Lander J was confronted with an application for leave to amend a Notice of Appeal and an application to adduce further evidence, being the transcript of the proceeding before the Tribunal. In refusing leave to amend, His Honour referred to those principles relevant to the grant of leave to raise new grounds on appeal but further observed (in part): 
 
 [21] Parliament has given the Federal Magistrates Court jurisdiction in relation to applications of this kind to the exclusion of this Court: s 476A of the Act. All of the issues which are sought to be ventilated should be addressed at the trial in that Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1345">In SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 , Lander J at [31] also considered the approach which a Court should take when grounds not raised before the Federal Magistrate are raised for the first time in the Federal Court on an appeal. His Honour made express reference to the fact that the mere fact that an appellant did not have legal representation in the Court below is not, by itself, a sufficient reason for the Court to grant leave for new grounds to be relied upon on appeal when the appellant gains legal representation: see [20] of SZKMS . His Honour concluded that it was necessary for the Court to at least consider the new grounds sought to be relied upon. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 857">The first ground of appeal asserts bias on the part of the Tribunal. That matter was not raised before the Federal Magistrate, and so her Honour's failure to consider that matter cannot amount to error on the part of the Federal Magistrate. That in itself is sufficient to dispose of that ground of appeal. This is an appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court and not from the Tribunal. In any event, there is simply nothing identified in the submissions of the appellant which could support that claim. There is nothing which has been pointed out to me, or from my reading of the materials in the Appeal Book, which suggests that the Tribunal did not approach its task with an open mind: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Jia (2001) 205 CLR 507. Apart from the complaint of procedural fairness made to the Federal Magistrate, much of what the appellant said about the Tribunal's reasons indicates that he was really seeking to complain about the merits of the decision of the Tribunal, but it is not the role of the Federal Magistrates Court simply to review the merits of such decisions: Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259. However, principally I reject that ground of appeal because it was not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court at all and so cannot show error by the Federal Magistrate: SZKMS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 499. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 598">A problem similar to the present was considered by Lander J in SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 ( SZKMS ). In the case before his Honour, the appellant sought leave to amend the Notice of Appeal in accordance with a further Amended Notice of Appeal. They also sought leave to adduce further evidence on the appeal, being the transcript of the hearings before the Tribunal on 18 January and 14 February 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 217">(Emphasis in original) 

 
The same construction was given to s 430 by the then Chief Justice: [2001] HCA 30 at [10] , [2001] HCA 30 ; 206 CLR 323 at 331 to 332. Whatever uncertainty may have prevailed prior to Yusuf, notwithstanding the unambiguous terms of s 430, there now remains no uncertainty as to the proper construction of s 430 or the requirements imposed: eg. SZJOC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1342 at [20] per Graham J; SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 at [52] per Lander J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCA 99">The remaining five grounds were not raised before the Federal Magistrate, and the Minister objected to leave being granted to rely upon them for the first time on the appeal. In SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 at [18] --- [31], Lander J reviewed the authorities on the question of the grant of leave in these circumstances. His Honour was of the view that this court should not be made, de facto, the court of original jurisdiction when sitting on appeal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1866">68 Allegations of bias impact on the integrity of the Tribunal, and should be carefully and fully considered. Undoubtedly an adjournment would have been necessary if the evidence was accepted. However, while the Federal Magistrates Court has an exceptionally busy case load, there was no indication by his Honour of case management issues impacting on the exercise of his discretion: see, eg, Black Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1623. There was no suggestion that if an adjournment were granted the first respondent would be prejudiced in the conventional way other than as to costs, although there is a public interest in hearing refugee matters expeditiously: see Sali v SPC Ltd [1993] HCA 47 ; (1993) 116 ALR 625 , 628-29; Bloch v Bloch [1981] HCA 56 ; (1981) 180 CLR 390 , 395-96; and SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2008) FCA 499 at [29] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 1372">If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish. The importance of litigants, especially in the present statutory context, raising all arguments in need of resolution in the Federal Magistrates Court cannot be underestimated. In SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 Lander J referred to the appellate jurisdiction of this Court being exercised by a single judge pursuant to s 25(1AA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and continued:
 [24] The appellate process is to correct error. If a party is entitled to raise issues for the first time on appeal, the appeal court will become de facto the primary court. That is undesirable.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 1379">7 It is necessary, in order to protect the integrity of the appellate jurisdiction, that parties be bound in the way in which they conduct an application for judicial review before the Federal Magistrates Court. On the other hand, before rejecting an application to raise a new ground for the first time on appeal, it will normally be incumbent upon the appellate court to determine whether the ground has any legal merit. The curious result is that, where an application to raise a new ground was not previously raised at first instance, the Court will need to consider the ground in determining whether or not it should consider the ground in substance (see generally SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 , at [24] to [26] and [31]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FCA 609">[40] To allow the appellant to articulate these grounds on appeal would be to allow the appellant to treat this Court as a Court at first instance. Such a course of action is unsatisfactory, not only for this Court but also for the High Court which would hear any application for special leave from this decision. It would put the High Court, as it were, in a position of hearing applications for special leave from a court of first instance: SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499. [41] However, authority seems to suggest that I need to consider whether the grounds have merit before I determine whether I should give leave for the appellant to raise the matters: VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158. In VUAX the conclusion was reached that leave to argue a ground of appeal not raised before the primary judge should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so: [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FCA 502">40 To allow the appellant to articulate these grounds on appeal would be to allow the appellant to treat this Court as a Court at first instance.
