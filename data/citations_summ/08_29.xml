<citances>
<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] NSWSC 644">45 At least the claim for interlocutory injunctive relief is urgent equitable relief expressly contemplated by clause 23.5. The question whether the two routes provided for in clause 23, namely arbitration or litigation seeking urgent equitable relief, are alternative courses, such that where the latter is invoked there is no agreement to submit the subject matter of the dispute to arbitration, is not straightforward (see Seeley International Pty Limited v Electra Air Conditioning BV [2008] FCA 29 at [37] ). Nor was it the subject of detailed argument. Although senior counsel for the defendant cited Seeley International Pty Limited v Electra Air Conditioning BV , it was for a different proposition. In my view, the fact that a party might invoke curial jurisdiction to obtain urgent equitable relief, particularly interlocutory relief, is not inconsistent with the parties' agreeing to refer the subject matter of their dispute to arbitration after the claim for urgent equitable relief has been determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] QCCTBCCM 11">Nevertheless, in arbitrations, arbitrators can make awards in the form of declarations as to the result of the decision on the issues to be determined. This arises from an implied power to that effect: see Seeley International Pty Ltd v Electra Air Conditioning BV [2008] FCA 29 at [27] referring to Cufone v Cruse [2000] SASC 304. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] WASCA 110">47 As the dispute in relation to Paharpur's claim on the bill of exchange is not, pursuant to the terms of the arbitration agreement, capable of settlement by arbitration, it follows that s 7 of the International Arbitration Act has no application to it: Comandate Marine Corp v Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 192 ; (2006) 157 FCR 45 [238]; Recyclers of Australia Pty Ltd v Hettinga Equipment Inc [2000] FCA 547 [18], [19], Seeley International Pty Ltd v Electra Air Conditioning BV [2008] FCA 29 [16].</sentence>
