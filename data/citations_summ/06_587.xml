<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 97">The First Respondent did not submit that he has suffered prejudice by reason of the Applicant's tardiness.

However, it contends that the Full Court has held that " the mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension ".

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 907">23 In SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at [231] , Allsop J construed this as referring to a consideration of whether the breach of that duty to accord procedural fairness was or was not trivial; in the operation of the principles of procedural fairness (and the statutory provisions providing it) adherence to the mandated process and procedure is vital. It is not a proper basis, in the exercise of discretion, to refuse relief for failure to comply with s 359A of the Act simply because no injustice had resulted or ' because to do so would be in the opinion of the Court futile or that the case is so weak that it does not warrant appellate intervention ' ( SZGPB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 587 at [56] per Rares J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 694">Mr Mitchell submits that the delay from the time the Tribunal decision was handed down and when the applicant filed her application in the Federal Magistrates Court, is grounds to refuse relief in the exercise of the Court's discretion: SAAP at [80], [174] and [211]; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [82] - [83]; SZGPB v Minister for Immigration (No.2) [2006] FCA 587 at [60] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FMCA 1394">Counsel for the First Respondent submitted that the delay between the date when the Tribunal handed down its decision and the date the Applicant filed his application in this Court is reason for the Court to exercise its discretion to refuse relief (see SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [80], [174] and [211]; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at 117 [82] - [83]; SZGPB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 587 at [60] ).</sentence>
