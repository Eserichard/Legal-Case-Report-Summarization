<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 29">3 On 6 May 2009, the learned primary judge made a declaration in the following terms:
 Clause 7.6 of the Woolworths Limited Supermarkets Distribution Centres (South East Queensland) Certified Agreement 2004 (No CA643 of 2004), being a Preserved State Agreement ("the PSA"), when read in conjunction with the terms of Chapter 2 Part 3 of the Industrial Relations Act 1999 (Qld) in relation to an entitlement to long service leave, grants an entitlement to an employee (whose employment is regulated by the PSA) engaged by the respondent on non-rotating afternoon shifts or night shifts, to payment for long service leave at a wage rate which includes amounts payable to that employee whilst at work, as set out in clauses 6.3.3(c), 6.3.3(d) and 6.8 of the PSA. Her Honour's reasons for judgment are published as Shop Distributive &amp; Allied Employees Association (Queensland Branch) Union of Employees v Woolworths Limited (ACN 000 034 819) [2009] FCA 441. 
  61 The above records, in a somewhat convoluted way, that the Court had jurisdiction to deal with this matter, as the primary judge did on 6 May 2009 (see Shop Distributive &amp; Allied Employees Association (Queensland Branch) Union of Employees v Woolworths Limited (ACN 000 034 819) [2009] FCA 441 especially at [11]-[12]) and the Full Court may hear and determine the present appeal.
