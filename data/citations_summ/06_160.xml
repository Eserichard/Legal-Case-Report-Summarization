<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] ATMO 19">At the same time, and despite the removal applicant's submissions to the contrary, I believe that this is exactly the type of case where the registrar's discretion is justifiably exercised in an opponent's favour. I refuse to restrict the goods in any way. To the extent the use of the trade mark might fall some way short of covering all of the goods of the registration, I am reminded of the comments of Finkelstein J in Colorado Group Limited v Strandbags Group Pty Limited [2006] FCA 160: 
24 When considering proprietorship it is important to remember that there is no proprietorship in a mark per se. Under the common law "property in a trade-mark is ... the right to the exclusive use of some mark, name or symbol in connection with a particular manufacture or vendible commodity": Leather Cloth Co Ltd v American Leather Couch Co Ltd [1863] EngR 1050 ; (1863) 4 De G J &amp; S 137 , 144. See also Ainsworth v Walmsley (1866) 1 Eq 518 , 524 ("This Court has taken upon itself to protect a man in the use of a certain trade-mark as applied to a particular description of article").</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 406">49 There was some dispute between the parties as to the relevant date at which Hansen's reputation should be assessed. Bickfords contented that the relevant date is when the impugned conduct commenced, or whenever the passing off was first threatened, whichever is earlier. Bickfords relied on the decision of Finkelstein J in Colorado Group Ltd v Strandbags Group Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 160 ; (2006) 67 IPR 628 , and argued that the impugned conduct commenced no later than 29 November 2005, being the date when Mr Hukowskyj of Bickfords met with Jessica Brown of Coles and first raised the concept of supplying a 440 mL energy drink product to Coles. At that time, Bickfords had lodged applications for registration of the MONSTER and MONSTER ENERGY names.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] ATMO 19">&#8226; If the stylised letters V within the relevant trade marks were to be impermissibly compared side by side, they are not, when allowance is made for the lack of inherent capacity to distinguish in the letter V per se, substantially identical: Shell , and see Colorado Group Limited v Strandbags Group Pty Limited [2006] FCA 160 at paragraph 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCAFC 184">
 

 
 The American aspect of the name is seen as an advantage, equating to;- 
 

&#8226; Fashion 
&#8226; Quality 
&#8226; Style implication (rugged). " 

 
It was suggested that the brand's "new image" be built around the Colorado mountain logo. Significantly the trial judge also referred to the following part of the report (67 IPR 628 , [2006] FCA 160 at [10] ):
 
 "The report also discussed 'Brand Registration'. It noted: 'Under Australian trademark law, registration of geographical names are [sic] difficult. Currently we are endeavouring to register Colorado as a business name and our distinctive mountain logo as a trademark. 4 In order for a person properly to register a trade mark, the person must be the owner (formerly, proprietor, which is the same thing) of the trade mark: see ss 27(1) and 58. As the learned primary judge said (in Colorado Group Ltd v Strandbags Group Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 160 ; (2006) 67 IPR 628 ("first judgment") at [23]):
 
 First, in respect of a mark which has never been used the proprietor is the person who is (or claims through) the author of the mark (which could include the copyist of a foreign mark) and intends to use it: In re Hudson's Trade-Marks (1886) 32 Ch D 311 , 319-320; Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Rohm &amp; Haas Co [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601 , 627-628. 

This proposition is not in doubt, although it does not assist in the present case. 39 The trial judge considered that issue in 67 IPR 628 , [2006] FCA 160 at [33] ---[36]. He did not refer to the terms of s 41 and did not pose the questions he answered by reference to the text of s 41. There is no discussion as to the integers of the section or how they might apply to the case. Rather, apart from a brief reference to Clark Equipment Co [1964] HCA 55 ; 111 CLR 511 , the trial judge directed himself entirely by reference to United States sources. The trial judge held that "Colorado" used in connection with the kind of goods involved was an arbitrary use, the equivalent of a fancy word, and so inherently distinctive. The trial judge went on (67 IPR 628 , [2006] FCA 160 at [36] ):
 
 "In reaching this conclusion, I have rejected the possibility, with one slight exception, that the word "Colorado" can be descriptive of backpacks or shoes. I have referred to the evidence which is to the effect that the word "Colorado" conjures up notions of trekking, ruggedness, fashion, Rocky Mountains and so on. For the most part those ideas are concerned with the image of the brand and are not descriptive of the goods themselves. 37 The trial judge referred to evidence that, when the Colorado stores were established in July 1993, it was intended that the stores would market their products with a "strong reference to [an] outdoors rugged lifestyle" ( Colorado Group Ltd v Strandbags Group Pty Ltd (2006) 67 IPR 628 , [2006] FCA 160 at [9] ). The trial judge quoted the following from a report which led to the opening of the stores:
 
 "Colorado has been chosen as it has lifestyle connotations that are representative of to [sic] the brand. Within Australia the Colorado name has very strong attributes that make it the ideal promotional platform.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] ATMO 35">It was common ground between the parties that mere non-use of a trade mark does not amount to abandonment; an intention to abandon is required ( Malibu Boats West Inc. v. Catanese 180 ALR 119 ; Riv-Oland Marble Co (Vic) Pty Ltd v. Settef SpA ALR 860; Mouson &amp; Co v Boehm (1884) 26 Ch D 398 ; Colorado Group Ltd v. Strand Banks Group Ltd , [2006] FCA 160).
