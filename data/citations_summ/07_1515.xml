<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1474">That proceeding was one " for the recovery of ... money " (cf. Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 1515 , 168 IR 353). But interest should only be ordered for " part of the period ", namely as from 4 December 2009. Although the sole Defendant to this proceeding, Mrs Kargarian, transferred the property on which the home was built in 2006, the Plaintiff liquidator did not commence the proceeding until 4 December 2009. He was appointed as liquidator on 20 September 2007. To order that interest be paid from an earlier date, it is considered, would work an unfairness to the Defendant. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1607">3 On 2 October 2007, I concluded that Telstra had breached the 2005 Enterprise Agreement by failing to pay Mr McDonald his previous rate of salary after he was redeployed to, and later accepted a redundancy package from, a lower paying position: see [2007] FCA 1515 ("the Primary Reasons"). The facts resulting in that conclusion are set out in paras [3] to [38] of the Primary Reasons. I do not propose to repeat them. These reasons for decision should be read with the Primary Reasons. I adopt the same defined terms in these reasons for decision. </sentence>
