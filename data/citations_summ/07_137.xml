<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 17">Whilst a contempt is not a federal offence for the purposes of s 17A of the Crimes Act ( Pattison (Trustee), in the matter of Bell (Bankrupt) v Bell [2007] FCA 137 at [47] ), I see no reason why the same approach ought not be taken in relation to the punishment of a contempt. Indeed, that approach is implicit in the notion that imprisonment is a "last resort".  Any such obligation endures during the bankruptcy and after discharge from bankruptcy. It is always possible, and sometimes appropriate, to impose a fine with a term of imprisonment in default of payment of it. See, for instance, Pattison (Trustee), in the matter of Bell (Bankrupt) v Bell [2007] FCA 137. Before settling on imprisonment, the primary judge ought to have directed his attention to whether some other form of punishment was appropriate for some, or all, of the charges.  I would not disturb the costs order made in the Court below. I would not make any order as to the costs of the appeal particularly as the appellant has succeeded, in part at least, by reference to an argument which was not put in the Court below. I certify that the preceding seventy-six (76) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko. Associate:

 Imprisonment 
 
 

 
 
 
 1.8 It is widely accepted that the court should only impose a term of imprisonment in the most serious criminal contempt cases: Keeley v Justice Brooking [1979] HCA 28 ; (1979) 143 CLR 162 at 179; Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238. 
 
 

 
 
 
 1.9 In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Hickey [1999] FCA 259 , Carr J held that imprisonment is a "last resort": see also R v Vasin (1985) 39 SASR 45 ; James (1985) 14 A Crim R 364 ; Skipper (1992) 4 A Crim R 260. 
 
 

 
A Court has considerable flexibility in that it may impose a penalty of fines or imprisonment and then suspend such penalty on conditions or terms: see Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey [2007] FCA 806 ; (2007) 73 IPR 45 at [90] ; Pattison (Trustee), in the matter of Bell (Bankrupt) v Bell [2007] FCA 137 at [49] . ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1125">In Collection Point [2010] FCA 1066 , I summarised the relevant principles as follows: 
 
 
 [7] The law relating to contempt proceedings, after undergoing something of an upheaval in the mid-1990s, is now fairly well settled. First, the question of power. The Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ( FCA ) gives the Federal Court "the same power to punish contempts of its power and authority as is possessed by the High Court in respect of contempts of the High Court": s 31 of the FCA. The High Court, in turn, has the same power under s 24 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) to punish contempt as was possessed by the Supreme Court of the Judicature in England as of 1903: Pattison (Trustee), in the matter of Bell (Bankrupt) v Bell [2007] FCA 137 at [43] - [44]. 
 
 

 
 
 
 [8] Any application for contempt must be commenced strictly in accordance with the Rules: Spindler v Balog (1959) 76 WN (NSW) 391. In the Federal Court, O 40 r 5 provides for a procedure which enables a Court to address the substance of any alleged contempt. 
 
 

 
 
 
 [9] ... [T]wo matters must be noted: 
 
 

 the charge being one of contravention of a court order, the contempt is civil, not criminal;
 although civil, some attributes of criminal proceedings are engaged including standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1066">The law relating to contempt proceedings, after undergoing something of an upheaval in the mid-1990s, is now fairly well settled. First, the question of power. The Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ( FCA ) gives the Federal Court "the same power to punish contempts of its power and authority as is possessed by the High Court in respect of contempts of the High Court": s 31 of the FCA. The High Court, in turn, has the same power under s 24 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) to punish contempt as was possessed by the Supreme Court of the Judicature in England as of 1903: Pattison (Trustee), in the matter of Bell (Bankrupt) v Bell [2007] FCA 137 at [43] - [44]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] NSWSC 1282">22 However, in Pattison v Bell [2007] FCA 137 , Gray J of the Federal Court of Australia considered Re Bramblevale and Lewis v Pontypridd and concluded that, in principle, it lies upon anyone making an allegation that a contempt of court has been committed by a failure to perform an act required by a court order to prove that the alleged contemnor could have performed the act. His Honour said:
 

 
 
 [33] Counsel for the applicant conceded that the onus lay upon him to prove these charges beyond reasonable doubt. He did contend, however, that on any issue as to whether either of the respondents lacked the capacity or the ability to comply with an order of the Court, the onus fell on that respondent to prove that lack of capacity or inability.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1965">4 It is now well established that the Court has power to impose a fine for contempt of Court: see s 31 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and Pattison (Trustee), in the matter of Bell (Bankrupt) v Bell [2007] FCA 137 ; BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2001] FCA 336 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dynacast (Int) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 429 ; (2007) ATPR 42-156 ; Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2006] FCAFC 118 ; (2006) 152 FCR 129. </sentence>

17 Although there has been a passing suggestion to the contrary, it appears to be established that there is no power in the Federal Court to impose a community service order (a creature of statute) for the reasons expressed by Gray J in Pattison (Trustee), in the matter of Bell (Bankrupt) v Bell [2007] FCA 137 at 46-48. 
  72 In Pattison [2007] FCA 137 , although not dealing with contempt by a bankrupt, this case considered the complex situation where a contemptor's impecuniosity may prevent them from paying any fine and thus be sentenced to imprisonment in default of payment. In relation to the appropriate orders to be made in this case, Gray J observed (at [60]):
 I am of the view, however, that if Ms Bell does not pay the fine after having been allowed a substantial opportunity to acquire the money, I should impose a sentence of imprisonment in default of payment. If Ms Bell can find sufficient money to pay part of the fine, she should be given the benefit of a reduction in the default term of imprisonment commensurate with the payment she makes. I am aware that her impecuniosity may well prevent her from paying any fine. She is very likely to be made bankrupt in consequence of other orders I propose to make, particularly as to judgment against her and costs of the proceeding and of the contempt application. It can be said that to fine her with a default term of imprisonment is tantamount to imprisoning her directly. Bankruptcy would certainly put paid to any chance she might have of raising the money to pay the fine by borrowing, even assuming that she could find anyone to lend her money in her current circumstances. Nevertheless, I think that the order ought to involve imprisonment only in default of payment of the fine.  55 In several cases, but not all, it has been held that in circumstances where a contemnor is bankrupt, a fine would be inappropriate, inadequate, or impossible. To the extent those authorities include State courts it is to be noted that State courts may be affected by the operation of detailed sentencing legislation. There is no such Act covering federal jurisdiction (see Re Colina; Ex parte Torney [1999] HCA 57 ; (1999) 200 CLR 386 , as applied by Gray J in Pattison [2007] FCA 137 at [47] - [48], in determining the inapplicability of the sentencing principles contained in the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1612">17 Counsel for the District Registrar accepted that his client bore the onus of establishing that Mr Siminton had the capacity to comply with the Full Court's order and that his failure to comply with that order was wilful. He was correct to do so: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v World Netsafe Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 159 at [51] ; Pattison v Bell [2007] FCA 137 at [34] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCA 806">91 The range of penalties available for contempt of court in this Court was also recently discussed by Gray J in Pattison (Trustee), in the matter of Bell (Bankrupt) v Bell [2007] FCA 137 ( Pattison ). His Honour referred to a judgment of Merkel J in Australian Industrial Group v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union of Australia &amp; Ors [2001] FCA 774 ; (2001) 188 ALR 653. In that judgment, faced with the disinclination of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to act to enforce an unpaid fine imposed as punishment for contempt of court Merkel J said:
