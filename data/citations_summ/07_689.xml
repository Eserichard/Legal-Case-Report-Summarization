<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 682">The Selling Agency Agreement is however terminable by either party. A contract of indefinite duration implies a right of termination at will by reasonable notice. Indeed such a provision is necessary because otherwise a party would never be able to end the contract, and its obligations would extend in perpetuity, whereas ordinarily the nature of a commercial contract leads to a conclusion that it is terminable on reasonable notice. [139] In this case a right to terminate the Selling Agency Agreement can be implied because it is: not contrary to any express provision; necessary for business efficacy; and reasonable, equitable and obvious. [140] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 63">Clause 16 of the Midland Licence gives Ferguson Holdings an express right to terminate. There is no express right in Swevenings to terminate (the Midland Licence is silent on this issue), which means that (absent the applicable mandatory transfer provisions of the Code ) its contractual obligation is impliedly of indefinite duration. A contract of indefinite duration implies a right of termination at will by reasonable notice: indeed such a provision is necessary because otherwise a party would never be able to end the contract, and its obligations would extend in perpetuity, whereas ordinarily the nature of a commercial contract leads to a conclusion that it is terminable on reasonable notice. [82] In this case a right to terminate the Midland Licence can be implied because it is not contrary to any express provision, is necessary for business efficacy, and is reasonable, equitable and obvious. Furthermore, it is at least, as to a transfer of the franchise, consistent with the Code . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 946">8 The second matter relied upon is that the applicant contends that the issue upon which the respondent was ultimately successful was never argued by the respondent. In that regard reference is made to [25] to [28] of my reasons for judgment of 9 May 2007 (see Eden Construction Pty Ltd v State of New South Wales (No 2) [2007] FCA 689). Given the separate questions, this point does not warrant analysis.</sentence>
