<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 583">1 On 7 August 2007 I gave reasons for judgment in an earlier proceeding in which the first respondent, Mr Richard Lewarne made a number of claims including claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) against the second and third respondents, Momentum Productions Pty Ltd, and Mr Richard Scotts; Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1136. Mr Lewarne was largely successful in his claims and I directed the parties to bring in short minutes of order for the resolution of the matter in the light of my findings and reasons. On 9 October 2007 I made a number of orders including that the present applicant, Mr John Vouris, be appointed receiver and manager of the partnership that I found had existed between Mr Lewarne, Mr Scotts and Momentum Productions and of the business they conducted at the East Village Hotel in Palmer Street, Sydney; [2007] FCA 1530. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 547">3 The orders from which the appeal is brought were made on 9 October 2007 (see Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1530) for reasons given on that occasion and earlier, on 7 August 2007 (see Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1136). When the reasons of 7 August 2007 were delivered, the primary judge, at the request of the parties, made no order for relief but rather allowed the parties a reasonable time to bring in short minutes for the resolution of the matter in the light of her Honour's findings and reasons. </sentence>

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 (revised from transcript) 
 I have before me a creditor's petition which was listed today for hearing after two adjournments by consent, the petition being filed on 13 December 2007. The petitioner is, in effect, the receiver of a partnership relating to a hotel business which has been placed in receivership by order of Stone J. The partners were the parties to the proceedings before her Honour which gave rise to her Honour's judgments in Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1136 and Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1530. </sentence>
