<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 594">After I formed the above view and informed the parties, Mr Priestley, in effect, sought leave to reopen his applications for leave to appeal in order to raise further matters as to why leave should be granted. He raised matters that were the subject of previous decisions by me in relation to the alleged invalidity of s 31A of the Federal Court Act and O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules ( Priestley v Godwin (No 3) [2008] FCA 1529 ; (2008) 172 FCR 139) and in relation to the applicability of the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT) ( Priestley v Godwin (No 2) [2008] FCA 1453 ; (2008) 171 FCR 493). He also raised allegations, unsupported by evidence, of what he termed bias and jurisdictional error. I dealt with Mr Priestley's allegations of bias in Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 1179. Those allegations were also the subject of an application to the High Court and were described by French CJ as ' not tenable ' ( Priestley v Godwin (Parliamentary Service Merit Protection Commissioner) [2008] HCA 59 ; (2008) 251 ALR 612 at [31] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 169">This is an application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal and if that were granted, seeking leave to appeal, from a judgment of a judge of the Court given on 16 October 2008: Priestley v Godwin (No 3) [2008] FCA 1529. The primary judge made a declaration that neither s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), nor O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules is invalid and ordered that the applicant, Michael Priestley, pay the respondents' costs. Originally there were two separate motions but on 11 February 2009 I ordered in chambers, by consent, that both sets of proceedings seeking relief in respect of the primary judge's orders be consolidated. </sentence>
