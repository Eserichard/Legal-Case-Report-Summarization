<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWCA 413">149 Some awards of damages for a tort have included GST on the individual items that go to make up the quantum: eg, my judgment in Bennett v Goodwin [2005] NSWSC 930 ; (2005) 62 ATR 515 at [16] - [17] (which related to conversion of goods); Nemeth v Prynew Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 511 at [3] - [6] per Macready AsJ (which related to nuisance through removal of lateral support to land --- Piling Contractors (Qld) Pty Ltd v Prynew Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 118). Similarly, in Martin v London County Council [1947] KB 628 , where damages were awarded against a bailee for having failed to exercise care concerning the bailed items, the quantum of damages was assessed as the cost of replacement articles including (English) purchase tax. Other decisions have included GST in the amount properly payable under an indemnity for legal costs: my judgment in Vrkic v Otta International [2003] NSWSC 641 at [25] - [26]; Thornton v Apollo Nominees Pty Ltd [2005] TASSC 38 ; (2005) 15 Tas R 35 per Evans J. In Tenderwatch Pty Ltd v Reed Business Information Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 931 ; (2008) 78 IPR 329 at [21] , Heerey J, in quantifying the profits for which a copyright infringer was being required to account, deducted GST that the infringer had paid in the course of his infringing activities because it "reduced the actual profit or benefit derived by [the infringer] from the infringement. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 7">LE2003 also submits that it was incorrect for her Honour to include Edwards' claimed wages of $1000 per week to be deducted from the account of profits. When calculating the monthly costs in respect of the 38 months in question her Honour accepted and included claimed wages to Mr Edwards of $4,333 per month. This amount in our view was wrongly included. It is well-settled law that an infringing party cannot claim remuneration or director's fees for carrying on the infringing activities: see Le Plastrier &amp; Co Ltd v Armstrong Holland (1926) 26 SR (NSW) 585 at [593]; Tenderwatch v Reed Business Information Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 931 at [17] - [19]. In reaching her conclusion as to profits her Honour took into account evidence that at earlier stages of the business LFS was not making large profits. </sentence>
