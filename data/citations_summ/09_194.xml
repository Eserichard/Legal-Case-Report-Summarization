50 Some possible assistance may also be found in the recent decision of Tracey J of the Federal Court in Bovis Lend Lease v Construction Forestry Mining &amp; Energy Union [2009] FCA 194 ; (2009) 254 ALR 306. The first charge preferred in that case provided:
 

 
 
 "In breach of paragraph 2 of the Order, on 19 February 2009 and 20 February 2009 and continuing, the Respondent failed to remove vehicles within its control that interfered with or impeded access to the New Royal Children's Hospital (RCH Site), situate at 52 Flemington Road, Parkville. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 650">On 19 February 2009 and again on 23 February 2009 officials and members of the Respondent ("the CFMEU") obstructed and interfered with the passage of vehicles seeking to enter the New Royal Children's Hospital Site, in breach of an order made by Marshall J on 19 February 2009 ("the Order"). I have found that the CFMEU thereby committed contempt of Court: see Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (2009) 254 ALR 306 ; [2009] FCA 194. It is now necessary to determine appropriate penalties for these contempts.  The Applicant submitted that the conduct of the CFMEU in this proceeding, (see generally Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (2009) 254 ALR 306 ; [2009] FCA 194 at [23] - [29], [32]-[33]), was such that the Court could not be confident that the CFMEU would be deterred from engaging in similar conduct in the future unless a significant penalty were imposed. It was accepted by the CFMEU that there was a need for specific and general deterrence where contempts of Court have occurred. Counsel for the CFMEU submitted that the legal expenses which it had incurred in relation to the case constituted a significant deterrent, independently of any monetary penalty which might be imposed. They contended that it was proper for the Court to take into consideration the "significant burden imposed by any costs order against [a] respondent": see BHP Steel at [13] and [53]; and the fact that the defending of the proceeding had involved a cost burden on the CFMEU. The CFMEU's legal costs were said to be $78,000. In support of this contention, the CFMEU also relied on Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Construction Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1221 ; Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Consturctions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 ; Pine v Expoconti Pty Ltd (2005) 147 IR 426 ; and Furlong v Maxim Electrical Services (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1705. </sentence>
