<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1079">15 The consequences of delay in making the application for quotation is similar to the circumstances in Re Insurance Australia Group Ltd [2003] FCA 581 ; (2003) 128 FCR 581 and in Laserbond Limited (ACN 057 636 692), in the matter of Laserbond Limited (ACN 057 636 692) [2007] FCA 2056. In Re Insurance Australia the purpose and effect of granting the orders was that doing so would simply ensure that investors who had applied for relevant shares would receive securities in accordance with the applications they had made. In Laserbond I expressed the view in the context of s 1322(4)(d) that:
 21 A liberal construction is given to s 1322 (per Lindgren J at [27] in Insurance Australia Group Ltd [2003] NSWCA 71 ; 21 ACLC 1 ,107 above and as adopted by French J in Re Wave Capital Ltd [2003] NSWCA 71 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 1 ,995 at [30]). Using this approach, it follows that s 1322(4)(d) enables the Court to extend the time periods referred to above in ss 723 and 724 even though no absolute positive obligation to make the application for listing and to achieve quotation on the ASX is spelt out in the time periods designated in those sections. 22 In addition to the statutory requirements to be taken into account by the Court pursuant to subs (6) of s 1322 , there is, as with the exercise of any discretion, a requirement to exercise it judicially having regard to the subject matter, scope and purpose of the specific provisions and the general legislative framework. As French J observed in Wave Capital 21 ACLC at [29]: 
 
 Like the discretion to validate invalid share issues under s 254E , the power conferred by s 1322 must be exercised having regard to the requirements of the purposes of the Corporations Act and any other relevant statutes whose application may be in issue. It must also be exercised having regard to the interest of all parties affected and the public interest in ensuring compliance with statute law and company constitutions. Evidence of a blatant disregard of the provisions of the Act or the constitution of the company may lead to refusal of relief.
