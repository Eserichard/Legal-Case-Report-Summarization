<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 145">18 Some support for our construction is found in Elliott v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 67. In that case, R D Nicholson J approved (at [40]) a statement by the MRT that in order to satisfy sub-reg 1.15(1)(c)(ii), a visa applicant must not have had any contact with an overseas near relative within a reasonable period before making the application. The overseas near relatives in question were the visa applicant's mother and half-siblings, and his Honour said (at [38]) that sub-reg 1.15(1)(c)(ii) was to be applied to all or any of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 460">15 The applicant asserts that this is supported by the construction of the provision given by RD Nicholson J, at first instance, in Elliott v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 67 at [38] and [40] (cited at [18] and [19] of the applicant's submissions). The Minister noted that Elliott did not concern the issue raised in the present case. The Minister submits that the excerpts cited by the applicant do not support the applicant's submission; the applicant has omitted the final sentence of [38] which would, in part, serve to undermine the construction proffered. RD Nicholson J said at [38]:
 'The question which the Tribunal was required to answer in relation to subreg 1.15(1)(c)(ii) was whether the applicant had an overseas near relative with whom he had not had contact within a reasonable period before making the application. In the case of the applicant, the question was referrable to his mother and/or half-siblings. ' (Emphasis added) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1739">16 For the Minister it was submitted that the magistrate's view of the construction of reg 1.15(1)(c)(ii) was correct. Attention was drawn to Elliott v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Another [2005] FCAFC 22 in which the meaning of "contact" for the purposes of reg 1.15(1)(c)(ii) and how absence of the same might permissibly be demonstrated was considered initially by R D Nicholson J [2006] FCA 67 , R D Nicholson J, 9 February 2006 (corrigendum 22 March 2006), unreported and later by the Full Court [2007] FCAFC 22 ; (2007) 156 FCR 559. The submission was made that both at first instance and on appeal in that case the reasons of the Court had been predicated on the proposition that it was necessary to satisfy reg 1.15(1)(c)(ii) even in those cases whereby, in light of a visa applicant's Australian residence and the Full Court's decision in Hidalgo , it was unnecessary for that visa applicant to satisfy reg 1.15(1)(c)(i). That is certainly a feature of the reasons for judgement both at first instance and on appeal in Elliott , although, as was acknowledged for the Minister, it was not made controversial in that case that satisfaction of reg 1.15(1)(c)(ii) was rendered unnecessary by an inapplicability to a visa applicant of reg 1.15(1)(c)(i). It is unsurprising therefore that there is no consideration in that case of the inter-relationship between the two items within reg 1.15(1)(c). The point is therefore free from earlier judicial consideration.</sentence>
