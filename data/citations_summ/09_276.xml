<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] HCA 17">When her Honour came to consider the application of s 243-20(1), she rejected the Commissioner's argument that Finance's practical rights of recovery or recourse against BHPDRI were wholly or at least predominantly limited to BHPDRI's assets at the plant at Boodarie [20] . In dealing with submissions concerning s 243-20(2) the primary judge said that s 243-20(2) did not adopt or incorporate a test of economic equivalence, which she regarded as "the substance if not the form of the Commissioner's submissions" [21] in relation to that provision. Her Honour regarded the interaction between Div 245 in Sched 2C of the 1936 Act and Div 243 of the Act as supporting her Honour's rejection of the economic equivalence argument [22] . Her Honour made orders allowing the appeals from the Commissioner's disallowance of objections. 
 The Full Court 

 The Full Court (Sundberg and Stone JJ agreeing with the reasons of Edmonds J) dismissed the appeals from orders made by the primary judge. Finance had external creditors. As at 30 June 2000, Finance owed approximately $37 billion to third parties. While the primary judge recognised that Finance may have acted in the BHPB Group's interests, as already noted, her Honour went on to find that Finance was not a sham [56] . The Commissioner affirmed in oral argument that he does not allege that Finance is a sham. Rather, the Commissioner submitted that it was sufficient for the purposes of s 243-20(2) to show that "[t]he corporate mind of Finance, properly exercised, was legitimately able to have Finance give up rights against [BHPDRI] if the giving up of those rights was in the interests of the [BHPB] Group as a whole. 
 The decisions below 

 
 Primary judge 

 The primary judge found that limited recourse debt was not used wholly or partly to finance or refinance BHPDRI's expenditure and accordingly Div 243 had no application to BHPDRI's debt with Finance. During the course of determining several issues before her, the primary judge found that Finance's lending accorded with the description of the essential business of a finance company in Avco Financial Services Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [15] . Her Honour found that Finance was not a sham or a mere conduit for its parent but was in the business of lending money for profit making [16] . Her Honour noted that each decision to invest or reinvest in the BHPDRI project was taken on the basis that there would be a return on the project. Initially a payback period of five years from the project's completion was expected [17] , although this was adjusted in 1997 to an expectation of a payback period of six to seven years [18] . The Commissioner did not rely on par (b). In essence, the Commissioner's argument in respect of pars (a) and (c) was that the extent of Finance's ability to recover its loan was substantially limited to BHPDRI's plant; that, therefore, there was "no economic disincentive" to Finance accepting a contractual variation formulating the limitation; and that it was therefore reasonable to conclude that there was a capacity in BHPB to procure Finance's acquiescence in a modification of its contractual right so as to confine Finance's recourse to property comprising the plant. The respondents relied on extensive assets of BHPDRI in evidence before the primary judge including general purposes leases and intellectual property and her Honour's conclusion [49] that "[i]t was by no means clear that all of [BHPDRI's] property was located at or connected with the plant at Boodarie. " It was not contested that all of BHPDRI's assets remained available at all relevant times for the purpose of discharging the debt. Finance's status of unsecured creditor gave it no right to any particular asset belonging to BHPDRI, such as the plant [50] . 
 Orders 

 The appeals should be dismissed with costs. GUMMOW J. The Court heard together nine appeals from the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court (Sundberg, Stone and Edmonds JJ) [57] , dismissing appeals against the decision of the primary judge (Gordon J) [58] . Her Honour set aside the decisions of the appellant ("the Commissioner") disallowing objections to assessments to income tax. Pursuant to s 14ZZP of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ("the Administration Act "), the primary judge allowed the objections and remitted the matters to the Commissioner to reassess the taxpayers in accordance with law. On that basis, his Honour construed s 243-20(1) and (2) correctly as confined to situations where, at the time of borrowing, the debtor is not fully at risk in relation to expenditure because of contractual limitations on the lender's rights of recourse on a relevant event of default (s 243-20(1)) or where, at the time of borrowing, the debtor, or someone else, has the capacity to bring about that state of affairs subsequently (s 243-20(2)) [24] . In so doing his Honour rejected the Commissioner's submission that s 243-20(2) requires consideration of possibilities for contractual variation which exist at the time of borrowing, a submission which was further developed before this Court. Both the primary judge [25] and the Full Court [26] expressed concern that, if the Commissioner's construction of s 243-20(1) and (2) were accepted, reversal of capital allowance deductions by including equivalent amounts in assessable income would depend on the success of projects, which would be particularly significant for special purpose project companies with few assets at the time of borrowing. Edmonds J considered that this would have the practical effect that new projects could only be undertaken easily in established companies with unencumbered assets which, at the time of borrowing, exceed the borrowing in value. 
 Submissions 

 There was no dispute between the parties that pars (b) and (c) of s 243-15(1) were satisfied. Her Honour found that Finance was not a sham or a mere conduit for its parent but was in the business of lending money for profit making [16] . Her Honour noted that each decision to invest or reinvest in the BHPDRI project was taken on the basis that there would be a return on the project. Initially a payback period of five years from the project's completion was expected [17] , although this was adjusted in 1997 to an expectation of a payback period of six to seven years [18] . Further, her Honour characterised the decisions made throughout the life of the project as "a series of reasonable and diligent decisions" made "on the basis of obtaining the best possible return in circumstances that were not ideal" [19] . It must be accepted that her Honour's observation was not confined to Finance.

It must be accepted that her Honour's observation was not confined to Finance. When her Honour came to consider the application of s 243-20(1), she rejected the Commissioner's argument that Finance's practical rights of recovery or recourse against BHPDRI were wholly or at least predominantly limited to BHPDRI's assets at the plant at Boodarie [20] . It must be accepted that her Honour's observation was not confined to Finance. When her Honour came to consider the application of s 243-20(1), she rejected the Commissioner's argument that Finance's practical rights of recovery or recourse against BHPDRI were wholly or at least predominantly limited to BHPDRI's assets at the plant at Boodarie [20] . In dealing with submissions concerning s 243-20(2) the primary judge said that s 243-20(2) did not adopt or incorporate a test of economic equivalence, which she regarded as "the substance if not the form of the Commissioner's submissions" [21] in relation to that provision. Her Honour regarded the interaction between Div 245 in Sched 2C of the 1936 Act and Div 243 of the Act as supporting her Honour's rejection of the economic equivalence argument [22] . Her Honour made orders allowing the appeals from the Commissioner's disallowance of objections. In reaching this conclusion, have regard to:
 (a) the assets of the debtor (other than assets that are indemnities or guarantees provided in relation to the debt);
 (b) any arrangement to which the debtor is a party;
 (c) whether all of the assets of the debtor would be available for the purpose of the discharge of the debt (other than assets that are security for other debts of the debtor or any other entity);
 (d) whether the debtor and creditor are dealing at arm's length in relation to the debt. " (emphasis in original) 
 
 The phrase "arm's length", which appears in par (d) of s 243-20(2), is defined in s 995-1(1) as requiring, in any determination where parties deal at arm's length, consideration of "any connection between them and any relevant circumstance". The primary judge referred [63] to the focus of the definitions in s 243-20(1), being one which fixes upon the existence of obligations upon the debtor (in this case BHP Reduced Iron) to repay a creditor (BHP Finance) the amount advanced plus interest. The primary judge then said that s 243-20(2) is intended to operate in the following manner [64] :
 
 
 "Subsection (2) is clearly intended to catch those debts which bear no existing legal limitation of the kind specified in [sub-s (1)] but where 'it is reasonable to conclude that the rights' in the event of default are 'capable' of being limited to those rights specified in [sub-s (1)]. As the applicants submitted, [sub-s (2)] is intended to catch those arrangements which have the capacity to bring about the limitation described in [sub-s (1)]. Further, her Honour characterised the decisions made throughout the life of the project as "a series of reasonable and diligent decisions" made "on the basis of obtaining the best possible return in circumstances that were not ideal" [19] .

Her Honour regarded the interaction between Div 245 in Sched 2C of the 1936 Act and Div 243 of the Act as supporting her Honour's rejection of the economic equivalence argument [22] . Accordingly, in the circumstances of the appeal (and in contrast to the way the Commissioner's case was primarily argued below) the Commissioner proceeded on these appeals on the basis that s 243-20(1) does not apply to the loan between Finance and BHPDRI. Before the primary judge the Commissioner submitted that s 243-20(2) was intended to catch those arrangements which have the capacity to bring about a limitation on a creditor's rights of the kind described in sub-s (1). The primary judge accepted that submission [27] . The Commissioner further elaborated submissions on the point in these appeals and demonstrated that the Commissioner's case on the appeals before this Court did not lie outside the compass of the case run at trial. 
 Construction 

 In this Court, the Commissioner contended that s 243-20(2) is concerned neither with current contractual limitations or rights, nor with economic equivalence, but rather with "a practical capacity or ability to bring about legal limitations on legal rights" irrespective of whether there is any arrangement to which the debtor is a party (s 243-20(2)(b)). " (emphasis in original) 
 
 The phrase "arm's length", which appears in par (d) of s 243-20(2), is defined in s 995-1(1) as requiring, in any determination where parties deal at arm's length, consideration of "any connection between them and any relevant circumstance".

As the applicants submitted, [sub-s (2)] is intended to catch those arrangements which have the capacity to bring about the limitation described in [sub-s (1)]. The form of that capacity is, unsurprisingly, broad and extends, for example, to 'any arrangement to which the debtor is a party'.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 46">In the end, I accept that it is the promissory note issued under and in accordance with the terms of the Dividend Distribution Agreement which armed AFC with "funds" to pay the dividends to CSA. The rights the Dividend Distribution Agreement gives AFC for payment are not able to be impugned by the Commissioner. They might have been able to be impugned by action under s 174 of the DGCL, but they were not. There was no proceeding to suggest, let alone establish, that the dividend was paid in contravention of the DGCL: Federal Coke Company Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1977] FCA 3 ; (1977) 15 ALR 449 at 458-459, Cridland at 341 and BHP Billiton Finance Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 276 ; (2009) 72 ATR 746 at [124] , [126] and [129].
