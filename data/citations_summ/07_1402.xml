<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] AATA 273">The embryonic nature of the businesses when the Project was marketed and what occurred after 30 June 1997 is also, of course, relevant to the reasonableness of the projections contained in the IM. The Tribunal finds that the projections were not reasonable as: (a) there was no evidence of any investigation or research ever having been undertaken to substantiate the projections prior to their inclusion in the IM --- indeed, as mentioned earlier, the only evidence of a prior attempt to forecast income for the franchisees projected significantly less income than the IM forecasts (and no reason was given for the increase in the IM projections); (e) there was no evidence as to the assumptions upon which the IM projections had been made so that the experts called by the applicants had to make their own assumptions based on their industry experience; (f) the evidence of the experts called by the applicants showed that the projections in the IM were unrealistic (especially, in the absence of any plan to, for example, secure a major international broker for the IPF product or to capture by year 2 a very substantial proportion of the equipment leasing market for the Easy Rent product). 
 The franchise arrangements were not commercial 
 The Tribunal is of the view that the circumstances of these applications are entirely different to the circumstances considered by French J in Lenzo v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1402 (7 September 2007). In these applications, as already stated the Tribunal finds that there was no commercial purpose for the franchising arrangements constituted by the IPF 97 Project. The Tribunal's finding as set out above is that the sole or dominant purpose of the Project was to create a structure which would generate tax benefits to assist the Chambers Group in raising funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 50">2 The respondent Mr Gino Lenzo invested in a project (' the Project ') for growing sandalwood near Kununurra in Western Australia. Relying on Pt IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) the appellant Commissioner of Taxation disallowed most of Mr Lenzo's claimed deductions. Mr Lenzo's appeal against that decision was allowed: Lenzo v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1402. The Commissioner now appeals to the Full Court of this Court.  66 The issue in this appeal is whether the primary Judge erred in concluding that the appellant (' Commissioner ') was not entitled to disallow deductions claimed by the respondent (' Mr Lenzo ') for certain outgoings he incurred in relation to his participation in the East Kimberley Sandalwood Project No 1: Lenzo v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1402. In disallowing deductions claimed in each of the 1998, 1999 and 2000 taxation years the Commissioner relied on the provision of Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (' ITAA 1936 '). The Commissioner asserted that Mr Lenzo had obtained a tax benefit from a scheme to which Part IVA applied and that, having regard to the matters stated in s 177D(b) of the ITAA 1936, it would be concluded that Mr Lenzo entered or carried out the scheme for the dominant purpose of enabling him to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] AATA 1896">The applicants' objections claimed the outgoings as outgoings of their own businesses. Their claimed deductions are based on their own outgoings and not any net loss of the joint venture as a whole or its distribution to them, of which there is no evidence whatsoever. After the hearing the applicants' solicitors drew the Tribunal's attention to the recent decision of French J in Lenzo v Commissioner of Taxation (2007) FCA 1402 which they asserted is relevant to this matter. In the Tribunal's view the facts of that case are very different to the facts here and the decision in Lenzo has no relevance to this case. 
 PENALTIES 
 Finally there remains the question of penalties by way of additional tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] AATA 1845">Mr Lenzo had shown himself to be interested in the investment product --- sandalwood --- for over 12 months before eventually committing himself to the particular investment [138] . He had rejected earlier investment opportunities, in the same product and in the same area, because of shortcomings that he perceived in the management teams involved in them [139] . He carried out research into the Indian sandalwood industry and "read some books from his local library discussing the general nature of the product" [140] .  After I had drafted these reasons, Mr Balestra's solicitors brought to my attention the recent decision of French J in Lenzo v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1402. I was already aware of that decision but did not consider that anything said by his Honour warranted any change in my thinking in this case. Nevertheless, since it has specifically been raised, I need to explain why I hold that view. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] AATA 1800">Since the hearing the applicants' solicitors have drawn the Tribunal's attention to the recent Federal Court decision in Gino Lenzo v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1402. The Tribunal notes that the decision related to an investment in a managed timber plantation, The decision is similar in that respect to the cases of Puzey, Lau and other cases cited by the applicants and in the Tribunal's view as set out below is similarly distinguishable from the facts in this case. </sentence>
