<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 4">Where the Tribunal intends to take into account adverse information from another application in order to affirm the delegate's decision [16] s.424A is engaged [17] . In SZNKO at [9]-[12], Raphael FM considered circumstances where two types of third party information had been used: the similarity between almost identical documents, as well as inconsistencies between the applicant's evidence and that information. That discussion envisages circumstances where an obligation of disclosure under s.424A may not arise in relation to third party information. I do not think that this was such a circumstance but in any event there was disclosure pursuant to that section. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 213">The cases show that the Tribunal can rely on evidence obtained by it other than at the hearing of the particular application in question, such as confidential information: Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Kumar [2009] HCA 10 ; (2009) 238 CLR 448 ; and evidence given by another protection visa applicant in separate review proceedings: SZIAQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 654 ; MZXGB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 392. Indeed, as Hayne J said in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Jia (2001) 205 CLR 507: 
... The decision-maker, in a body like the Refugee Review Tribunal, will bring to the task of deciding an individual's application a great deal of information and ideas which have been accumulated or formed in the course of deciding other applications. A body like the Refugee Review Tribunal, unlike a court, is expected to build up "expertise" in matters such as country information. Often information of that kind is critical in deciding the fate of an individual's application ... (at 562-563 [180])
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1256">In written submissions filed by leave after the hearing, the Minister submitted that it is acceptable and appropriate for the Tribunal to use evidence given by one applicant in his or her review as information in another applicant's review. The Minister referred to cases where the Tribunal relied on evidence obtained by it other than at the hearing of the particular applicant in question, such as confidential informant information: Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Kumar [2009] HCA 10 ; (2009) 238 CLR 448 ; and evidence given by another protection visa applicant in separate review proceedings: SZIAQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 654 , MZXGB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 392. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 618">17 In similar circumstances in MZXGB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 392 at [39] - [40] Lander J rejected a contention that the Tribunal had erred by failing to consider a claim that the applicant feared persecution as a member of a particular social group comprised of business people as it was never originally part of the appellants case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 207">9 Her Honour found that the Tribunal had no obligation under s 424A of the Act to notify the appellant about its concerns regarding the credibility of her account, as this was part of its assessment of evidence or thought processes. The Federal Magistrate further noted that, as the Tribunal had "expressly disavowed reliance" on the appellant's protection visa application, there was no requirement for the Tribunal to send a s 424 letter. That material was not part of the reason for affirming the decision of the Tribunal (applying MZXGB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 392). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 2035">The Tribunal did refer to some information derived from the applicant's protection visa application but expressly disavowed reliance on it. In the decision of MZXGB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) FCA 392 at [58] , Lander J said that where the Tribunal expressly disavows reliance on particular material there is no need for the Tribunal to send a s.424A letter in relation to it. That is because the material is not part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. That statement applies to the information contained in the protection visa application. I see no basis on which this ground can be made out. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FMCA 1250">In SZGZN &amp; Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 170 at [6] and [12] per Allsop J, and MZXGB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 392 at [60] per Lander J.</sentence>
