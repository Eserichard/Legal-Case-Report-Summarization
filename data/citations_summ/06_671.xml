<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 232">As his Honour said at [92]: "The question is whether there was reason to depart from assessment of costs on the ordinary basis, and in the present case more particularly to depart to the extent of all the costs of the proceedings" . In relation to an award against a solicitor, it is appropriate to consider whether there has been "such a poor level of competence as to amount to a significant breach of duty by the practitioner" (cf. French J in Ex Christmas Islanders Association Inc v The Attorney-General for the Commonwealth (No 2) [2006] FCA 671 ; (2006) 233 ALR 97 at [2] ). I must now apply the above principles to the conduct of Mr Gabbedy in relation to his procuring a bankruptcy notice and pursuing a creditor's petition as the solicitor of a corporation which never gave him that authority. His conduct involved him holding himself out as having that authority to the Official Receiver, to this Court, to the trustee Mr Slaven whose appointment he procured, and --- not least --- to Mr Doulman who was the target of these actions.</sentence>

27 In that case his Honour found that there was a serious failure by counsel to give reasonable attention to the relevant law and facts that was reflected in both the application and the proceedings instituted in the court. In a subsequent judgment, Ex Christmas Islanders Association Inc and ors v Attorney-General (Cth) (No 2 ) [2006] FCA 671 ; (2006) 233 ALR 97 at [11] , his Honour noted the source of the court's jurisdiction to award costs against practitioners was to be found in s 43 of the Act and in O 62, r 9. His Honour stated that the power was to be exercised with care and in clear cases only in which there had been "conduct on the part of the solicitor which amounts to serious dereliction of duty" citing Da Sousa and further noting that unreasonable conduct in connection with litigation may be sufficient to justify a costs order against a practitioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FamCAFC 59">Although not referred to by either counsel, the relevant authorities about the making of a personal costs order against a legal practitioner were comprehensively discussed by French J (as his Honour then was) in Ex Christmas Islanders Association Inc and Others v Attorney-General (Cth) (No 2) [2006] FCA 671 ; (2006) 233 ALR 97. There his Honour was, not unlike this appeal, dealing with an application for a costs order based on the cost power in the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and the relevant rules of the Federal Court, not the inherent power of a court. In the discussion contained between paragraphs 9 and 25 his Honour referred to a number of cases and we would respectfully adopt the principles as extracted by him from those cases. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCAFC 172">15 There are two bases upon which the Court may make an order for costs personally against a legal practitioner. The first is s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). An example of the exercise of this discretion is to be seen in the case of Ex Christmas Islanders Association Inc v Attorney-General (Cth) (No 2) [2006] FCA 671 ; (2007) 233 ALR 97 , where French J (as he then was) required that a barrister and solicitor pay the Commonwealth's costs personally.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 61">In Ex Christmas Islanders Association Inc v The Attorney-General for the Commonwealth (No 2) [2006] FCA 671 ; (2006) 233 ALR 97 French J referred to the approach of the Privy Council in Harley v McDonald in considering the power of the Federal Court to award costs against legal practitioners under s.43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and O.62 r.9. However what was in issue in Ex Christmas Islanders Association Inc was whether a lawyer had proceeded without any prospects of success. His Honour found that the preparation and presentation of an application for judicial review "was done at such a poor level of competence as to amount to a significant breach of duty of the practitioner" (at [1] --- [2]) to the client and the Court and warranted the making of an order for costs against the lawyer personally. There was said to be a failure to discharge a legal practitioner's "basic duty" to give proper consideration to the legal issues that should have been considered before the application was filed and argument presented (at [21]). The Privy Council was said to have adopted a " careful and discriminating approach" to the circumstances in which a costs order should be made in that context. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] FCA 1352">In Ex Christmas Islanders Association Inc v The Attorney-General for the Commonwealth (No 2) [2006] FCA 671 at [20] French J pointed out that the power to award costs against a legal practitioner has been approached in different ways by State appellate courts and Full Courts of this Court as exemplified in Levick v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 674 ; (2000) 102 FCR 155 (under provisions such as s 43 of the Federal Court Act and O 62 r 9 of the Federal Court Rules ). He reasoned that considerations of whether legal practitioners should be ordered to pay costs under the provisions governing this Court's jurisdiction depended upon whether there had been an error in the observation by a legal practitioner of a duty owed to the Court. French J followed the approach of the Privy Council in Harley v McDonald [2001] UKPC 18 ; [2001] UKPC 18 ; [2001] 2 AC 678 at 706 [57] where their Lordships said: 
 
 'The essential point is that it is not errors of judgment that attract the exercise of the jurisdiction, but errors of a duty owed to the court. ' (see also at [2001] 2 AC at 703 [49], 706 [57]; and Cook v Pasminco Ltd [2001] FCA 1277 per Stone J and, the article by N Beaumont, 'What are "Reasonable Prospects of Success?
