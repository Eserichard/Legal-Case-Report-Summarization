<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 256">I have previously warned against the Tribunal taking a preconceived adverse view about the claims of applicants who are represented by agents with a poor reputation. [27] The applicant (understandably) did not submit that the reputation of his agent was so bad that no one represented by him could ever obtain a fair hearing before the Tribunal. It is difficult to know what the true complaint is, but the applicant would be misconceived if he were to argue that a thorough and forthright testing of his factual claims constitutes and apprehension of bias [28] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 38">In Richardson v Leonard Cohen &amp; Co [2008] FCA 308 at [13] - [14]: [13] The Court will not go behind a judgment as a matter of course, but where a judgment is obtained by default the Court in bankruptcy will more readily look behind the judgment than it would if the judgment were obtained following a hearing on the merits: Wolff v Donovan [1991] FCA 222 ; (1991) 29 FCR 480 at 486 per Lee and Hill JJ. At 487 their Honours said: [T]he true position is that there is a shifting onus. Once the judgment is proved, and it is prima facie evidence of the existence of the underlying debt, there is a tactical onus on the debtor to show that there are circumstances which make it appropriate to go behind the debt to see whether the judgment was in truth and reality a true debt. The overall onus of proof of the existence of a real debt underlying a judgment, however, remains always with the petitioning creditor. [14] It is not necessary for a Respondent debtor to prove that they are not, in truth and reality, indebted to the petitioning creditor. All that is required of a Respondent debtor was to show that there was "substantial reason for questioning whether there is ... a debt": Joosse v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 245 ; [2004] FCAFC 245 ; (2004) 137 FCR 576 at 579 [6] per North and Finkelstein JJ. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 156">It is important to note that SZBEL involved the first and only review by the Tribunal of the delegate's decision not, as here, a second review by a reconstituted Tribunal where the first Tribunal had made findings and come to conclusions on the issues it thought arose in relation to the decision under review. In SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 168 FCR 1 ; [2008] FCA 390 (" SZDFZ "), Flick J considered the obligation under s 425 of the Act where this occurs, that is, where a second or reconstituted Tribunal is conducting a review of a delegate's decision after the first Tribunal's decision has been set aside. About this situation, his Honour observed (at [19]): 
 
 First, it is not considered that "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review" are to be defined in all cases by the decision of the delegate. ... The issues which a delegate considers dispositive of the application may well be the issues which an applicant has to confront and answer when an appeal is lodged with the tribunal, eg SZJKU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 308 at [37] ---[45] per Emmett J. But the object of s 425 is to ensure that an applicant is given an opportunity "to give evidence and present arguments", being evidence and argument "relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review". And that is an obligation imposed upon the tribunal hearing the application before it, whether it be the tribunal initially hearing the application or any subsequent tribunal. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 400">Ms Clegg, however, while noting the applicant's submission that focussed on the word "might" (as in might not bring an open mind), submitted that Mr Jones did not also focus on the hypothetical lay observer being a reasonable person. A point supported by other authorities on which the Minister relied (see Ex parte H at 434-5, Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 179 ALR 296 at [15] and per Kirby J at [53] --- [65] and [89] --- [95], NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 per Allsop J at [21], and SZJKU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 308 per Emmett J at [36]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 333">The submission was, in the broad, that where apprehended bias has been upheld, this usually involves some criticism of the Tribunal's reasoning. That is, it is either irrational, unreasonable or capricious (see NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 (" NADH ") per Allsop J), or there is something about the conduct of the Tribunal, for example arising from the transcript of the hearing, that supports the proposition that a fair minded lay observer would conclude as to the possibility that the Tribunal had come to the review with a closed mind. (See also SZJKU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 308 (" SZJKU ") per Emmett J at [36]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 431">The Federal Magistrate correctly laid out the test of whether a fair minded lay observer would apprehend bias on the part of the Tribunal requires something more than a feeling that conventions of discretion and prudence have been breached. Something more is required and the apprehension must be firmly established: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 179 ALR 296 ( Epeabaka ), at [15]; and at [53] --- [65], [89] --- [95]. The test is an objective test, viewed through the eyes of the reasonable or fair minded lay observer: NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 ( NADH ), at [21]; SZJKU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 308 , at [36]. Robust and forthright testing of the appellant's claims by the Tribunal does not sustain a finding of apprehended bias. Indeed, displays of robust individuality may at times be expected from persons charged with the difficult task of making decisions of this nature: Epeabaka at [90]; NADH at [19]. It is for the Tribunal to get to the truth of the matter and it is proper for the Tribunal to focus an applicant's mind: Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 , at 435 [30]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 294">Nor does vigorous questioning or testing of an applicant's evidence at a hearing, on its own, reveal bias on the part of the Tribunal, or give rise to an apprehension of bias ( Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 at [31] ). Nor is there any evidence of any imprudent or intemperate comments or observations by the Tribunal ( SZJKU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 308 per Emmett J at [36]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 361">There are a number of matters that must be noted here. First, as I have already said, that an allegation of bias is a very serious matter, and as has often been said by the Courts, one that should not be lightly made. It requires evidence in support before it can be made out (see SZHPD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 157 at [22] ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia (2001) 205 CLR 507 ; [2001] HCA 17 at [69] ). It is the case that it is difficult to make out bias if all that an applicant seeks to rely on is the Tribunal's decision record ( SZJKU v Minster for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 308 at [35] - [36] , per Emmett J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 92">Flick J when dealing with a case that had been before a previously constituted Tribunal in SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 390 at [19] said: 
 
 "First, it is not considered that "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review" are to be defined in all cases by the decision of the delegate. Their Honours in SZBEL did observe " But if the Tribunal takes no step to identify some issue other than those that the delegate considered dispositive, and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is, the applicant is entitled to assume that the issues the delegate considered dispositive are "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review" ... The issues which a delegate considers dispositive of the application may well be the issues which an applicant has to confront and answer when an appeal is lodged with the tribunal, eg SZJKU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 308 at [37] ---[45] per Emmett J. But the object of s.425 is to ensure that an applicant is given an opportunity "to give evidence and present arguments ", being evidence and argument " relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review" . And that is an obligation imposed upon the tribunal hearing the application before it, whether it be the tribunal initially hearing the application or any subsequent tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] HCASL 425">We see no reason to doubt the conclusion of Emmett J that what was said in the course of the proceedings, even if characterised as "imprudent or intemperate" did not demonstrate actual bias and was not such as "would cause a fair minded lay person properly informed of the nature of the proceeding ... to reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question before it" [1] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 390">19 First, it is not considered that " the issues arising in relation to the decision under review " are to be defined in all cases by the decision of the delegate. Their Honours in SZBEL did observe:
 
 ... But if the Tribunal takes no step to identify some issue other than those that the delegate considered dispositive, and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is, the applicant is entitled to assume that the issues the delegate considered dispositive are "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"....
 

 The issues which a delegate considers dispositive of the application may well be the issues which an applicant has to confront and answer when an appeal is lodged with the tribunal, eg SZJKU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 308 at [37] ---[45] per Emmett J. But the object of s 425 is to ensure that an applicant is given an opportunity " to give evidence and present arguments ", being evidence and argument " relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review ". And that is an obligation imposed upon the tribunal hearing the application before it, whether it be the tribunal initially hearing the application or any subsequent tribunal. </sentence>
