<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 751">It is agreed that Mr Merhi acted 'under a misapprehension' as to the legal conditions attaching to the officials' right of entry, presumably, in relation to the aspects which I have emphasised above. That is, that the union officials held State and Commonwealth authorisations which allowed them to enter the site without prior notice, and without being required to explain and justify their entry. The admission of liability to penalty, implies that his misapprehension occurred in circumstances which did not allow him a defence of honest and reasonable mistake, assuming its applicability (see Dalzell v Ferguson (supra) at 402-407, Australian Federation of Air Pilots v Australian Airlines Ltd (1991) 28 FCR 360 at 374-376, Tran v The Commonwealth [2009] FCA 474 at [37] , and Dimella Constructions Pty Ltd v Stocker and Stocker (1976) 14 SASR 215). </sentence>

 The Court orders that: 1. The application be dismissed. The Court declares that: 
 
 1. Title in the ship with the markings Hao Kiet BL91693TS passed to the Commonwealth on and from 1 July 2003 and all rights and title to that ship were vested in the Commonwealth on and from 1 July 1993. 
 

The primary judge's reasons are set out in Tran v The Commonwealth [2008] FCA 901 ("Tran No 1") and Tran v The Commonwealth [2009] FCA 474 ("Tran No 2").</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 921">Cowdroy J dismissed Mr Tran's claim for compensation at first instance ( Tran v The Commonwealth (2008) 103 ALD 290 ; [2008] FCA 901 ( Tran No 1 ); Tran v The Commonwealth (2009) 108 ALD 531 ; [2009] FCA 474 ( Tran No 2 )). The principal basis upon which his Honour did so in Tran No 2 turned on the construction of ss 261A and 42 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). Section 261A(1)(a) of the Migration Act provides for forfeiture to the Commonwealth of a vessel used or involved in a contravention of the Act (where the contravention occurred in Australia), if the contravention involved: (i) the bringing or coming to Australia of one or more persons who were, or upon entry into Australia became, unlawful non-citizens; or (ii) the entry or proposed entry into Australia of one or more such persons. Section 42(1) provides that a non-citizen must not travel to Australia without a visa that is in effect. </sentence>
