<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] FCA 1702">8 The respondents were represented, on the hearing of the winding up application, by Norman Carey their common director who was given leave to represent them. Mr Carey had applied to strike out the application in August 2006 on the basis that it was invalid for failure to comply with s 459Q of the Act which requires verification, by affidavit, of the currency of the debts at the time of the making of the application. On 16 August 2001 that motion was dismissed --- Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Eastlands Pty Ltd (No 1) [2006] FCA 1101. Other interlocutory orders refusing leave to issue certain subpoenas and requiring ASIC to provide a list of documents in its possession relevant to the question of solvency were made on the same day --- Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Eastlands Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1193. </sentence>
