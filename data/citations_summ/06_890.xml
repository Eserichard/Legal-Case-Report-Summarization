<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCAFC 188">16 The appellant disavowed a bias or apprehended bias contention. Rather he challenges the primary judge's refusal to disqualify himself on the ground that he had heard an earlier case in which the appellant was a party: Rana v Australian Federal Police [2006] FCA 890. His Honour's reasons in that case do not disclose any adverse credit findings against the appellant that would have required him to disqualify himself from hearing the case under appeal. The appellant's appeal to the Full Court was dismissed. Grounds of appeal claiming bias and lack of procedural fairness on the primary judge's part were rejected. See Rana v Australian Federal Police [2006] FCAFC 169.
