<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 572">I turn now to consider whether settlement of the proceeding ought to be approved under s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act . The relevant principles are now well settled: see, for example, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258 per Branson J; Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4 ) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2000) 180 ALR 459 at 465-6 [19] per Goldberg J; Neil v P &amp; O Cruises Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1325 at [6] - [7] per Weinberg J; Jarrama Pty Ltd v Caltex Australia Petroleum Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1114 at [10] per Crennan J; Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (No 5) [2004] FCA 1406 ; (2004) 212 ALR 311 at 317-8 [37] - [42] per Sackville J; Crawford v Bank of Western Australia Ltd [2005] FCA 949 at [16] - [21] per Lee J; Georgiou v Old England Hotel Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 705 at [18] per Young J; Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1388 ; (2006) 236 ALR 322 at 332 [30] and [31] per Jessup J; and Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 897 at [17] --- [20] per Gordon J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 897">17 In assessing a compromise under s 33V of the Act , the Court's task is an onerous one particularly in circumstances such as the present where the application is unoppossed: see Lopez v Star World Enterprises Pty Ltd (in liq) [1999] FCA 104 ; (1999) ATPR 41-678 at [16] . The Court is required:
 
(1) to assess whether the proposed settlement or compromise is fair and reasonable and adequate having regard to the claims made on behalf of the group members who will be bound by the settlement: see Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2000) 180 ALR 459 at [19] ; and
 
(2) " to be satisfied that any settlement or discontinuance of representative proceedings has been undertaken in the interests of the group members as a whole, and not just in the interests of the applicant and the respondent ": Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258; Lopez v Star World Enterprises Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 104 ; [1999] ATPR 41-678 at [15] and Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (No 2) (2007) ATPR 42-134 at [30] and [31]. See also Neil v P &amp; O Cruises Australia Pty Ltd (formerly P &amp; O Holidays Ltd) [2002] FCA 1325 (Weinberg J) at [6] ---[7]; Jarrama Pty Ltd v Caltex Australia Petroleum Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1114 (Crennan J) at [10]; Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (No 5) [2004] FCA 1406 ; (2004) 212 ALR 311 (Sackville J) at [37] ---[42]) and Georgiou v Old England Hotel Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 705 at [18] (Young J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1388">It is true that the judgment of Goldberg J in Williams has been referred to on a number of occasions by members of the court when exercising jurisdiction under s 33V. To the instances referred by the applicants as set out above may be added the judgment of Young J in Georgiou v Old England Hotel Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 705 , [18]. In none of these cases (including the two Victorian ones referred to), however, does one find a practical elaboration of what it is about a particular settlement, or about settlements in general, that make it, or them, 'fair and reasonable'. Further, although Goldberg J referred to a series of matters which the court would ordinarily take into account, subsequent judgments of the court under s 33V do not disclose any pattern of systematic consideration of such matters in the way, for example, of a check-list. In practice, every case is dealt with on its own merits, and by reference to specific factors which might raise serious doubts as to fairness and the like. </sentence>
