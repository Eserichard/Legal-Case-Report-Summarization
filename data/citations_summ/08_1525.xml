<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1757">6 I did not deal with the applicants' notice of motion of 5 September 2008 and on 14 October 2008 I dismissed the appeal as incompetent. All Districts Coating Pty Ltd v Barhoum [2008] FCA 1525. 
  5 On 18 April 2008, the applicants filed a notice of appeal in this Court, that is, after the Federal Magistrate made the first set of orders on 22 February 2008 (that were revised on 28 March 2008) but before the Federal Magistrate made the second set of orders on 11 July 2008. The orders made by the Federal Magistrate on 22 February 2008 (revised on 28 March 2008) were interlocutory (see All Districts Coating Pty Ltd v Barhoum [2008] FCA 1525) , and hence leave to appeal should have been sought: s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Indeed, when the matter was first before the Court, the question was raised about the applicants filing, in addition to the notice of appeal, an application for leave to appeal. The applicants did not take the step of applying for leave to appeal but sought to defend the institution of the appeal on the basis that the orders appealed from were final. The respondents filed a notice of motion, dated 23 May 2008, seeking that the notice of appeal be stuck out as incompetent. On 3 June 2008, I reserved my decision on the question of whether the appeal was incompetent. Meanwhile, on 5 September 2008 the applicants filed a notice of motion (that was amended on 2 October 2008) seeking to amend the notice of appeal to embrace the Federal Magistrate's further orders of 11 July 2008. </sentence>
