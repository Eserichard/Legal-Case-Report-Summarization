<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] QCA 59">See, for example, Westpac Banking Corporation v Totterdell (1998) 20 WAR 150 at 154; Re Federation Health Ltd (Administrator Appointed) [2006] FCA 314 at [34] ; Re Galaxy Media Pty Ltd (Recs and Mgrs apptd) (in liq) v Andrew (as Liq of Galaxy Media) &amp; Ors [2001] NSWSC 917 per Santow J. That said, the proceedings remained, however, a challenge to the liquidator's decision so that the onus was on Mr Labaj to establish his claim: Westpac Banking Corporation v Totterdell; [2] Re Federation Health Ltd (Administrator Appointed) [3] and Re Galaxy Media Pty Limited (Recs and Mgrs apptd) (in liq) v Andrew (as Liq of Galaxy Media) and Ors.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1530">42 The appeal process has been described in an analogous but not identical context as "originating proceedings which the Court hears de novo" --- Tanning Research Industries Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 at 339 (Brennan and Dawson JJ). The context in that case was an appeal against rejection by a liquidator of a proof of debt. It was applied to the characterisation of the proceedings in that case and has been applied to like proceedings under s 1321 involving an appeal against an administrator's rejection of a proof of debt: In The Matter of Federation Health Ltd (Administrator Appointed) [2006] FCA 314 at [32] --- [36] (Young J), citing also Re North Sydney District Rugby League Football Club [2000] NSWSC 634 ; (2000) 34 ACSR 630 at 631 [3] (Bryson J) and Brodyn Pty Ltd v Dasein Constructions Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1230 at [29] - [33] (Young CJ). See also Westpac Banking Corporation v Totterdell (1997) 25 ACSR 769 in which Templeman J said (at 772): 
 
 'I understand a hearing de novo in this context to be one in which the parties are not bound by the evidence at the previous hearing, but may supplement it as they think fit ... But despite the admission of further evidence, the onus remains with the party who challenges the decision. ' </sentence>
