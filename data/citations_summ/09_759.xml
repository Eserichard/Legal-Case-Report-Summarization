<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 803">I heard this matter in Darwin on 25 and 26 March 2009. Soon after I reserved my decision in this matter, two judges delivered three decisions on similar and, in some cases, identical, factual and legal issues. They were: SS v Australian Crime Commission (2009) 256 ALR 474 ; [2009] FCA 580 (" SS ") per Jagot J, delivered on 29 May 2009; AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission (2009) 178 FCR 171 ; [2009] FCA 642 (" AA1 ") per Besanko J, delivered on 22 June 2009; and GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759 (" GG ") per Besanko J, delivered on 20 July 2009. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 63"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 553">After the hearing of these proceedings had concluded, the Full Court (Downes, Jessup and Tracey JJ) delivered judgment in the appeal from the decision of Besanko J in GG [2009] FCA 759 ( GG v Australian Crime Commission [2010] FCAFC 15 ; (2010) 182 FCR 513). Although the appeal was allowed, the Full Court agreed with the conclusions which Besanko J had reached in respect of the point presently under consideration. The observations of the Full Court are directly in point in principle and also on the facts. The meeting under consideration in GG v Australian Crime Commission was the very same meeting of the Board of the ACC held on 25 June 2008 which is under challenge in the present proceedings. However, no issue estoppel arises because the person named as "GG" in GG [2010] FCAFC 15 ; 182 FCR 513 is not the same person named as "GG" in proceeding NSD 460 of 2009.  It was also submitted that, in any event, his Honour was correct in the views which he expressed in AA [2009] FCA 642 and in GG [2009] FCA 759.  As Flick J observed in AB Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 ; (2009) 175 FCR 296 (AB) at [54] , an observation that was endorsed by this Court in NTD8 at [73], "[t]hose against whom the powers conferred by the 2002 Act are exercised are entitled to have confidence that the power is being lawfully invoked". In NTD8, as here, the Statement of Reasons, the Statement of Facts and Circumstances and the Legal Submissions in Support were formulaic and uninformative and did not focus attention on the specific considerations to which the Examiner had regard. Again they seem to bear the hallmarks of a standard form document (see the observations of this Court in NTD8 at [34]; Flick J in AB at [54] and Besanko J in GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759 at [51] ). However, deficiencies of this nature will not necessarily invalidate a notice: see, for example, AB at [59] per Flick J and SS v ACC [2009] FCA 580 at [97] per Jagot J. 
And at [96], the Court said:
 As to the purpose of the reasons, the appellant's essential point was that although the legislation does not provide specifically for a right to reasons for the decision, such a right should be implied by reason of the existence of the right to judicial review of the decision, the terms of s 29(1A) itself, and the requirements of s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act . This argument was accepted by Besanko J in AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 642 and in GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759. In the former case, at [62]---[64], his Honour said: The applicant submits that s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act is not engaged by s 7B(3) and s 7E of the ACC Act because the reference to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in s 7B(3) is not a mention or reference to a person holding or occupying a particular office or position in general terms. The submission is that a mention or reference in an Act to, for example, a director of a company or an officer of an organisation would be a mention or reference in general terms, but a mention or reference to an office occupied by one person is not a mention or reference in general terms . For the reasons given by all the judges in GG [2009] FCA 759 and GG [2010] FCAFC 15 ; 182 FCR 513 (both at trial and on appeal) , the present applicants' challenge to the validity of the resolution of the Board of the ACC made on 14 June 2007 which authorised the 2007 Determination and their challenge to the validity of the resolution of that Board made on 25 June 2008 which authorised the 2008 Determination both fail. It also follows that the applicants' contentions that both the 2007 Determination and the 2008 Determination were not valid authorisations and determinations in writing for the purposes of ss 7C(1)(c), 7C(1)(d) and 7C(3) of the Act must also be rejected. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCAFC 15"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCAFC 4">90 It should also be noted that in AB counsel for the ACC conceded that the content of the obligation in s 29(1A) was informed by s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) (which obliges a decision-maker required to give written reasons for a decision to "set out the findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based"). In this case the respondents made no such concession but asserted --- correctly in our opinion --- that s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act was not engaged by the obligation under s 29(1A) since that requires the examiner to record, but not to 'give', written reasons for the decision. That this is the correct approach is confirmed by decisions about the analogous provision in s 28(1A) of the Act: see Barnes v Boulton [2004] FCA 1219 ; (2004) 139 FCR 356 ; SS v ACC [2009] FCA 580 at [90] ; AA v Board of the ACC [2009] FCA 642 at [30] ; GG v ACC [2009] FCA 759 at [45] .  89 We agree that the sufficiency of the Statement of Reasons was open to criticism. The appellant was correct to draw attention to what counsel described as the 'formulae approach' of the reasons and to the importance of observing the requirements of s 29(1A). As Flick J observed in AB Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 ; (2009) 175 FCR 296 ( AB ) at [54], an observation that was endorsed by this Court in NTD8 at [73], "[t]hose against whom the powers conferred by the 2002 Act are exercised are entitled to have confidence that the power is being lawfully invoked". In NTD8 , as here, the Statement of Reasons, the Statement of Facts and Circumstances and the Legal Submissions in Support were formulaic and uninformative and did not focus attention on the specific considerations to which the Examiner had regard. Again they seem to bear the hallmarks of a standard form document (see the observations of this Court in NTD8 at [34]; Flick J in AB at [54] and Besanko J in GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759 at [51] ). However, deficiencies of this nature will not necessarily invalidate a notice: see, for example, AB at [59] per Flick J and SS v ACC [2009] FCA 580 at [97] per Jagot J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1027">Yet SS's construction would require the CEO to give written notice of the cancellation of the notation to persons both served or otherwise given the summons or notice by the ACC and persons (unknown to the CEO) to whom such a person made disclosure (and so on in accordance with s 29B(4)). 
 
 
 
 
 These considerations indicate that the ACC's submission must be accepted. " 
 

 
(See also GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759 at [34] - [37]. )
  As to the former submission, a similar submission was made and rejected by me in GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759. I said (at [31]): 
 
 "The first ground of challenge to the second summons is that it failed to state that the applicant was required to give evidence as a "witness". It is submitted that the second summons was therefore deficient "on its face".</sentence>
