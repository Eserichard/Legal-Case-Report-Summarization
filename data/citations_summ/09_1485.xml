<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1438">It is not necessary to deal with this objection in order to dispose of this appeal. There can be no doubt that the AAT is required to accord procedural fairness to those appearing before it but authority is divided as to whether a failure to do so (at least where the failure must be established by resort to material other than that provided to the Court pursuant to s 46 of the AAT Act) can give rise to a question of law for the purposes of s 44: see, for example, Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 ; (2003) 131 FCR 28 at 31-2; 46-7. Similarly, it is by no means clear that a failure, by the AAT, to provide adequate reasons for its decision gives rise to reviewable error of law: see Kennedy v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2009] FCA 1485 ; (2009) 182 FCR 411 at 431-6. Unless a relevant ground exists, it will be difficult to identify a related question of law: see Birdseye at 325. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 108">54 The Court's function is, of course, to review decisions for jurisdictional error, and not to review reasons. There may be cases where what appears on the face of the Tribunal's reasons to be a jurisdictional error is shown by the record before the reviewing court to be merely a failure to comply with s 430. Such a failure does not constitute jurisdictional error. In the case of a failure to comply with s 430 , the appropriate course for an aggrieved applicant is to seek an order compelling the Tribunal to comply with its obligations under s 430. The ensuing written statement may or may not reveal jurisdictional error: cf Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 (' Ex parte Palme ') at 224-25 [41]-[46] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ; and Kennedy v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2009] FCA 1485 ; (2009) 182 FCR 411 at 435 [70] per Tracey J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] NSWSC 774">108 The insurer contended that in essence Mr Sanhueza was submitting that the Tribunal had given inadequate reasons. The insurer relied on the decisions in Minister for Immigration v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [4] --- [10] per Gleeson CJ and [68] --- [69] (per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ); Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex Parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at [55] , [57] and [41]; and Kennedy v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2009] FCA 1485 at [55] --- [75] (Tracey J). Reference was also made to VAW at [94] --- [116]. Yusuf and Palme were immigration cases.</sentence>
