<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] TASSC 31">At 171, his Honour said:
 
 
 "I would therefore dispose of this case on the simple ground that Parliament has not said that this commission is entitled to fix a quorum and make a decision of that quorum the decision of the Commission, and that so far from being necessary to imply such a power for the effective functioning of the Commission it would, in my view, be contrary to the legislative purpose for the court to do so. " 
 
 39 Notwithstanding the relevance given to the nature of the make-up of the body in question, this case has been taken as authority for the proposition expressed in Green v R (above). The general rule remains that in the absence of any provision for a quorum, all members of a statutory body or a body with delegated powers, need to be present in order to make a valid decision; see Hedges v Australasian Conference Association Ltd [2003] NSWSC 1107 , Carruthers v Connolly [1998] 1 Qd R 339 at 386 --- 387, and (more generally), Ball v Pearsall (1987) 10 NSWLR 700 at 703, In the matter of Professional Golfers Association of Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 1571 at [27] . Conclusions 
 40 The question then is whether it has been shown that the Council approved of the Committee exercising its delegated functions with a quorum of two. To re-cap, the appellant says that the number to make-up the Committee was three, that it could not function with two because no quorum had been provided for, and the operation of the Acts Interpretation Act , s23C , does not arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 428">31 Because MBF is a company limited by guarantee and does not have a share capital, the statutory majority required by s 411(4)(a)(ii)(B) of the Act, a majority of 75% of votes cast, does not apply in the case of the Scheme. Consequently, it is sufficient for the purposes of s 411(4)(a)(ii) that the Scheme is agreed to by a bare majority in number of the members present and voting (either in person or by proxy): see, for example, Re Credit Reference Association of Australia Ltd (unreported, Sup Ct of NSW, Santow J, 4 February 1998) and, more recently, Re Professional Golfers Association of Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 1571 and Professional Golfers' Association of Australia Ltd v New Golf Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 2072. This arises from the definition of "Part 5.1 body" (to which s 411 applies) in s 9 of the Corporations Act to mean, inter alia, "a company", and the definition in s 9 of "company" to mean a company registered under the Corporations Act (a company may be registered under the Corporations Act as a company limited by guarantee --- see s 112(1) of the Corporations Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 2072">1 On 9 October 2007 I directed each plaintiff to convene a meeting of its members for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, agreeing (with or without modification) to a proposed scheme of arrangement between that plaintiff and its members: see In the matter of Professional Golfers Association of Australia Limited [2007] FCA 1571. </sentence>
