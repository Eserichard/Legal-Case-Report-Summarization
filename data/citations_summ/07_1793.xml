<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1196">Moreover no lack of procedural fairness has been otherwise established. Insofar as the applicant intended to raise an allegation of actual or apprehended bias, that is not made out on the material before the Court. The Tribunal considered the request that the photocopied unsigned letter be submitted for expert examination and addressed the issue in its reasons for decision, but reached the conclusion, for reasons that were open to it on the material before it, that it was not satisfied that any " meaningful observations " could reasonably be expected in relation to a document of the nature of the letter in question or that there was any useful purpose to be served by submitting it for further examination. It did not dismiss this (or the loan document) " in a summary fashion without any proper consideration" (cf Applicant M164 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 16 at [118] ). Such an approach is neither indicative of a closed mind (see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 ; [2001] HCA 17) or such as to give rise to an apprehension of bias from the perspective of the appropriately informed lay observer (see Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H (2001) 75 ALJR 982; [2001] HCA 28 ). For the sake of completeness I note that this is not a case in which the applicant was led to believe that tendering the original of the JTMM letter would not advance his case (so that it could be said that the applicant was denied a fair hearing because an original document could have been investigated as to its authenticity) as considered in Applicant S298/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2009) 99 ALD 25 ; [2007] FCA 1793 at [47] --- [50] per Lander J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 825">The applicant appealed. On 22 nd November 2007 Lander J allowed the appeal, quashed the Tribunal decision and remitted the application to the Tribunal for review according to law. [8] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 98">The Applicant also refers to and relies upon the decision of Rares J in SZJYA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2) [2008] FCA 911 and the decision of Lander J in Applicant S298/2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1793. However, the factual circumstances in those cases are far removed from those in the present case. </sentence>
