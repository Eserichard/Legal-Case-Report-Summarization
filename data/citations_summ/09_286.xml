<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] HCA 40">The circumstances giving rise to the present appeal are, as Ryan J noted [36] , quite different from the authorities [37] dealing with "self-education expenses". In those cases the taxpayer carried on a business, or was already in employment, to which the studies related. The prospect of the future employment of the respondent as a teacher was not the basis on which her education expenses have been held to be deductible. Rather, the question is whether the occasion of her expenses was productive of her "passive income" [38] , in the form of youth allowance, and assessable on the basis of the reasoning in Dixon and Keily .
  The Commissioner of Taxation ("the Commissioner") maintains that such expenses are not deductible by the recipient of a youth allowance under s 8-1 of the 1997 Act . The Commissioner disallowed the deduction of $920, and later disallowed an objection by the respondent against the amended assessment issued to her. The respondent unsuccessfully sought review of the Commissioner's decision in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, her application to the Federal Court (Ryan J) to "appeal" against the decision of the Tribunal was successful [2] . Thereafter, the Full Court (Finn, Sundberg and Edmonds JJ) dismissed an appeal by the Commissioner against the decision of Ryan J [3] .
  Essential to the inquiry of deductibility is the identification of that which is productive of the assessable income [41] . To put it another way, one must ask how the assessable income was (or was expected to be) gained or produced. Contrary to what the Full Court said, the respondent was not "paid to undertake [study]" [42] and that was not required to be so for the deductions to be allowable. Rather, as Ryan J said [43] , the assessable youth allowance income received by the respondent was gained or produced by her entitlement to that payment consequent on the determination by the Secretary that she qualified for the payment. That statutory right to payment [44] would be retained by her, without reduction, non-payment, suspension or cancellation, so long as she maintained her qualification for the payment by satisfying the activity test by undertaking full-time study so defined.
