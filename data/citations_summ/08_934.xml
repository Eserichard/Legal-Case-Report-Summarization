<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 94">In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; 66 IPR 131 I rejected a contention that s 101(3) required the party seeking the exercise of the discretion to show "exceptional circumstances". Flick J arrived at the same conclusion in E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 ; (2008) 77 IPR 69 at [198] which was not overturned by the Full Court on the appeal. So also did Bennett J in Pioneer Computers Australia Pty Ltd v Pioneer KK [2009] FCA 135 ; 176 FCR 300 at [168] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 39">In Pioneer Computers , Bennett J at [169] succinctly stated the principles arising from Hermes and adopted by Flick J in E &amp; J Gallo Winery as follows: 
 
 In E &amp; J Gallo [2008] FCA 934 ; 77 IPR 69 at [202] - [203], Flick J stated that the following factors set out by Falconer J in Hermes Trade Mark [1982] RPC 425 were of assistance in considering the exercise of the discretion: 
 
 there had been no abandonment of the trade mark; the registered proprietors of the mark still had a residual reputation in the mark; there had been sales by the registered proprietors of goods for which removal was sought since the relevant period ended; the applicants for removal had entered the market without having taken steps to ascertain from the Register whether anyone had a right to exclude their use of the mark; the registered proprietors were not aware of the applicant's sales under the mark.  The discretion is unlimited: see Pioneer Computers Australia Pty Ltd v Pioneer KK [2009] FCA 135 ; (2009) 176 FCR 300 at [167] , [172] and [173]. Further, it is unnecessary to demonstrate that ' exceptional circumstances exist before the discretion may be exercised in favour of the holder of the trademark ': see Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; (2005) 66 IPR 131 at [98] ; Pioneer Computers at [168]; E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 008 596 370) [2008] FCA 934 ; (2008) 77 IPR 69 at [198] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1380">In E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd (2008) 77 IPR 69 ; [2008] FCA 934 Flick J at [193]-[213] considered the principles that should inform the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 101(3). In light of his Honour's analysis in that case, it is not necessary for me to set out a detailed discussion of those principles. I would note, however, that as Flick J observed (at [198]), the discretion conferred by s 101(3) is unlike the discretion involved in, say, removal actions formerly brought under s 23 of the repealed Act (see also Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd v N V Organon (2005) 223 ALR 27 ; [2005] FCA 1282 at [97] - [98]). Significantly, the discretion under s 101(3) is not conditioned on the need to establish "exceptional circumstances" before the discretion can be exercised favourably to the trade mark owner. However, as s 101(3) makes clear, the Court (or the Registrar, as the case might be) may only decide that the trade mark should not be removed from the Register "if satisfied that it is reasonable to do so". This requires, in my view, the Court (or the Registrar) to be positively satisfied of that condition. In my view it is the opponent for removal who bears the burden of persuasion on that issue. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] ATMO 102">The choice of forum and grounds for this matter are thus inappropriate. In Edwards v Liquid Engineering 2003 Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 970 Gordon J stated at paragraph 8: 
Having considered the evidence led, and submissions made, I was poised to answer that question in the affirmative and uphold the appeal, on the basis that "good faith" for the purposes of s 92(4) requires no more than genuine intent to use a mark for commercial purposes; it does not involve any element of honesty or subjective good intentions: see generally E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 at [187] - [192] (examining the meaning of "good faith" under related provisions of the TMA). However, during the course of the hearings it became apparent that what LE 2003 really wanted, and should have applied for in the first place, was the expungement of the registrations by Edwards under s 88 of the TMA on the basis that Edwards was not the owner of the unregistered marks: ss 52 and 58 of the TMA. I therefore delayed giving judgment in VID 934 of 2006 so that a separate application could be brought on that basis and the matters resolved together. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] ATMO 94">He emphasized the discretion is no longer constrained by any requirement to establish "exceptional circumstances": E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 934 at paragraph 198. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] ATMO 65">It is questionable whether or not this evidence goes to the 'good faith' of the opponent, given the interpretation of the expression by the Federal Court. Mr. Ziehlke referred to previous decisions of the Registrar including Bunter v Hoborama LLC [13] and Edwards v Liquid Engineering [14] . However, the interpretation of the expression 'in good faith' favoured in those decisions before the Registrar have been superseded by the comments in the Federal Court appeal to the latter case [15] , where it was said (emphasis added):

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 664">I accept, as Sports Warehouse contended, that a sign may be registrable as a trade mark even though it is used together with another trade mark, and that there can still be use of a mark where it is a component of a larger composite mark: see Chocolaterie Guylian at 93 [97]; also E &amp; J Gallo Winery at 662 [68]-[69]; also E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 ; [2008] FCA 934 ; (2008) 77 IPR 69 at 108 [186] (Flick J). Colorado Group Ltd v Strandbags Group Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 184 ; (2007) 74 IPR 246 (' Colorado ') is not authority for the contrary proposition. Each case turns on its own facts and the trade mark in question viewed in the context of those facts. In Colorado Allsop J held that on the facts of that case the significant use as a trade mark was use as a composite mark and that there was no relevant use of the word "COLORADO" as a separate mark: 273 [110] (Allsop J); see also 225 [36] per Gyles J. Where an application for registration relies on use, the question is whether the particular sign for which registration is sought has itself been used as a trade mark so as to become capable of distinguishing the relevant goods or services. In my view, when the "TW" logo was placed in close association with the words "TENNIS WAREHOUSE" in 2003, this had the effect of substantially diluting any trade mark significance that attached to the words "TENNIS WAREHOUSE" by themselves. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] ATMO 47">Trade in alcoholic beverages in Australia has changed since then. In E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 ; (2008) 77 IPR 69 , Flick J considered whether beer and wine are goods of the same description. At page 85 he found on the evidence that: 
 [P]roducers of alcoholic beverages are no longer confined to the production of beer, as opposed to wine, or even as opposed to other alcoholic beverages such as rum or whisky. The large producers now produce a range of products and market themselves as doing so. Corporations which were once brewers now seek to develop their business through the acquisition of wineries, and joint ventures are developed as between producers of rum and spirits and the brewers. Companies which were once brewers now market and distribute a range of products including beer, wine, spirits, ciders and non-alcoholic drinks. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2010] HCA 15">The primary judge found that the combination of the words "Barefoot" and "Radler" in the trade mark BAREFOOT RADLER had its creative origin as follows. Radler is the German word for cyclist, and the term is traditionally used to describe a drink of beer mixed with lemonade developed in Germany in 1922, to meet the demand of groups of cyclists who "wanted a more refreshing drink so they could continue on their journey without falling off their bicycles! " [3] The primary judge found that it had occurred to Lion Nathan's Consumer Insight Manager to use the word "Barefoot" in connection with "Radler" after he saw a horse-racing "Form Guide" in which one of the racehorses was named "Barefootonbondi". 
  This matter concerns an application to remove, from the Register of Trade Marks ("the Register"), a trade mark in respect of which the appellant, E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery ("Gallo"), is the registered owner. In the Federal Court of Australia, Gallo claimed that the respondent, Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited ("Lion Nathan"), had infringed Gallo's Australian trade mark registration no 787765 for the trade mark "BAREFOOT", registered since 9 March 1999 under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) ("the Trade Marks Act ") in class 33 in respect of "Wines being goods in class 33" ("the registered trade mark"). Gallo was unsuccessful in this infringement claim before the primary judge (Flick J) [1] but successful on appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia (Moore, Edmonds and Gilmour JJ) ("the Full Court") [2] . By an amended cross-claim in the proceedings at first instance, Lion Nathan sought an order that Gallo's registered trade mark be removed from the Register on the grounds of non-use during the three year period from 7 May 2004 to 8 May 2007 ("the statutory period"). It is not disputed that this is the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2010] FMCA 121">Determination of whether a trade mark is "deceptively similar" does not involve a side-by-side comparison, but a determination as to "whether there is a likelihood of deception or confusion from a recollection or impression of the registered trade mark". [90] What is to be compared is the impression a person would have based on a recollection of the registered trade mark normally used and the impugned trade mark as it appears in the use complained of, the impression being that of the person of ordinary intelligence and memory. Some attempt to estimate the impression produced on the minds of such persons must be made, but it is the impression carried away and retained that is necessarily the basis of any mistaken belief that the challenge to the trade mark is the same, allowing for the fact that the impression (based on recollection) may be imperfect. Ultimately whether a trade mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion is, a matter of impression and common sense. [91] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2010] ATMO 17">Commercially speaking, it is not shown that the use made by the Plaintiffs of this mark was not an ordinary and genuine use, and it certainly was substantial. If that is so, then it seems to me that the use is not disqualified... 
 
Gummow J considered the meaning of the expression "use in good faith" as a criterion for infringement in Johnson &amp; Johnson Australia Pty Ltd v Stirling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 310 ; (1991) 30 FCR 326 at 354, pointing out that:
 
There is, in relation to the comparable provisions in the British Act of 1938, authority to the effect that in order to qualify as such use there must be a real or genuine use in a commercial sense, rather than colourable activity and "token" use designed to lead trade rivals to think that the registered proprietor was using its mark in a way which gave it the protection of the legislation. See also E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 ; [2008] 77 IPR 69 at [99] - [707] and the authorities there referred to. We were directed to several other authorities which took a broader view of the expression but insofar as they conflict with the above authorities we do not consider they were correct. In the present case having regard to the above authorities, we do not consider that her Honour erred when she observed at [8] of her reasons that s 92(4) of the Act requires no more than a genuine intent to use the mark for commercial purposes, and that the reference to bona fide intention to use is not sufficiently wide to encompass the circumstances of the present case. Mr Bebber also mentioned in his submissions that the case had been appealed to the Federal Court. However, he put it to me that, despite her decision to recommend to the removal applicant that what it really needed to make was an application for cancellation of the trade mark (with which it ultimately succeeded), Gordon J did not overturn the findings of the delegate, because she did not determine the issue of whether 'good faith' in section 92(4) involves enquiries as to honesty or subjective intentions. He attributed this interpretation to her comments that: 
Having considered the evidence led, and submissions made, I was poised to answer that question in the affirmative and uphold the appeal, on the basis that "good faith" for the purposes of s 92(4) requires no more than genuine intent to use a mark for commercial purposes; it does not involve any element of honesty or subjective good intentions: see generally E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd (2008) 77 IPR 69 ; [2008] FCA 934 at [187] ---[192] (Gallo) (examining the meaning of "good faith" under related provisions of the TMA).

<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FCA 1437">In the absence of any statutory definition of the phrase " substantially identical ", the meaning of that phrase is to be determined by its ordinary or usual meaning, namely that which is " in substance " the same or " essentially " the same: Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCA 1020 at [70] [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; , 93 FCR 365 at 387 per Branson J. Whether marks are " substantially identical " requires a side by side comparison and depends on the Court's own judgment: Shell Company of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd [1963] HCA 66 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407 at 414. Windeyer J there observed (some citations omitted): 
 
 In considering whether marks are substantially identical they should, I think, be compared side by side, their similarities and differences noted and the importance of these assessed having regard to the essential features of the registered mark and the total impression of resemblance or dissimilarity that emerges from the comparison. "The identification of an essential feature depends", it has been said, "partly on the Court's own judgment and partly on the burden of the evidence that is placed before it": de Cordova v Vick Chemical Co [(1951) 68 R.P.C. 103 , at p. 106]. Whether there is substantial identity is a question of fact ... 
 

 
In order to determine whether marks are " substantially identical ", they should thus be compared side by side with their similarities and differences noted: Coca-Cola Co [1999] FCA 1721 at [38] , 96 FCR at 121 per Black CJ, Sundberg and Finkelstein JJ. See also: E &amp; J Gallo Winery [2008] FCA 934 at [41] to [43], 77 IPR at 78.  A " trade mark " is defined by s 17 of the Trade Marks Act as being: 
 
 ... a sign used, or intended to be used, to distinguish goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other person. 
 

 
Registration of a trade mark confers " exclusive rights ". Section 20(1) provides as follows:
 
 
 If a trade mark is registered, the registered owner of the trade mark has, subject to this Part, the exclusive rights: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) to use the trade mark; and 
 (b) to authorise other persons to use the trade mark; 
 
 
 
 
 in relation to the goods and/or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. 
 

 
The function of a trade mark is " to give an indication to the purchaser or possible purchaser as to the manufacture or quality of the goods --- to give an indication to his eye of the trade source from which the goods come, or the trade hands through which they pass on their way to the market ": In re Powell's Trade-Mark [1893] 2 Ch 388 at 403 to 404 per Bowen LJ. Use " as a trade mark " in s 120(1) is use of the mark as a " badge of origin " in the sense that it indicates a connection in the course of trade between goods and the person who applies the mark to the goods: Coca-Cola Co v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 at [19] , [1999] FCA 1721 ; 96 FCR 107 at 115 per Black CJ, Sundberg and Finkelstein JJ; Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 605 at [45] , [2008] FCA 605 ; 76 IPR 161 at 171 per Sundberg J; E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 at [19] , [2008] FCA 934 ; [2008] FCA 934 ; 77 IPR 69 at 73 to 74. Noted: Andreazza A, "Barefoot Gets the Boot: Trade Mark Infringement and Removal for Non-Use" (2008) 21(5) IPLB 85. For subsequent proceedings, see E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 27 , 175 FCR 386 ; E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2009] HCATrans 180.  By way of contrast, whether a mark is " deceptively similar " is not to be determined by a side by side comparison, but rather by reference to whether there is a likelihood of deception or confusion from a recollection or impression of the registered mark: Anheuser-Busch Inc v Budejovicky Budvar [2002] FCA 390 at [143] [2002] FCA 390 ; , 56 IPR 182 at 216. Allsop J there observed (citations omitted): 
 
 [143] The question of deceptive similarity must be judged by a comparison different from the side by side comparison undertaken to assess substantial identity; the question being the likelihood of deception or confusion from a recollection or impression of the registered mark. Thus, a side by side comparison is inadequate, and too narrow a test. The comparison is between, on the one hand, the impression based on recollection of the registered mark used in a normal or fair manner that persons of ordinary intelligence and memory would have, and, on the other hand, the impressions that such persons would get from the impugned mark as it appears in the use complained of ...

It is not appropriate when making this comparison to undertake a wider enquiry of the kind undertaken in a passing off action or in a proceeding in which a contravention of Part V of the Trade Practices Act is alleged: CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 at [44] , [2000] FCA 1539 ; 52 IPR 42 at 62 per Ryan, Branson and Lehane JJ.

 This matter is set against a background of ongoing litigation between the parties over use of the trade mark the subject of application number 1168037 [1] , first in the Federal Court of Australia [2] and now pending before the High Court of Australia. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] ATMO 41"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] ATMO 38">To make an end of this matter, I am not so satisfied under any of those headings. As to the proper approach to the exercise of the discretion, I accept that decisions such as Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd v Beltrami SpA (1998) 46 IPR 411 , to which Mr Fitzpatrick referred, have been overtaken by more authoritative precedent, see Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; (2005) 66 IPR 131. Consistently, in E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 ; (2008) 77 IPR 69 at 110, Flick J said: 
And it is a discretion, it is considered, no longer constrained by any requirement to establish "exceptional circumstances"; it is a discretion which may be exercised "when it is reasonable to do so": Kowa , supra. Lander J there indicated that he was of the view that it was not reasonable not to remove the mark in issue. Of the discretion, his Honour concluded (at [97]---[98]):
 
[97] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] ATMO 31">Early decisions considering exercise of the discretion under s.101 suggested an opponent would need to show special facts or circumstances, or an overriding question of public interest, to warrant leaving a mark on the Register in the absence of relevant use [4] . In the recent decision in Pioneer Computers Australia Pty Ltd v Pioneer KK [2009] FCA 135 (23 February 2009), however, Bennett, J said: The discretion under s.101(3) is a broad discretion to decide not to remove a trade mark from the Register or not to carve out some of the goods and services for which the mark is registered, even if s.92 grounds have been made out, if the Court is satisfied that it is reasonable to do so. Irrespective of the lack of use of the trade marks on the removal goods and the removal services in the relevant period, there is a discretion not to alter the registrations. In Kowa Company [5] at [98], Lander J rejected the submission that a party seeking the exercise of the discretion needs to show "exceptional circumstances". In E &amp; J Gallo [6] at [198], Flick J agreed with Lander J that there is no requirement to establish exceptional circumstances. With respect, I also agree with Lander J that there is no warrant to read a requirement for exceptional circumstances into s.101(3). In E &amp; J Gallo at [202]-[203], Flick J stated that the following factors set out by Falconer J in Hermes Trade Mark [1982] RPC 425 were of assistance in considering the exercise of the discretion: there had been no abandonment of the trade mark; the registered proprietors of the mark still had a residual reputation in the mark; there had been sales by the registered proprietors of goods for which removal was sought since the relevant period ended; the applicants for removal had entered the market without having taken steps to ascertain from the Register whether anyone had a right to exclude their use of the mark; the registered proprietors were not aware of the applicant's sales under the mark. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2009] FCAFC 27">The primary judge published reasons on 20 June 2008 ( E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 934) which first addressed the question of infringement and secondly addressed the use of the registered mark by the registered owner in the context of determining whether the mark should be removed from the Register. Further reasons were published on 27 June 2008 ( E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 1005) which concerned the day on which the removal from the Register should take effect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2009] ATMO 18">To the contrary, the negotiations with Gaffney indicate a failure to proceed, they can be interpreted as indicating a lack of interest or commitment on the part of the Removal Opponent, and they demonstrate that, far from substantiating an intention on the part of the Removal Opponent to enter the Australian market for clothing, the Removal Opponent remains indecisive in relation to this country. In reaching my finding in this regard, I draw support from the decision of Justice Flick in E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery v. Lion Nathan Australia Pty. Limited [2008] FCA 934 who found in the context of that case that the negotiations which had there taken place "had not proceeded beyond just that, negotiations. " [3] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2009] FCA 135">Pioneer Australia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pioneer KK. The use of the marks indicates a connection in the course of trade with the registered proprietor of the marks, Pioneer KK. It cannot be said that the use of the marks by Pioneer Australia is somehow deceptive by indicating a different origin of the goods (see also E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 008 596 370) [2008] FCA 934 ; (2008) 77 IPR 69 at [102] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2009] FCAFC 7">Gummow J considered the meaning of the expression "use in good faith" as a criterion for infringement in Johnson &amp; Johnson Australia Pty Ltd v Stirling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 310 ; (1991) 30 FCR 326 at 354, pointing out that: 
There is, in relation to the comparable provisions in the British Act of 1938, authority to the effect that in order to qualify as such use there must be a real or genuine use in a commercial sense, rather than colourable activity and "token" use designed to lead trade rivals to think that the registered proprietor was using its mark in a way which gave it the protection of the legislation. See also E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 ; [2008] 77 IPR 69 at [99] - [707] and the authorities there referred to. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2009] ATMO 9">The comparison is between mark and mark : Pfizer Products Inc. v Karam , 2006] FCA 1663. The Mark is identical (not just "substantially identical") with the Registered Mark. The authorities regarding "substantial identity" have recently been summarised by Justice Flick in E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 ; (2008) 77 IPR 69 , [41 --- 43].The two main points are that where the marks are "substantially identical" is to be determined by the ordinary or usual meaning of such a phrase, namely that which is in substance the same or essentially the same and whether the marks are "substantially identical" requires a side-by-side comparison and depends on the Court's own judgment ( Shell v Esso [1963] HCA 66 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407 , 414 per Windeyer J). Justice Flick also discussed the meaning of the phrase "deceptively similar" in Gallo at [52 --- 58]. Section 14 of the Act defines goods and services as being "similar" to other goods and services if "they are the same" or "they are of the same description".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] ATMO 94">That case was appealed to the Federal Court where Gordon J. noted in the preface to her decision that "the issues have not been framed in a way that accurately identifies the dispute between the parties". In that case, her honour said: 
The "appeal" came on for hearing on 3 May and again on 12 September 2007. The principal question presented in those hearings was whether evidence of a bona fide intention to use a mark for trading purposes is sufficient to demonstrate good faith even where the applicant for registration gained knowledge of the mark as an employee of the owner of the unregistered mark and in circumstances tending to suggest a breach of fiduciary duties or even (malicious) intent to block a competitor. Having considered the evidence led, and submissions made, I was poised to answer that question in the affirmative and uphold the appeal, on the basis that "good faith" for the purposes of s 92(4) requires no more than genuine intent to use a mark for commercial purposes; it does not involve any element of honesty or subjective good intentions: see generally E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 at [187] - [192] (examining the meaning of "good faith" under related provisions of the TMA). However, during the course of the hearings it became apparent that what LE 2003 really wanted, and should have applied for in the first place, was the expungement of the registrations by Edwards under s 88 of the TMA on the basis that Edwards was not the owner of the unregistered marks: ss 52 and 58 of the TMA. I therefore delayed giving judgment in VID 934 of 2006 so that a separate application could be brought on that basis and the matters resolved together. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] ATMO 62">What constitutes goods of the same description was the subject of recent consideration by Flick J in E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 934 at paragraph 67: 
It is again accepted that it is a question of fact and impression whether goods are "of the same description": Rowntree plc v Rollbits Pty Ltd (1988) 10 IPR 539 at 545 per Needham J. In resolving this question, the fact that goods serve different purposes is not conclusive; nor is any one particular consideration conclusive. Assistance, however, has been provided as to those matters which may be taken into account: Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2008] FCA 1005">1 In this matter reasons for decision were published on 20 June 2008 ( E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan [2008] FCA 934) and the matter was stood over to this morning for the purpose of making final orders disposing of the proceeding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2008] FCA 970">8 Having considered the evidence led, and submissions made, I was poised to answer that question in the affirmative and uphold the appeal, on the basis that "good faith" for the purposes of s 92(4) requires no more than genuine intent to use a mark for commercial purposes; it does not involve any element of honesty or subjective good intentions: see generally E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 at [187] - [192] (examining the meaning of "good faith" under related provisions of the TMA).
