<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 671">Two other important considerations were referred to by Jessup J in Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd [2006] FCA 1388 ; (2006) 236 ALR 322 at [50] (" Darwalla "). First, it is not the Court's function to second guess the applicant's advisers as to the question of whether an applicant (and group members) ought to accept an offer of settlement; the Court should not consider it knows more about the risks of the litigation than the Group Members' advisers. Second, there will rarely be one unique outcome which should be regarded as the only fair and reasonable one; so long as the settlement falls within the range of fair and reasonable outcomes, taking everything into account, it will qualify for approval. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] VSC 215">[10] 
 
 
 60 Goldberg J referred to a number of matters that the Court will take into account in determining what is fair and reasonable. The matters referred to by his Honour were the amount offered to each group member, the prospects of success in the proceeding, the likelihood of the group members obtaining judgment for an amount significantly in excess of the settlement offer, the terms of any advice received from counsel and from any independent expert in relation to the issues which arise in the proceeding, the likely duration and cost of the proceeding if continued to judgment, and the attitude of group members to the settlement. [11] 
61 Jessup J, in Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, [12] observed that his review of subsequent judgments of the Court under s 33V did not disclose any pattern of systematic consideration of these matters in the way, for example, of a checklist, [13] and that the case before him involved specific problems and issues which no predetermined list could ever hope to anticipate. He also commented that those factors threw little light on the proper resolution of the rather difficult inter se issues that arose in the proceeding before him. [14] 
62 It is true that in practice every case must be dealt with on its own merits, and by reference to specific factors which might raise serious doubts as to fairness and the like. Neither should the court consider that it knows more about the group members' businesses than the applicants, or more about the actual risks of the litigation than their advisers. So long as the agreed settlement falls within the range of fair and reasonable outcomes, taking everything into account, it should be regarded as qualifying for approval under s 33V. [19] 
 
 
 111 In my view, the settlement falls within the range of fair and reasonable outcomes. 112 A number of the objectors expressed dissatisfaction with Casey and what was perceived to be its failure to take responsibility for what had happened and to deal with the problems identified in an open and transparent way. The objections revealed, it must be said, feelings of mistrust towards Casey which have clearly (and understandably) affected the attitude of some group members to the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 541">The relevant principles may be summarised as follows: The Court must be satisfied that any settlement has been undertaken in the interests of group members as a whole, and not just in the interests of the applicant and the respondent: ACCC v Chats House Investments (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258; The task of the Court is an onerous one especially where the application is not opposed: Lopez v Star World Enterprises [1999] FCA 104 at [16] ; The practical judicial approach is to identify any features of a settlement that are obviously unreasonable or unfair. Where some group members object to a settlement and state their reasons, those reasons will provide a convenient focus by reference to which the Court will decide matters of reasonableness and fairness: Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd (ACN 009 698 631) v F Hoffman-La Roche (No 2) [2006] FCA 1388 ; (2006) 236 ALR 322 at [39] ; It is not the Court's function to second-guess the applicants' advisers as to the answer to the question whether the applicants ought to have accepted the respondent's offer; the Court's function is, relevantly, confined to the question whether the settlement was fair and reasonable. There will rarely, if ever, be a case in which there is a unique outcome which should be regarded as the only fair and reasonable one: Darwalla at [50]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FCA 277">And, in determining what is " fair and reasonable " it is to be recognised that there may well be few cases where there is only one outcome which can be so described: Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd [2006] FCA 1388, 236 ALR 322. Jessup J there thus observed: 
 
 [50] It is not, I consider, the court's function under s 33V of the Federal Court Act to second-guess the applicants' advisers as to the answer to the question whether the applicants ought to have accepted the respondents' offer; the court's function is, relevantly, confined to the question whether the settlement was fair and reasonable. There will rarely, if ever, be a case in which there is a unique outcome which should be regarded as the only fair and reasonable one. In settlement negotiations, some parties, and some advisers, tend to be more risk-averse than others. There is nothing unreasonable involved in either such position and, under s 33V, the court should, up to a point at least, take the applicants and their advisers as it finds them. Neither should the court consider that it knows more about the group members' businesses than the applicants, or more about the actual risks of the litigation than their advisers. So long as the agreed settlement falls within the range of fair and reasonable outcomes, taking everything into account, it should be regarded as qualifying for approval under s 33V.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1029">Third, the settlement proposes a payment to the applicants as compensation for their time and expenses incurred in prosecuting the proceedings on behalf of group members. The submission is that each of the applicants spent considerable time providing instructions and monitoring the progress of the action on behalf of all group members and should be reimbursed accordingly. I am satisfied that the proposed reimbursement is reasonable. A similar provision was upheld in Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman-La Roche (No 2) [2006] FCA 1388 ; (2006) 236 ALR 322 , [76]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] VSC 357">[17] 
 
 64 In this proceeding, all of the parties are asking the Court to approve the Compromise.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 1235">I also considered the principles identified by Jacobson J in Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 2008 at [56] to [66]; the observations of Goldberg J in Williams v FAI Homes Security Pty Ltd (No. 4) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2001) 180 ALR 459 ; Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffmann-Laroche Ltd (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1388 ; (2007) 236 ALR 322 per Jessup J; and Vernon v Village Life Ltd [2009] FCA 516. The nine factor test described by Goldberg J in Williams v FAI Homes Security Pty Ltd (No. 4) as "helpful in the Australian jurisdiction" derives from a nine factor test adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the third circuit in Re General Motors Corp Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Products Liability Litigation [1995] USCA3 325 ; 55 F 3d 768 at 785.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 1189">The approach to be taken by the Court was recently reviewed by Jessup J in Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1388 ; (2006) 236 ALR 322. Jessup J pointed out that there is little specificity that can be attached to the words "fair" or "reasonable". His Honour expressed the opinion that the practical judicial approach appears to be to identify any features of a settlement that are obviously unreasonable or unfair ( Darwalla at [39]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 572">I turn now to consider whether settlement of the proceeding ought to be approved under s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act . The relevant principles are now well settled: see, for example, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258 per Branson J; Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4 ) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2000) 180 ALR 459 at 465-6 [19] per Goldberg J; Neil v P &amp; O Cruises Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1325 at [6] - [7] per Weinberg J; Jarrama Pty Ltd v Caltex Australia Petroleum Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1114 at [10] per Crennan J; Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (No 5) [2004] FCA 1406 ; (2004) 212 ALR 311 at 317-8 [37] - [42] per Sackville J; Crawford v Bank of Western Australia Ltd [2005] FCA 949 at [16] - [21] per Lee J; Georgiou v Old England Hotel Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 705 at [18] per Young J; Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1388 ; (2006) 236 ALR 322 at 332 [30] and [31] per Jessup J; and Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 897 at [17] --- [20] per Gordon J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCA 516">It seems that the authorities to which I referred in Taylor v Telstra suggest that there might be some slight difference of emphasis between the approach taken by Goldberg J in Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2001) 180 ALR 459 and Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffmann-La Roche Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 1388 ; (2007) 236 ALR 322. However, both of these approaches indicate that the essential question is whether the settlement is fair and reasonable having regard to the claims made by group members who will be bound by the settlement. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FCA 19">
 
His Honour referred to a nine-factor test which has been adopted in the United States in considering whether to approve settlements as fair and reasonable. In Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1388 ; (2007) 236 ALR 322 , Jessup J took a slightly different approach from Goldberg J. His Honour observed at [3] that each case is dealt with on its own merits and by reference to specific factors which might raise serious doubts as to fairness. His Honour said at [35] that he could see no particular warrant for incorporating into Part IVA of the Act the requirements of the rules of the court of an overseas jurisdiction.</sentence>
