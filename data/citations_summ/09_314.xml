<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 495">Counsel for CNP relied upon the following passage in my judgment in Praetorin Pty Ltd v TZ Ltd [2009] NSWSC 1237 ; (2009) 76 ACSR 236: 
 
"36. It is therefore for the present plaintiffs, being members of TZL, to satisfy the court that they are "acting in good faith" and that the inspection they seek is to be made "for a proper purpose". The content of that composite requirement was recently explained by Goldberg J in Re Style Ltd; Merim Pty Ltd v Style Ltd [2009] FCA 314 ; (2009) 255 ALR 63: 
 
'Merim must do more than demonstrate that it is dissatisfied with the management decisions: Re Augold NL [1987] 2 Qd R 297 at 308; (1986) 11 ACLR 362 at 370; Cescastle Pty Ltd v Renak Holdings Ltd (1991) 6 ACSR 115 at 117. Merim must satisfy me that it is entitled to inspect the books because the information sought relates to matters that it as a shareholder ought to be informed of by the company: see, for example, Czerwinski v Syrena Royal Pty Ltd (No 1) (2000) 34 ACSR 245 ; [2000] VSC 12 5 at [12]. ' 
 
37.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1273">The respondents recognise that the Court may make an order authorising the applicant to inspect "books of the company" but says that the Court in considering such an application, should not only consider whether it is appropriate to do so by reference to the stated criteria, but also to consider which of the books of a company should be made available for that purpose: Majestic Resources NL v Caveat Pty Ltd [2004] WASCA 201 at [20] ---[21]. This proposition again makes sense. The proper purpose for the inspection will usually assist in identifying the books that bear upon that purpose: see Re Style Ltd [2009] FCA 314 ; (2009) 255 ALR 63 , at [71]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] WASC 51">63 There are a number of recent decisions in cases where plaintiffs have attempted to get access to the insurance policies of companies and their directors targeted for litigation. In Re Style Ltd Merim Pty Ltd v Style Ltd [2009] FCA 314 Merim was a shareholder in Style which is an ASX listed company. Merim sought to inspect Style's books to investigate whether Style's directors and officers had breached their duties and whether they had misled Style's members and the market regarding the performance of Style and the application of funds, particularly the proceeds of a convertible note issue made in July 2007. Merim sought an order to permit its representatives to inspect D&amp;O insurance policies held by Style. Goldberg J noted that the parties had not identified any previous cases considering whether orders should be made which allowed for inspection under s 247A of the Act of such insurance policies, although Merim acknowledged that access to D &amp; O insurance policies usually would be denied under an application for preliminary discovery. Goldberg J concluded that information relating to the extent of cover granted under Style's D &amp; O insurance policies would be relevant to Merim's decision whether to apply for leave to bring proceedings in Style's name against any directors or officers of Style and granted access to them.</sentence>
