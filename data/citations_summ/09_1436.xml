<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 568">Reference in previous decisions has been made to the difficulties confronting this Court in cases involving unrepresented litigants, especially in migration cases. Grounds of appeal are frequently expressed in terms which do not comply with the Rules and which do not properly or adequately explain the basis upon which an appeal is to be advanced: SZNPI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 106. Grounds of appeal which simply, for example, recount unhelpfully that there has been " jurisdictional error " ( SZNSC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1436 at [25] ), or which simply say that "the learned primary judge erred in fact and law" ( SQMB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 165 at [10] ), or which state that the "Honorable Judge failed to follow necessary laws applicable to me" ( NAXD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 243 at [3] ), do not comply with O 52 r 13(2). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1542">Although leave may be granted to rely upon an argument raised for the first time on appeal, leave should not too readily be granted --- especially where it is not evident that the grant of leave is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice: SZNSC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1436. </sentence>
