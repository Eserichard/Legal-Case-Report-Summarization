<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] WASC 403">184 Dowsett J considered these authorities in Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Toea Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1443 ; (2006) 156 FCR 158 [148] - [170], in determining whether a landlord and manager of a market was liable, as a joint tortfeasor, for trade mark infringements committed by stallholders at the market. Having regard to the authorities, his Honour applied the principle that in order to hold the landlord and manager liable for the stallholders' infringements 'there must be a concurrence in the act or acts causing damage, not merely a coincidence of separate acts which by their conjoined effect cause damage', and that in order to satisfy that test in the present case, it is necessary to show that the respondents acted in concert with each stallholder in 'committing the tort' [171]. His Honour held that the landlord and manager had not 
 
 acted in common with any of the stallholders in the actions which constituted infringement of the applicant's copyrights. I am also satisfied that such infringements were not committed in the execution of any common purpose shared with the respondents. As I have said, the respondents' purpose was to conduct an efficient and profitable Market. The purpose of each stallholder was the successful conduct of his or her stall. There was no common purpose [172]. </sentence>

Gummow J made like observations at 600. Applied: Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Toea Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1443 at [164] , [2006] FCA 1443 ; 156 FCR 158 at 196. See also: Baxter v Obacelo Pty Limited [2001] HCA 66 at [18] , [2001] HCA 66 ; 205 CLR 635 at 646 to 647 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] VSC 318">21 Consistent with these principles, McPherson J in Adsteam Building Industries Pty Ltd v Queensland Cement and Lime Company Ltd (No 4) said [12] : 
 
 "Much the same conclusion is true of the allegation of 'acting in concert' in the same paragraph of the pleading and particulars. As at present advised I cannot see that it is possible for persons to 'act in concert' towards an end or object, or even simply to act in concert, unless there is at least an understanding between them as to their common purpose or object. The expression in question evokes the notion of joint actors, or perhaps even joint tortfeasors, as to which it is settled that there must be 'concerted action to a common end': see The Koursk [1924] p 140, 156. A mere coincidence of separate acts is insufficient: see Fleming, The Law of Torts , 6 th ed, at pp 227-228". (Emphasis added. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1493">21 In the present case, there is a single course of infringement (the creation of the Vawdrey Engineering Drawings and the resulting manufacture of trailers) of a single copyright (the Krueger Drawings). Both Camerons and Vawdrey joined in that infringement in that Vawdrey could not have completed its drawings and manufacture without receiving instructions, based on the Krueger Drawings, from Camerons, and Camerons could not have completed the infringement without the execution by Vawdrey of those instructions. Each participated in committing the wrong of which Krueger now complains and thus the liability of each for the damage sustained by Krueger as a consequence of commission of that wrong is to be determined as if each was a joint tortfeasor with the other: The Koursk [1924] P 140 , cited with approval in Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Toea Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1443 ; (2006) 156 FCR 158 at [149] ; see also Balkin and Davis, Law of Torts (3rd 2004) at [29.24]-[29.41].</sentence>
