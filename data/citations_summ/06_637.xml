They may wish to reconsider their position, as may the Applicants, in light of the conclusions reached as to the limits of the right of inspection permitted by the Federal Court Rules . It may be noted that in Lifetime Investments Pty Ltd v Commercial (Worldwide) Financial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 637 an order was made for the return of documents to the solicitor of a party apparently " to facilitate completion of discovery " . </sentence>
