On 7 June 2007 an ex parte interim injunction was granted against ONGC restraining it from taking further steps to demand or obtain payment or renewing such claims or demands, from the banks under the performance guarantees: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 881. Orders were also made on 7 June 2007 for leave to serve ONGC out of the jurisdiction. The injunction against the banks was extended on 12 June 2007 and on 19 June 2007, following an inter partes hearing, when an application by the banks to discharge the injunction was dismissed: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 927. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 2082">Clough's claims against the Banks concern their intention to pay under the performance guarantees where such payment would constitute the Bank's being, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in ONGC's contraventions of the TPA. Injunctive relief is available against the Banks under s 80 of the TPA: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCA 927 at [11] - [14]. Injunctive and other relief would also be available under s 87(1A) of the TPA.  In the reasons for judgment in Clough Engineering Limited v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [No 2] [2007] FCA 927 at [46] - [66], I concluded that the balance of convenience strongly favoured the grant of injunctive relief. As I have said, ONGC, although a party, had not then appeared. This, importantly, meant that there was no party to contradict the existence of serious issues to be tried, as contended for by Clough. I formed the view that to have discharged the injunctions could very well lead to irreparable harm to Clough, its shareholders, employees and third parties. I concluded that damages would not be an adequate remedy. [66]  Against that, in cross-examination, Mr Simons conceded that Clough's capital expansion program will be secured by the Murray and Roberts funding and the recapitalisation and that there will be no need to retrench staff. This is a very different position to that which existed at the time that I refused the application of the Banks to discharge the injunction: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [No 2] [2007] FCA 927 at [54] - [63]. There is no evidence to establish specific irreparable damage to Clough. Consequences of the kind that I have referred to are not uncommon in such matters and indeed are often the probable consequences. Certainly, Mr Simons accepted that such consequences, broadly, were in the anticipation of Clough when the performance guarantees were given. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1319">69 Shortly after his Honour made these orders, the banks applied to have them set aside. Gilmour J refused to set aside the orders: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (No 2) [2007] FCA 927. His Honour said (at [43]):
 
 "I remain satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried as to whether ONGC has acted unconscionably in contravention of s 51AA of the Act in calling on or threatening to call on the performance guarantees despite there being no legal right on its part to do so. As Austin J said in Boral Formwork v Action Makers (2003) ATPR 41-953 at [14] when referring relevantly to s 51AA of the Act: 'the principle of autonomy applicable to a standby letter of credit, cannot override the statute'. I am also satisfied that upon the same factual matrix, there is a serious issue to be tried whether ONGC is in breach if [sic] the negative stipulation conditioning the right to call up the performance guarantees.
