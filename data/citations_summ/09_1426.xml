<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 59">3 The appellant did not pay goods and services tax (GST) in relation to either sale because, in his opinion, they were input taxed as sales of residential premises. On 30 June 2006 the respondent (the Commissioner) issued notices of assessment of GST for each sale: $122,727 on Gledston Street and $10,081 on Gladstone Road. The appellant's notices of objection were disallowed, and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affirmed the Commissioner's objection decisions. The appellant's appeal to this Court was dismissed: Vidler v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1426 ; (2009) 74 ATR 520. The present appeal is from that decision.
