 21. In his written submissions, the applicant's solicitor referred to WAEJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 188 , SAAK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (2002) 121 FCR 185 , and MZXDH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 719. The first two of these cases contain statements in which a Full Court caution against making "an adverse finding on the credit of [a person] by reference to demeanour alone" . The judgments also suggest that a Tribunal should "identify how the demeanour of the applicant caused the tribunal to conclude" that evidence should be discarded. </sentence>
