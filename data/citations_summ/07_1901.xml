<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1290">The Minister submits that even if some factual finding made by the Tribunal contained some error of fact, this in itself does not constitute jurisdictional error (Abebe v The Commonwealth (1999) 197 CLR 510 ; [1999] HCA 14 at [137] , and see also SZJHR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1901 at [45] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1140">I am not persuaded that the Tribunal's consideration of Mr Laba-Sarkis' statement reveals any jurisdictional error. The Tribunal was not generally obliged to seek additional evidence from Mr Laba-Sarkis, nor make further inquiries of him in the absence of any exceptional circumstance (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 at [1] and [25]). I am unable to identify any error of discretion by the Tribunal in relation to its powers of inquiry, including its discretion to take evidence from proposed witnesses (see SZJHR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1901). In my opinion, it was open to the Tribunal to form the view that Mr Laba-Sarkis' written statement did not overcome the Tribunal's concerns with the applicant's own evidence. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 708">As was said in SZJHR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1901 at [45] : "An error of fact made by the Tribunal when exercising its jurisdiction is not a jurisdictional error. An error of that kind does not provide this Court with jurisdiction to quash the decision: Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [137] . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 608">As was said in SZJHR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1901 at [45] : "An error of fact made by the Tribunal when exercising its jurisdiction is not a jurisdictional error. An error of that kind does not provide this Court with jurisdiction to quash the decision: Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [137] . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 630">In relation to the Australian witness, the Tribunal had a discretion not to accede to a request that it take evidence from a witness (see s.426(3) and authorities including Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Katisat [2005] FCA 1908 and SZJHR v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1901). I am not persuaded that there was any error in its exercise of this discretion, giving rise to jurisdictional error affecting its substantive decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 407">The Tribunal's findings in relation to the applicant husband's conversion to Christianity in Australia was that it would disregard this conduct because of its finding that this conduct was "purely intended to further" the protection visa application. This finding was made in the exercise of the Tribunal's jurisdiction provided by the relevant statute. In light of this, even if the Tribunal wrongly assumed that Jehovah's Witnesses required their adherents to reject non-Jehovah's Witness spouses and family, this was not a jurisdictional error but an error made within the jurisdiction. As was said in SZJHR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FC A 1901 at [45] : "An error of fact made by the Tribunal when exercising its jurisdiction is not a jurisdictional error. An error of that kind does not provide this Court with jurisdiction to quash the decision: Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [137] . " </sentence>
