<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1211">As Finkelstein J said in ITW AFC Pty Ltd v Loi &amp; Tran Pty Ltd (2008) 76 IPR 129 ; [2008] FCA 552 at [31] : 
 
 To prove commercial success the patentee will call evidence of market share, growth of market share, or displacement of existing prior art devices. That patentee will also be required to show that this success was due to the merits of his invention and not to other factors, such as advertising or significant sales efforts.
