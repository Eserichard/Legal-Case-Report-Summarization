<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1273">However, in my view, it should not be thought that it easily follows that once an applicant for such interlocutory relief demonstrates that there is a serious question to be tried and that the balance of convenience favours seems not to be in issue. While it may be stated that the threshold for establishing the Court's power to issue an injunction is not particularly onerous (see Australian Building and Construction Commissioner v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 1092 ; (2007) 189 IR 165 at [39] ) there are other factors at play. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 71">Several previous decisions have addressed the question of whether or not the fact that unlawful conduct has ceased should in itself be sufficient to decline the grant of an injunction sought. It has been determined that the fact the unlawful industrial action has ceased is not of itself a reason not to grant an injunction. Examples of such decisions include Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2006) 154 IR 228 ; John Holland Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2005] WASC 146 ; (2005) 144 IR 418 ; United Group Infrastructure ; CBI Construction Pty Ltd v Abbott [2008] FCA 1629 ; (2008) 177 IR 134 ; and Australian Building and Construction Commissioner v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 1092. </sentence>
