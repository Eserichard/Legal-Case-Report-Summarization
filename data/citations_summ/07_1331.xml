<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1283">As to the TAB interests, I consider that as holders of a joint privilege in the documents in Exhibit E those parties should be given leave to be heard (see, for example, Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts; In the matter of an application by Opel Networks Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1331 at [8] ). Order 6 r 17 of the Federal Court Rules permits this course having regard to, amongst other things, "whether the intervener's contribution will be useful and different from the contribution of the parties to the proceeding" (Order 16 r (2)(a)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 996">I note, however, that in Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts; In the matter of an application by Opel Networks Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1331 (28 August 2007), handed down just seven weeks after Carnegie and which does not refer to Carnegie , the question whether an application under O 15A, r 3 was a proceeding arose again and was answered differently. Graham J at [15] stated: 
 
 An application by a prospective applicant ('A') for an order for discovery to be made to that prospective applicant by a prospective respondent ('B'), to enable A to inspect, subject to an order of the Court permitting inspection under Order 15A rule 10 and Order 15 rule 11, documents that B has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had in B's possession, with a view to assisting A in making a decision as to whether to commence a proceeding in the Court against B, is not itself a 'proceeding' within the meaning of Order 6 rule 8(1)(b) or Order 6 rule 17, notwithstanding the 'unless the contrary intention' definition of 'proceeding' in s 4 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 2065">37 I am not satisfied that information of such sensitivity to Tibra should be disclosed at this early stage. The authorities, taken together, stress that the confidentiality of the information sought in a preliminary discovery application is a relevant consideration in the discretion of the Court to grant the relief, but not an overriding consideration: Griffin Energy Pty Ltd v Western Power Corporation [2006] FCA 1241 at [110] ; Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information, Technology and the Arts [2007] FCA 1331 at [31] - [32]. The Court has tended to permit applicants to erect suitable regimes to ensure the confidentiality of any material acquired by way of preliminary discovery. In this case, however, despite Optiver's proposal of a confidentiality regime, the exercise of the general discretion to refuse preliminary discovery is supported by two other considerations.</sentence>
