<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 910">As the SoP notes, this definition is derived from the diagnostic criteria set out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ("DSM-IV"), "the accepted touchstone": Drew v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 537. Statement of Principles are not relevant to the question of diagnosis: per Benjamin . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 485">The only such matters in evidence were Mr Newton's sighting of the body of the crew member of the Noongah and his financial difficulties in the 1990s. The medical evidence does not support any causal relationship between Mr Newton's posttraumatic stress disorder and either of those matters. As a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder cannot be made in relation to service-related incidents, consideration need not be given to issues of causation relating to that condition [4] . 
55. The diagnosis of alcohol abuse, unlike that for posttraumatic stress disorder, does not depend upon the existence of a factor such as criterion A noted above.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 276">As criterion A is an essential threshold element of the diagnostic criteria, I am also reasonably satisfied that the factual basis for making a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder, in relation to that incident, is not present. It follows that consideration need not be given to issues of causation relating to posttraumatic stress disorder [4] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 664">Dr Carter considered that criterion A was not met by the evaporator incident. Dr Mulholland, in his report, considered that criterion A was met but qualified this in his oral evidence on learning that the evaporator incident had not occurred in the manner advised by Mr Glasby. This had Mr Glasby in the confines of a 24 inch pipe. He conceded that it was possible that the incident could lead to post traumatic stress disorder but that it was less likely than was the case with the scenario initially described by Mr Glasby. As noted above, diagnostic matters are determined on the balance of probabilities. In reliance on the evidence of Dr Carter who rejected the relationship and of Dr Mullholland who considered the relationship to be a possibility, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that criterion A is not met by the evaporator incident. As this is an essential threshold element of the diagnostic criteria, I am also satisfied to that standard that the factual basis for making a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder, in relation to that incident, is not present. It follows that consideration need not be given to issues of causation relating to post traumatic stress disorder [3] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] AATA 545">This definition is derived from the diagnostic criteria set out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ("DSM-IV"), "the accepted touchstone": Drew v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 537 . Each of the doctors referred to DSM-IV and Dr Dinnen, in particular, dealt at length with the diagnostic criteria. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] AATA 473">The issue that troubles me is whether the occasion of the rocket attack on the Phan Rang base, and Mr Dadge's reported response to it, answer the description given in the diagnostic criteria for post traumatic stress disorder. Despite the medical evidence, and despite the benefit of being able to raise my concerns directly with Dr Oelrichs, I am not satisfied that either the event or its response was of the requisite character. In adopting this approach I am not seeking to undertake the task of diagnosis; it would be impermissible of me to do so. Rather I am undertaking that part of the task of a decision-maker that Gray J described in Mines v Repatriation Commission [7] in these terms: 
"It is therefore clear that the question whether a veteran is suffering, or has suffered, a claimed injury or disease must be determined to the reasonable satisfaction of the decision-maker, that is, on the balance of probabilities. That question is not to be determined by asking whether there is a reasonable hypothesis that the veteran is suffering, or has suffered, the injury or disease and asking whether the material establishes that the facts supporting that hypothesis do not exist beyond reasonable doubt. If the question is posed as whether a veteran has suffered PTSD as a result of a traumatic event said to have occurred during the veteran's operational service, it must be answered by saying that the decision-maker must be reasonably satisfied that the traumatic event occurred before reaching the conclusion that the veteran suffered PTSD. Only if such a conclusion is reached does the reasonable hypothesis process of reasoning, outlined in the four steps referred to in Deledio , come into operation. "
