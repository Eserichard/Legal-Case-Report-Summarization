<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1303">The parties cooperated and provided the Court with a statement of agreed facts and a joint outline of submissions. Those documents have satisfied me that it is appropriate to make the declarations sought as the evidence disclosed contraventions of the kind the subject of the declarations. As to the penalty, the Court retains the responsibility for imposing penalties and the making of orders: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v TEAC Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1859 ; (2007) ATPR 42-201. The Court is therefore not bound to make orders which the parties have agreed upon unless the Court is satisfied that those orders are appropriate. The Court however encourages the parties to arrive at negotiated settlements provided that the parties recognise that the ultimate responsibility for the terms and making of the orders lies with the Court: NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285.</sentence>

I need not repeat them. Additionally, a considerable body of authority has enlarged upon the principles governing the imposition of pecuniary penalties. Those principles were helpfully distilled by Kenny J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v TEAC Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1859 at [16] . Her Honour there said: 
 "The relevant principles governing the imposition of pecuniary penalties are discussed in Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 at [60] - [75]; Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,151-52, 154; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Consumer and Competition Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1997) 71 FCR 285 at 290-295; J McPhee &amp; Son (Aust) Pty Ltd v Australian Consumer and Competition Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532 ; and Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 at [51] - [58]. These authorities indicate that further relevant matters include: 

 
 (a) the size of the contravening company; 

 
 (b) the degree of power the company has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market; 

 
 (c) whether the conduct was systematic, deliberate, or covert; 

 
 (d) the period over which the conduct occurred; 

 
 (e) the effect on the functioning of the market and other economic effects of the conduct; 

 
 (f) whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level; 

 
 (g) whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and discipline, or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; and 

 
 (h) whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention.
