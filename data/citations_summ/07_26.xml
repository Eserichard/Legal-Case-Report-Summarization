<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 473">However, Mr Potts submits that the words of subsection (1)(c) prevent that occurrence taking place. The argument is that, because the Tribunal indicated that it had not in any way taken into account the similar application, s 424A(1)(a) was not enlivened. Strictly speaking, for the reasons explained by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at 615 [17] , s 424A(1)(a) speaks not to the time of the Tribunal's decision, but rather at some anterior point, at which the Tribunal turns its mind to the particulars which must be provided. For that reason, the strict answer to the question posed by 424A(1)(a) turns to be decided upon an examination of the Tribunal's state of mind at that anterior point. 16 The Minister submitted that the decision of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 228 CLR 294 meant that the anterior time is not a single point in time, but in effect is all times which existed up until the moment of the Tribunal's reasoning process.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 2">
 


113 There is some discussion of the relevant statutory provisions in the Federal Court decision of Wight v Honourable Chris Pearce, MP, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer [2007] FCA 26 at [10] to [22]. His Honour, Besanko J, noted at [13] that the drafting technique whereby s 21A is given an extended operation by s 4(6) is similar to that used in the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and was considered by the High Court in R v Australian Industrial Court; Ex parte CLM Holdings Pty Ltd [1977] HCA 6 ; (1977) 136 CLR 235. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 233">Nonetheless, I note the following (at [45]): "[45] The first respondent submits that even if there has been a breach of s 91R(3), the Court should refuse relief in its discretion. There is merit in the submission. I am satisfied that the findings in respect to the appellant's conduct in China would, independently of the findings as to his conduct in Australia, support the Tribunal's conclusions on the question of persecution: R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust) Ltd [1949] HCA 33; (1949) 78 CLR 389 at 400; Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54; (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 145-6; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte AALA [2000] FCA 57; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [104], [131] and [211]; SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [80] , [174] and [211]; see also SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [29] . [46] In those circumstances no purpose would be served by granting the relief sought. The appeal should be dismissed ..." In the current case, even if the Tribunal's error could be said to be jurisdictional error it is, in my view, not appropriate that the discretion be exercised, and I will not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 1540">It is necessary, of course, to have regard to the whole of the material in any given case in order to assess whether there is a new matter or a material mis-statement, exaggeration or distortion. Error in one document may need to be seen in the light of clarity and correctness in the balance of the material.
