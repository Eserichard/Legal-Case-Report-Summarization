<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1457">35 Similarly in Idameneo (No 123) Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Ltd [2007] FCA 1832 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 680 , at [114], Lindgren J stated:
 There is a well-known line of authority to the general effect that it is the province of directors, not the courts, to identify where the interests of a company lie, and that the courts do not exercise a supervisory function over the business judgments of directors: see, for example, Harlowe's Nominees Pty Ltd v Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil Co NL [1968] HCA 37 ; (1968) 121 CLR 483 at 493; Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821 at 832. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] NSWSC 893">31 On 27 November 2007 the Federal Court dismissed Primary's challenge to the efficacy of the break fee provisions: Idameneo (No 123) Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Ltd [2007] FCA 1832 ; (2007) 165 FCR 19. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 2078">9 I discussed break fees and other "deal protection" measures, notably "no shop" or exclusivity period provisions, in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 ( APN ) at [25]---[55] and to a lesser extent in Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1186 at [31] ---[35], and will not repeat what I said in those cases. Generally, a break fee is a fee payable by the target company to the acquiring company in certain circumstances in which the acquisition is not implemented. Such provisions form part of a merger implementation agreement to which the directors of the target company commit their company prior to a scheme of arrangement being considered by the target company's shareholders. When deciding whether to order that a meeting be convened or that a scheme be approved, the Court is not in a position to decide whether a merger implementation agreement was entered into in breach of the duties owed by the target company's directors. The Court could do so only on a contested hearing in which it is alleged, and sought to be proved, that by committing the target company to the merger implementation agreement, the directors breached their statutory and general law duties: see eg, Idameneo (No 123) Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Limited [2007] FCA 1832. </sentence>
