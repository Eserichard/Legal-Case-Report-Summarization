<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 63">29 The allegations being made are serious. And it may well be that the Court would be assisted by the factual and legal contentions sought to be advanced by the Applicants being presented by a legal practitioner. The resolution of the contentions being advanced will involve, if the proceedings were otherwise to proceed, some legal and factual complexity. Indeed, when previously addressing O 4, r 14, one consideration taken into account was the positive input which it was considered a legal practitioner could bring to the proceedings, including a disciplined consideration as to the allegation of fraud: Sharples v Australian Electoral Commission [2007] FCA 2102 at [10] --- [11].  6 The terms of O 4, r 14 have also been brought to the attention of the Second Applicant. Indeed, on 21 November 2007 Spender J made an order that:
 
 The Second Applicant is to prosecute the application only in accordance with Order 4 rule 14 of the Federal Court Rules . 

 On 11 December 2007 the Second Applicant contended that it then had available to it evidence which was not before Spender J and sought to have a Mr Robert Smith appear for the Second Applicant. On that occasion the need for compliance with O 4, r 14 was again affirmed and the indulgence sought by the Second Applicant to have Mr Smith appear for it was refused: Sharples v Australian Electoral Commission [2007] FCA 2102. Leave to appeal that decision was sought and refused: Sharples v Australian Electoral Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 2103. </sentence>
