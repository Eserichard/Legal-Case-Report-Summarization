("network"). the deed provided that in consideration for certain loans by network, the trustees would deliver to network all of the issued shares of wellington on the completion of the scheme. the amounts lent pursuant to the deed were calculated by reference to the value of tax losses confirmed by the deputy commissioner of taxation.  mr. king thereafter co-operated with the scheme trustees in a manner which was inconsistent with his own rights and interest as a shareholder in wellington but which was necessary for the operation of the scheme.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1380">Even if I were wrong in that conclusion, it is clear that I am not bound to act on admissions where I doubt their correctness: Damberg v Damberg [2001] NSWCA 87 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 492 at [160] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 794 ; (2007) 160 FCR 321 at [49] . In so far as each of Mr and Mrs Law may have admitted (contrary to my conclusion) direct use of the impugned signs as trade marks, I have every reason to doubt the correctness of, and decline to accept, any admissions so made, based on the evidence before me of the first respondent's trading activities and Mr and Mrs Law's involvement in it. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 863">In Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 794 ; (2007) 160 FCR 321 the ACCC alleged that a series of arrangements or understandings existed between competitors in the Geelong retail petrol market and had the purpose, or had or were likely to have the effect, of fixing those prices. The ACCC primarily sought the imposition of civil pecuniary penalties. Some respondents admitted the substance of the allegations against them. The ACCC sought to rely on formal admissions made by some respondents and on other admissions. After reviewing the authorities, Gray J concluded by reference to Heydon JA's formulation of the test in Damberg v Damberg : ... that the Court can (and perhaps should) decline to act on admissions when there is "reason to doubt their correctness", or "reason to question the correctness of the facts admitted or agreed". (at 338 [49]) 
His Honour concluded:
 
 It is clear that the powers in O 18, r 4(1) and (2) respectively [which deal with judgments on admissions] are discretionary; the Court is not obliged to give judgment on the basis of admissions made, whether in pleadings or otherwise. Nor is it obliged to give such judgment without determining the other issues remaining in the proceeding. (at 340 [55]) 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] WASC 206">115 Moreover, it is supported by RJB Nominees' admission in its defence that in October 2005 Mr Craig Parsons verbally informed Mr Baker that PMG accepted the Second Quotation. I accept, as PMG submits, that the court is not bound to act on admissions made by the parties and that the court can (and perhaps should) decline to act on an admission when there is reason to doubt its correctness or reason to question the correctness of the facts admitted or agreed: Damberg v Damberg [2001] NSWCA 87 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 492 [148] - [160]; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 794 ; (2007) 160 FCR 321 [42] - [49]. In this case, I do not consider that there is reason to doubt the correctness of PMG's admission or the fact agreed. The admission is consistent with the evidence of the only witness on the point. The admission is also supported by the objective probabilities, given the undisputed evidence that by the end of October 2005 Mr Craig Parsons was complaining that RJB Nominees had not commenced doing the work the subject of the Second Quotation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] HCA 19">An arrangement or understanding ordinarily involves an element of reciprocal commitment even though it may not be legally enforceable. It involves more than a mere hope or expectation that each party will act in accordance with its terms [32] . It is not necessary to consider the limits of the term here because there is no dispute that the respondents did have an arrangement or understanding with the two women. The question is whether it was the kind of arrangement or understanding with which sub-par (vi) is concerned.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] HCATrans 40">The cases, your Honours, are collected in the Leahy Petroleum Case , which is on our learned friend's list of authorities - your Honours need not go to it but it is [2007] FCA 794 ; 160 FCR 321 , particularly at paragraphs 35 to 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 52">There was evidence from Mr Goss that he telephoned Mark Lunedei of MC Labour to ask him why his people were there. Mr Lunedei did not give evidence at trial. Counsel for Mr Cahill argued that Mr Goss's evidence as to what Mr Lunedei said to him was admissible pursuant to s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act . I doubt that this was so: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 794 ; (2007) 160 FCR 321 at 339-340 [53] - [54] and Orica Investments Pty Ltd v William McCartney [2007] NSWSC 645 at [53] . Even if it were admissible, however, I would not accord the evidence any weight, having regard to the fact that I considered Mr Goss exaggerated his evidence from time to time to implicate the Union and Mr Mates. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] NSWSC 1441">87 The two authorities sent to me by Mr Scragg were Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Limited and Ors [2007] FCA 794 ; (2007) 160 FCR 321 ; and R v Hayter (2005) 1 WLR 605 ; (2005) UKHL 6. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1844">1 These reasons for judgment concern issues of costs. On 29 May 2007, I made orders dismissing the application in this proceeding, reserving questions of costs and giving directions about the filing of written submissions and the hearing of argument in relation to issues of costs. At that time, I also published reasons for judgment, very substantial in length, dealing with the principal issues in the proceeding. See Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 794. It is convenient to refer to that judgment in these reasons for judgment as Leahy Petroleum . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCAFC 147">97 The applicants relied on a decision of Gray J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 794 and argued that the relevance of the terms of an immunity or leniency agreement entered into by the ACCC and witnesses in a proceeding are important in evaluating the evidence of those witnesses. They argued that the documents are relevant to determine the particular conduct for which the Amcor representatives sought immunity. They argued that at trial, the credibility of the witnesses will be of crucial importance such that credibility might be decisive of the facts in issue. In doing so, they relied upon Palmer v The Queen [1998] HCA 2 ; (1998) 193 CLR 1 at 22 per McHugh J and Goldsmith v Sandilands [2002] HCA 31 ; (2002) 190 ALR 370 at [3] per Gleeson CJ and at [83] per Hayne J. 105 In my opinion, he was right to proceed upon the basis that he was bound. I am of the view that the decision of the Full Court was manifestly correct because issues as to credit are matters which are not raised upon the pleadings and do not oblige the parties to make discovery or produce documents. The decision in ACCC v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 794 is of no assistance to the applicants, as that case was not concerned with any question of discovery or production. Instead, his Honour's comments were directed to the evaluation of the respondent's evidence.</sentence>
