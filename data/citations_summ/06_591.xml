15 His Honour continued at [33] in these terms:
 
 
 "[33] The onus is on the plaintiffs to make it appear to the Court that, having made reasonable inquiries, they are unable to obtain sufficient information to decide whether or not to commence proceedings against Nylex. The third requirement of r 5.3(1)(a) requires an objective assessment of the information already possessed by the plaintiffs to determine whether that information is sufficient for such a decision to be made. The question is whether the applicant has insufficient information to be able to decide whether to institute proceedings; not merely to establish a cause of action. Hence, an applicant may be entitled to preliminary discovery of documents relevant to available defences, or the extent of apprehended breaches, or the likely quantum of damages, as well as of documents which may establish whether there is a cause of action. However, unless the applicant is lacking something reasonably necessary to make a decision whether to institute proceedings, he or she is not entitled to preliminary discovery. An applicant must disclose what information he or she already has relevant to making such a decision, and identify what information is lacking. Preliminary discovery cannot be used to build up a case which an applicant has already decided, or could decide, to bring ( Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Ltd (Lindgren J, Federal Court of Australia, 24 May 1996, unreported); St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 1360 ; (2004) 211 ALR 147 at 154 [26] ; Glencore International AG v Selwyn Mines Ltd (recs and mgrs apptd) [2005] FCA 801 ; [2005] FCA 801 ; (2005) 223 ALR 238 at 241 [15] ; Matrix Film Investment One Pty Ltd v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591 at [15] - [19], [25]). " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] WASCA 146">15 Sufficient information means no more than that which is reasonably necessary to enable the person to decide whether to commence or take proceedings. That is consistent with the construction of the Federal Court rule: Matrix Film Investment One Pty Ltd v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591 [16] - [18]. Ordinarily, what is reasonably necessary is unlikely to extend beyond documents constituting or contemporaneously recording the material facts or information necessary to determine the material facts. It should not extend, for example, to the potential parties' subjective evaluation of its potential liability. That would exclude the documents in par (b) of the order made by the primary judge. 61 Where, however, an applicant has already made the decision to bring proceedings against the respondent, O 26A r 4 has no application and no question of the adequacy of the information the applicant has available to it arises. As Tamberlin J pointed out in Matrix Film Investment One Pty Limited v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591 [19], the purpose of preliminary discovery is not to produce material which will strengthen or enhance a decision to commence proceedings but rather to provide what is reasonably necessary to enable the decision to be made. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 87">In Matrix Film Investment One Pty Ltd v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591 at [14] Tamberlin J referred to the principle that 'O 15A r 6 is to be beneficially construed and given the fullest scope that its language will reasonably allow, with the proper brake on any excesses lying in the discretion of the Court in the light of the specific circumstances' . However at [19] his Honour referred to the necessity for an applicant for preliminary discovery to show 'more than a mere assertion that there is a case against a prospective respondent' . His Honour continued: 
 The purpose of preliminary discovery is not to produce material which will strengthen or enhance a decision to commence proceedings but rather what is reasonably necessary to enable the decision to be made. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] WASC 147">Tamberlin J appears to have misstated this aspect of the reasons of Gyles J in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2065 when he suggested that O 15A r 6 was 'no longer appropriate' when an applicant had enough information to meet the threshold of a bare pleadable case. However, as his Honour said, the purpose of preliminary discovery is not to procure documents that would strengthen an applicant's decision to commence proceedings but rather to furnish it with information which is reasonably necessary to enable that decision to be made. In that connection he referred to his earlier decision in Matrix Film Investment One Pty Ltd v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591. It is not necessary to resolve such tensions as there are in the decided cases in order to accept that on existing authority an applicant for preliminary discovery may be entitled to discovery in order to determine what defences are available to a respondent and their possible strengths or to determine the extent of the respondent's breach and the likely quantum of any damages award: St Georges Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 1360 ; (2004) 211 ALR 147. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCAFC 133">21 His Honour however proceeded to find that the requirements of par (b) of O 15A r 6 were not satisfied. His Honour said (emphasis added):
 27 It is settled law that the purpose of preliminary discovery is not to procure documents that will strengthen an applicant's decision to commence proceedings, but rather to furnish it with information which is reasonably necessary to enable that decision to be made: see Matrix Film Investment One Pty Ltd v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591 at [19] . In other words, once a prospective applicant has enough information to meet the threshold of "a bare pleadable case" (C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864 at [44] ), an order under O 15A r 6 is no longer appropriate. Simply because it may be difficult to ascertain the finer detail of those pleadings and assess with accuracy the likelihood of success does not mean the prospects of success in the litigation should be amplified for the prospective applicant through the effects of an invasive order for preliminary discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] VSC 180">Preliminary discovery cannot be used to build up a case which an applicant has already decided, or could decide, to bring ( Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Ltd (Lindgren J, Federal Court of Australia, 24 May 1996; St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia LtdGlencore International AG v Selwyn Mines Ltd (recs and mgrs apptd) (2005) 223 ALR 238 at 241 [15]; Matrix Film Investment One Pty Ltd v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591 at [15] ---[19], [25]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCAFC 7">60 The boundaries of the sufficiency criterion have been discussed in various cases. In Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Ltd [1996] FCA 391 , Lindgren J held that r 6 was not necessarily rendered unavailable by the fact that the applicant already had available evidence establishing a prima facie case for the granting of relief. There might be matters of defence which could defeat a prima facie case. In C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864 , Gyles J took the view, for the purposes of O 15A r 6(b), that a party was entitled to have more than a 'bare pleadable case' before deciding whether to undertake lengthy and expensive litigation of the kind contemplated in that case. Tamberlin J appears to have misstated this aspect of the reasons of Gyles J in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2065 when he suggested that O 15A r 6 was 'no longer appropriate' when an applicant had enough information to meet the threshold of a bare pleadable case. However, as his Honour said, the purpose of preliminary discovery is not to procure documents that would strengthen an applicant's decision to commence proceedings but rather to furnish it with information which is reasonably necessary to enable that decision to be made. In that connection he referred to his earlier decision in Matrix Film Investment One Pty Limited v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 2065">27 It is settled law that the purpose of preliminary discovery is not to procure documents that will strengthen an applicant's decision to commence proceedings, but rather to furnish it with information which is reasonably necessary to enable that decision to be made: see Matrix Film Investment One Pty Ltd v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591 at [19] .

Simply because it may be difficult to ascertain the finer detail of those pleadings and assess with accuracy the likelihood of success does not mean the prospects of success in the litigation should be amplified for the prospective applicant through the effects of an invasive order for preliminary discovery. An applicant which is unsuccessful in its preliminary discovery application can always plead its case as best it can, acquire further information and documentation through the ordinary processes of discovery and issue of subpoenas, and then, if necessary, amend its pleadings to assert further or different breaches of its rights or abandon any grounds or causes of action no longer considered tenable.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1348">6 Despite the narrower scope of pre-action discovery and the different questions to which it relates, an estimation of the strength of a prospective case including consideration of possible defences may be material. Pre-action discovery is only directed to provide evidence sufficient to enable an applicant to decide whether to commence the proceedings . The sufficiency of this evidence need not go so far as to enable the applicant to decide there is a prima facie case or to evaluate the prospects of success on the ultimate hearing at any high level of probability. Pre-action discovery is not designed to enhance or justify a decision which has already been taken to commence proceedings: see Matrix Film Investment One Pty Ltd v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591. The focus of this form of discovery is on the question whether the requirements of O 15A r 6(a), (b) and (c) have been made out and, if so, whether the Court should exercise its discretion to require production. In discovery after an action has been commenced, the question is whether there are documents relevant to the matters and issues raised on the pleadings, including but not limited to those referred to in O 15 r 2(3). Any determination of an application for pre-action discovery must be made having regard to these considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] NSWSC 562">33 The onus is on the plaintiffs to make it appear to the Court that, having made reasonable inquiries, they are unable to obtain sufficient information to decide whether or not to commence proceedings against Nylex. The third requirement of r 5.3(1)(a) requires an objective assessment of the information already possessed by the plaintiffs to determine whether that information is sufficient for such a decision to be made.
