<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 334">The parties filed written submissions in relation to costs. I do not propose to summarise the competing submissions though I will endeavour to deal in these reasons with the various propositions they advanced. The principles concerning the exercise of the power to award costs are well settled. A helpful recent decision in which many of the applicable principles are discussed in a broadly analogous case and referred to by the respondents in their submissions is the judgement of Jagot J in Haviv Holdings Pty Ltd v Howards Storage World Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 652 together with the judgement of the Full Court on appeal: Howards Storage World Pty Ltd v Haviv Holdings Pty Ltd [2010] FCAFC 5 ; (2010) 182 FCR 84. Having regard to the relationship between Mr Garrard and the corporate respondents discussed in the earlier reasons it is appropriate to treat the respondents as one for the purposes of determining where, in principle, the benefit and burden of costs orders might lie though they should be treated separately in relation to the actual liability to pay costs. The respondents have been represented by the same solicitors and counsel. I accept, of course, that I cannot ignore the fact that Entirity prosecuted, in the proceedings, different causes of action (both common law and statutory) against different respondents. Entirity succeeded in its contractual claim against Garsoft but failed in its claim against Mr Garrard under the Corporations Law and the Fair Trading Act and its claim under the Copyright Act against Garsoft and Scion. I put to one side, for the moment, Garsoft's cross-claim. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1096">I summarised the general principles relevant to costs in Haviv Holdings Pty Limited v Howards Storage World Pty Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 652 as follows: 
 
 [7] The award of costs is discretionary (s 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)). The discretion is broad but not unconfined. It is a judicial discretion to be exercised on a principled basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 973">There does not appear to be any significant difference between the parties as to the applicable principles. In respect of the costs issue reference has been made to section 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), conferring jurisdiction on the Court to award costs. In Haviv Holdings Pty Limited v Howards Storage Work Pty Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 652 , Jagot J stated the applicable principles in her reasons for judgment at [7] --- [11] as follows: 
 
 '7 The award of costs is discretionary (s 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)). The discretion is broad but not unconfined. It is a judicial discretion to be exercised on a principled basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCAFC 5">6 The question of costs was then argued. On 17 June 2009, the primary judge delivered judgment on that question and made orders. See Haviv Holdings Pty Limited v Howards Storage World Pty Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 652. Her Honour made three specific orders as to costs. First, Howards, Plaza and Mr Spence were ordered to pay costs incurred by Haviv and Mr Aghion by reason of the adjournment of the hearing of the proceeding on 30 October 2008. Second, Haviv and Mr Aghion were ordered to pay the costs of Howards, Plaza and Mr Spence in so far as those costs were incurred in relation to two specific claims that had been abandoned by Haviv and Mr Aghion. Third, Haviv and Mr Aghion were also ordered to pay the costs of Plaza and Mr Spence, but only in so far as those costs were incurred solely by reason of the joinder of Plaza and Mr Spence to the proceeding. Such costs were not to include any costs jointly incurred by Howards, Plaza and Mr Spence. Subject to those specific orders, her Honour ordered Howards to pay the costs of the proceeding of both Haviv and Mr Aghion. 30 This is an appeal from a judge of this Court against orders as to costs: Haviv Holdings Pty Limited v Howards Storage World Pty Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 652 ('the costs judgment'). There was no appeal from the anterior judgment: Haviv Holdings Pty Limited v Howards Storage World Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 242 ; (2009) 254 ALR 273 ('the substantive judgment').
