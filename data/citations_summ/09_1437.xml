<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1169">The respondents say that the mere fact that, as here, two companies have a common director is not sufficient to make them joint tortfeasors in respect of patent infringement and refer to what Wilcox J said in BEST Australia Ltd v Aquagas Marketing Pty Ltd (1988) 12 IPR 143 to the effect that to find the contrary on this basis would be to give insufficient weight to the fact that two companies are separate legal entities. More must be found to make out joint tortfeasorship where in effect one tort is committed by one party on behalf of and in concert with the other. The respondents adopt as relevant the approach applied by Flick J in AMI Australia Holdings Pty Ltd v Bade Medical Institute (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 1437 ; (2009) 262 ALR 458 , at [97] (citing Thompson ), that "there must be a concurrence in the act or acts causing damage, not merely a coincidence of separate acts which by their conjoined effect cause damage". </sentence>

In other cases, however, Judges have noted the existence of the two competing tests, and decided the matters before them without the need to resolve the uncertainty: see Wellness Pty Ltd v Pro Bio Living Waters Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 438 ; (2004) 61 IPR 242 , 249-250 [38]-[39]; Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1123 ; (2004) 210 ALR 244 ; AMI Australia Holdings Pty Ltd v Bade Medical Institute (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 1437 , [96]-[105].</sentence>
