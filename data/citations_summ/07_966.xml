<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1379">There can be no doubt that the Court has power to recall and reconsider reasons which it has given. That power must be exercised sparingly and in the interests of justice. In Nutrasweet Australia Pty Ltd v Ajinomoto Co Inc (No 3) ; [2007] FCA 966 ; (2007) 73 IPR 282 at [12] Finkelstein J said: 
 
 "The power to reopen a case is not in doubt. It is, however, a power that must be exercised sparingly, having regard to the public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation. Smith v New South Wales Bar Association (No 2) [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 176 CLR 256 at 265. Still, there are occasions in which it is both appropriate and fair to allow further argument and even further evidence in a case before it is finally disposed of. For example, if it turns out that a court finds that the unsuccessful party has not had the clear and adequate opportunity to argue its case, there might be a denial of procedural fairness if the case were not reopened: Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 309. It would also be appropriate to reopen if it were clear that the court had proceeded "on a misapprehension as to the facts or the law", especially where the misapprehension was the result of accident or oversight and not the fault of the party seeking to reopen the case: De L v Director-General, NSW Department of Community Services (No 2) (1997) 190 CLR 207. "

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1387">7 Although Aristocrat was an intellectual property case and I am here concerned with the administration of a bankrupt estate and related matters, I consider that the principles outlined by Allsop J provide appropriate general guidance as to the approach to be taken on the present motions. In particular I proceed on the basis that a party who seeks an order that I withdraw and reconsider any part of the reasons for judgment earlier published by me must demonstrate why the interests of justice suggest that this would be an appropriate course for me to adopt. Mere discontent with an aspect of my published reasons for judgment is not sufficient to override the public interest in the finality of litigation. I find support for the above conclusion in Nutrasweet Australia Pty Ltd v Ajinomoto Co Inc (No 3) [2007] FCA 966 ; (2007) 73 IPR 282 at [12] where Finkelstein J said:

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 34">1 There are two appeals presently before this Court. The first appeal (VID 731 of 2007) is against the primary judge's order that Ajinomoto Co Inc's patent number 727199 be revoked: NutraSweet Australia Pty Ltd v Ajinomoto Co Inc [2005] FCA 1524 ; (2005) 224 ALR 200 ("the revocation judgment"). The second appeal (VID 608 of 2007) is against his Honour's subsequent rejection of the appellant's application to amend its patent: NutraSweet Australia Pty Ltd v Ajinomoto Co Inc (No 3) [2007] FCA 966 ("the amendment judgment"). </sentence>
