<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 1339">96 The decisions of Bergin J (as her Honour then was) in Actwane Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager Appointed) (In Liquidation) and William James Moss v Hotel Redfern Pty Ltd, Actwane Holdings Pty Ltd and Stephen Michael Larkin [2002] NSWSC 265 and Emmett J in Rafeletos v Great Wall Resources Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1395 seem to me to be relevant on this issue. They suggest that, whilst the onus does ultimately lie with the person claiming rectification, if particular factual issues are asserted by the defendant (by way of the defences raised) then an evidentiary onus may nonetheless fall upon the defence to prove those issues, failing which the plaintiff's evidence in favour of rectification may be sufficient to support the relief sought. </sentence>
