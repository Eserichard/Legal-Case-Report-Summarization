 As identified in many cases, a ground of challenge to an administrative decision based on manifest unreasonableness grounded in Wednesbury is confined and the criteria must be stringently applied; see Weal v Bathurst City Council at [27] per Mason P, Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 , Westfield Management Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Company Limited and Anor [2006] NSWCA 245 per Tobias JA at [71].

In Wednesbury itself, which was concerned with an issue as to whether the imposition of a condition imposed by a licensing authority was so unreasonable as to be beyond the proper exercise of the authority's powers, Lord Greene MR said that what a court may consider unreasonable is a very different thing from "something overwhelming" such that it means that a decision was one that no reasonable body could have come to. As Mason J pointed out in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd , when the ground of asserted unreasonableness is giving too much or too little weight to one consideration or another "a court should proceed with caution ... lest it exceed its supervisory role by reviewing the decision on its merits". This was cited in Save Our Street by Biscoe J at [31] with approval.

Where the law requires the executive branch of government, such as the Commission, to do something to give effect to the intention of the Parliament, the executive must obey the law, just like every other member of the community, be it a corporation or individual.

13 The appellant submitted that his Honour was too generous to the Tribunal. While it is true that the Tribunal has exposed its reasoning process as to why it considered the appellant's account to be implausible, the appellant submitted that it is this very reasoning process which is flawed. The Tribunal reasoned that it was not plausible for the appellant to escape the attention of the police by giving them an address that was 30 kilometres distant from where he actually lived. However, the appellant's submission is that the explanation was not implausible. The Tribunal simply asserted that it was and cited no evidence to support the reasoning. The appellant argued that to simply make an assertion to support a finding which does not otherwise flow from the material is simply not a sufficient basis: SZEJF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 724 at [59] ; Tran v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1229 at [17] .

Justice Besanko was of the view, consistent with Allsop J in SZEEU , that relief may be refused if, irrespective of any question of procedural fairness or individual merits, the decision-maker was bound by the governing statute to refuse the application (at [32]). In the present case, as in Wang , the Tribunal was so bound and it was not possible that the Tribunal would reach a different result (cf Tran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1229 ; (2006) 154 FCR 536).

We respectfully submit that the Tribunal Member's interpretation during the hearing of the requirements of Regulation 1.11(b) was beyond that which the Regulation requires. As to the meaning of Regulation 1.11(b), we refer to the Federal Court of Australia case of Tran v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1229 (12 September 2006) which, in reference to the Full Federal Court case of Lobo v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 168 , Justice Rares stated at paragraph 8 that:
 
 
The Full Court held, following a concession by the Minister, that the requirements of the identically worded policy did not correspond to the requirements of the Regulations. The court said (132 FCR at 112 [63]) that:
 
.. the departmental policy ... was narrower than the criterion for a subclass 845 visa set out in cl 845.216 .... The criterion requires satisfaction on the part of the Minister that the applicant for the visa as owner of and interested in a main business "maintain direct and continuous involvement in the management of that business or in those businesses from day to day and in making decisions that affected the overall direction and performance of that business or those businesses.</sentence>
