<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 614">The medical certificate is quite unsatisfactory. It does not address the critical question of whether, and if so why, the medical condition would prevent the applicant from travelling to Court and participating effectively in a Court hearing. Indeed, the certificate makes no mention of the applicant's obligation to attend Court this morning and to suggest that she is unfit to do so for any specified and identified medical condition (See MZXJN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1624 ; NAKX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1559). 13. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that Exhibit 2R satisfactorily excuses the applicant from attendance at Court this morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 415">There has been no communication received by this Court from the applicant seeking an adjournment of today's scheduled hearing for any reason. The medical certificate is quite unsatisfactory. It does not address the critical question of whether, and if so why, the medical condition would prevent the applicant from travelling to Court and participating effectively in a Court hearing. Indeed, the certificate makes no mention of the applicant's obligation to attend Court this morning and to suggest that she is unfit to do so for any specified and identified medical condition (See MZXJN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1624 ; NAKX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1559). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1729">The same approach was adopted by Justice Middleton in MZXJN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1624 at paragraph 13. His Honour followed the decision in NAKX and dismissed the appeal with costs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 1974">The same approach was adopted by Middleton J in the case of MZXJN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1624 at [13] . Also, in NALM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 17 , the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia observed in that case that the medical certificate does not identify the 'medical condition' or explain why it would prevent the appellant from participating effectively in a hearing... 
The Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia refused to grant an adjournment. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 385">2 On this application I need to consider two matters: (a) whether the applicant has an arguable case; and (b) whether the applicant has provided a satisfactory explanation for non-attendance. I refer generally to the discussion in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 per Jacobson J. The background to this application and the applicant's grounds of appeal filed on 18 August 2006 are set out in my reasons for judgment previously delivered on 21 November 2006: see MZXJN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1624. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 1688">9 In the days preceding the hearing, Mr Jewiss through a corporation sent to the Court (but not to the Commissioner's legal representatives) medical certificates indicating that he was unfit for work by reason of illness for the period from 6 to 20 November 2006. He did not attend the hearing. He sent a letter to the Court indicating that he would be unable to do so because of illness. There is no further medical evidence to indicate his ongoing incapacity for work after 20 November 2006, or more importantly, any medical evidence stating that he was unfit to appear in Court on 20 November 2006 to conduct the proceedings or to appear in Court to support any application for an adjournment: see e.g. the remarks of Middleton J in MZXJN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1624 at [13] - [14], adopting the words of Lindgren J in NAKX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1559. There is no detailed medical report from any medical practitioner.</sentence>
