<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] FCA 671">17 The power to award costs against a legal practitioner under O 62 r 9 was recently considered by Weinberg J in Tran v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 199. In that case his Honour delivered judgment refusing an application for an extension of time within which to appeal against a decision of a Federal Magistrate. The question with which his Honour dealt in his subsequent judgment in the matter was whether the applicant's solicitor should be ordered, under O 62 r 9(1)(c) of the Federal Court Rules , to repay to the applicant some portion of the costs that the applicant had been ordered to pay to the respondent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FMCA 390">
 (5) Before making an order for costs, the Court or Registrar: 
 (a) must give the lawyer, and any other person who may be affected by the decision, a reasonable opportunity to be heard; and 
 (b) may order that notice of the order, or of any proceeding against the lawyer be given to a party for whom the lawyer may be acting or any other person. 
 
 
 14. Guidance on the Court's powers to make such orders can be gleaned from the following authorities to which I have had regard: Myers v Elman [1939] 4 All ER 484 ; Riv-Oland Marble Co (Vic) Pty Ltd v Settef S P A (1989) 63 ALJR 519 ; De Sousa v Minister for Immigration &amp; Local Government &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1993] FCA 146 ; (1993) 41 FCR 544 ; Re Bendeich [1994] FCA 1504 ; (1994) 126 ALR 643 ; Leicester v Walton (New South Wales Court of Appeal, 22 November 1995, unreported); Wentworth v Rogers [1999] NSWCA 403 ; SZABF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs No 2 [2003] FMCA 178 ; Kumar v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No.2) [2004] FCA 18 ; Baik &amp; Hankuk Grocery Pty Ltd v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 543 ; MZWOR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 845 ; Tran v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 199. 15. The power to make a costs order directly against a solicitor is an inherent power of the Court.</sentence>
