<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] ACAT 64">There have been various standards stated in the case law as to what test applies when proceedings are alleged to be frivolous or vexatious. For example that the proceedings are "foredoomed to fail", [25] where the claim is without substance, groundless or fanciful, [26] clearly untenable, [27] baseless [28] or where the claim discloses no cause of action or no justiciable legal controversy. [29] In Re McIntyre &amp; Comcare Australia [30] the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal noted that a power expressed in similar terms to s 32 of the ACAT Act was granted to the Tribunal for the purpose of saving resources. The High Court opined in AON Risk Services v ANU [31] that court and tribunal resources are a relevant consideration for case management decisions, and the present Tribunal considers that such resources may be a relevant consideration in applying 
section 32 of the ACAT Act. </sentence>
