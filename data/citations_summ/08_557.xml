<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 22">7 The Holding Trust and the Investment Trust are both listed widely held trusts. In a private ruling the Commissioner ruled that the Subsidiary Trust did not, by virtue of s 272-127, acquire the status of listed widely held trust. An objection to that ruling was disallowed. An appeal to this Court was dismissed: ConnectEast Management Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 557. This appeal is from that dismissal.</sentence>
