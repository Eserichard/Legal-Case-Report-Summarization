<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1437">Considerable reservation has been previously expressed as to the medical evidence sought to be relied upon by the Fourth Respondent when seeking a vacation of the December 2008 hearing dates: AMI Australia Holdings [2008] FCA 1783 at [8] to [11].  The hearing was initially set down for final hearing in December 2008. An application made prior to that date by the Fourth Respondent for the vacation of those dates was rejected: AMI Australia Holdings Pty Limited v Bade Medical Institute (Aust) Pty Limited [2008] FCA 1783. But the final hearing did not in any event proceed in December 2008 because of the absence of the Fifth Respondent. She was unfit to attend because she had recently undergone dental treatment. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 303">As Counsel for the Respondents submitted, not only did JL Holdings not support the granting of the adjournment in the circumstances of the present proceeding but there is a vast body of authority in this Court where applications for adjournments have been refused where the Applicant for the adjournment was in a far better position than the current Applicant: for example, in Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 102 at [13] - [20] per Finkelstein J (giving the judgment of the Court on the grounds of the application) an application for adjournment was refused where there was evidence of lack of funds and lack of necessary documentation to prosecute the appeal. See also AMI Australia Holdings Pty Ltd v Bade Medical Institute (Aust) Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1783 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1628 ; Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd v Elderslie Finance Corporation Ltd [2008] FCA 1045 ; Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 1179 ; Vescio v Hon Kristina Keneally [2008] FCA 589 ; Westpac Banking Corporation v Tsatsoulis [2003] FCA 406. By way of contrast, an adjournment was granted in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 920 , where substantial evidence was led that thousands of pages of documents were provided to the Applicant on the eve of the trial as annexures to affidavits in circumstances where the Applicant could not reasonably have read these documents or be certain that relevant discovery had been completed. That is a long way removed from this case: see [22] to [26] above. </sentence>
