<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 279">I may not, however, stop here. Where a positive defence is mounted, the question arises as to whether that conclusion should be qualified by the apparent strength of the defence: Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498 ; (2008) 79 IPR 261 at [17] ( "Interpharma" ). Here, Woolworths has indicated it proposes to raise a defence under s 122(1) of the Trade Marks Act , which relevantly provides, 
 
 In spite of section 120 , a person does not infringe a registered trade mark when:
 ...
 (b) the person uses a sign in good faith to indicate:
 (i) the... quality, ...[or] value... of goods or services... 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 32">Much of the expert evidence and many of the submissions concerned the alleged infringement and invalidity of the patent in the context of the question whether the Aventis parties had established a serious question to be tried. In this regard all parties relied on the analysis of Jessup J in Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents (2008) 79 IPR 261 ; [2008] FCA 1498 at [17] as follows: 
 
 Another layer of complication is added to the deliberative exercise in cases in which the respondent (that is the non-moving party) goes further than a denial of the applicant's case for relief, and pleads a positive point of defence. In such a situation, it will not be enough to ask whether the applicant has shown a serious question, or a probability of success, on his or her own case. While the answer to that question may be in the affirmative, it will then be necessary to consider whether that answer should be qualified by the apparent strength of the defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1366">On an application for an interlocutory restraint such as the present, there are two main inquiries which the Court should undertake: first, whether the applicants have established a prima facie case, and secondly whether the inconvenience which the applicants would be likely to suffer if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury which the respondent would suffer if an injunction were granted: Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 , 622-623; Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 , 81-82[65]. As to the first inquiry, "it is sufficient that the [applicants] show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial. ": ABC v O'Neill at 82[65]. In a patent case which involves a challenge to validity by way of defence --- 
 
 ... unless the case for invalidity is sufficiently strong (at the provisional level) to qualify the conclusion that, overall, the applicant has a serious question, or a probability of success, the court should move to consider the adequacy of damages, the balance of convenience and other discretionary matters. It is the applicant's title to interlocutory relief which is under consideration, and the bottom-line question, as it were, is whether the applicant has a serious question, or a probability of success, not whether the respondent does in relation to some point of defence raised or foreshadowed. 
 

 
 Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498 ; (2008) 79 IPR 261 , 267. It was common ground that I should take this approach in the present case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 945">Gummow J's analysis has been applied by Moore J in Merck and Co Inc v GenRx Pty Ltd (2006) 70 IPR 286 ; [2006] FCA 1407 , Gyles J in GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis (2007) 73 IPR 502 ; [2007] FCA 1485 , Jessup J in Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents (2008) 79 IPR 261 ; [2008] FCA 1498 and, of course, Sundberg J in the Sigma decision.  At one level of generality, the parties were on common ground. Hence, they did not debate the correctness of Sundberg J's description in the Sigma decision of the applicable principles relating to interlocutory injunctions generally at [14]-[15] as follows: 
 [ 14 ] The general principles to be applied are: 

 
 (a) whether there is a serious question to be tried, or Wyeth has made out a prima facie case in the sense that, if the evidence remains the same, there is a probability that at trial it will be entitled to relief; 

 
 (b) whether Wyeth will suffer irreparable harm, for which damages will not be an adequate remedy, unless an injunction is granted; and 

 
 (c) whether the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction. 

 
 See Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 (O 'Neill) at [19] and [70]. 

 
 [ 15 ] Factors (a) and (c) are related in this sense, that whether there is a serious question or a prima facie case should not be considered in isolation from the balance of convenience. The apparent strength of the parties' substantive cases will often be an important consideration to be weighed in the balance: Tidy Tea Ltd v Unilever Australia Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 405 at [416]; Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498 ; (2008) 79 IPR 261 ( Interpharma ) at [16]. 

  There was a debate about the observation in [16] of Sundberg J's reasons, where his Honour said: 
 [16] Special considerations apply where, as here, the party seeking interlocutory relief alleges infringement and the other party alleges invalidity. As to this, in Interpharma [2008] FCA 1498 ; 79 IPR 261 at [17] Jessup J said: 

 
In such a situation, it will not be enough to ask whether the applicant has shown a serious question, or a probability of success, on his or her own case. While the answer to that question may be in the affirmative, it will then be necessary to consider whether that answer should be qualified by the apparent strength of the defence. In a patent case, the fact of registration constitutes prima facie evidence of validity: AB Hassle v Pharmacia (Aust) Pty Ltd (1995) 33 IPR 63 at 69-70 ( AB Hassle ); GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 ... at [2]-[6] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 949">The practice to which their Honours referred is no longer the practice of the courts. This much appears from the authorities to which counsel for the applicants referred me, including AB Hassle v Pharmacia (Australia) Pty Ltd (1995) 33 IPR 63 , Genrx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 , and Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498 ; (2008) 79 IPR 261. The reason for the change in practice is that the legislative requirements for grant of a patent are more exacting than they once were and include provision for opposition proceedings before the grant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 630">As already mentioned, interlocutory relief of the type sought by the applicants is primarily directed to preserving the status quo; see O'Neill , supra, at 82 [65] and Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498 per Jessup J, at [72] et seq. My findings on the first two factors afford powerful reasons for preferring an interim maintenance of KCIM's monopoly of NPWT foam dressings over allowing what may be a temporary incursion into the market by Smith &amp; Nephew. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 595">The purpose of an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo pending trial. What was said by Gyles J in GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 at [15] is applicable here. A new entrant into the market would have an effect which may be both unpredictable and irreversible. Once Sigma is in the market, it is likely that other generic manufacturers will also come in. I doubt whether, if Sigma is not restrained and Wyeth succeeds at trial, Wyeth will ever be able to resume the position it now occupies. Cf Interpharma [2008] FCA 1498 ; 79 IPR 261 at [71] . In my view it is likely that Wyeth will suffer irreparable harm for which damages will not adequately compensate it, unless an injunction is granted.  Factors (a) and (c) are related in this sense, that whether there is a serious question or a prima facie case should not be considered in isolation from the balance of convenience. The apparent strength of the parties' substantive cases will often be an important consideration to be weighed in the balance: Tidy Tea Ltd v Unilever Australia Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 405 at [416]; Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498 ; (2008) 79 IPR 261 ( Interpharma ) at [16].  A similar situation existed in Interpharma [2008] FCA 1498 ; 79 IPR 261 where the alleged infringer had proceeded with its preparations to enter the market "with its eyes wide open". Jessup J said at [77] that this significantly compromised that party's attempt to resist an injunction which went no further than to maintain the status quo. See also Pharmacia Italia 67 IPR 397 at [38] and Merck &amp; Co Inc v GenRx Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1407 ; (2006) 70 IPR 286 at [19] .  Special considerations apply where, as here, the party seeking interlocutory relief alleges infringement and the other party alleges invalidity. As to this, in Interpharma [2008] FCA 1498 ; 79 IPR 261 at [17] Jessup J said: 
 In such a situation, it will not be enough to ask whether the applicant has shown a serious question, or a probability of success, on his or her own case. While the answer to that question may be in the affirmative, it will then be necessary to consider whether that answer should be qualified by the apparent strength of the defence. In a patent case, the fact of registration constitutes prima facie evidence of validity: AB Hassle v Pharmacia (Aust) Pty Ltd (1995) 33 IPR 63 at 69-70 ( AB Hassle ); GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 ... at [2]-[6] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 313">The observations of Jessup J in Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498 at [71] --- [73] recognise the difficulties which may arise in restoring a patentee to the position it occupies as the only supplier of the product in the event that the patent holder succeeds at the final hearing but is denied interlocutory relief. </sentence>
