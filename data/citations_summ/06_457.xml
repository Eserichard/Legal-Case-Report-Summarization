<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 1595">The only explanation possibly put forward by the applicant to explain this delay of 2 years and 3 months is if the Court were to read his statement of "application to the Minister" in context as perhaps a request to the Minister pursuant to s.417 of the Act , for the Minister's intervention, following the unsuccessful conclusion to the applicant's involvement in the "class actions". 131. I take the view that if this is indeed what the applicant is seeking to put to the Court, then any pursuit of any such request is not in my view a sufficient explanation for the delay in this case (See the Full Federal Court in M211 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCAFC 293 ; (2004) 212 ALR 520 and subsequently S58 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 283 and SZGZW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 457 and M206 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 24 which involved circumstances similar to those before the Court now --- the applicant in that case had been involved in the " Lie " class action and then pursued a request pursuant to s.417 of the Act ). The Court held that the explanation for the delay was less than satisfactory, although that case was resolved on the lack of the prospects of success in the application --- see [18] and [20], and SZGPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 683 at [25]- [26]. 1.</sentence>

Relevantly, if at the time of making the decision, the applicant is advised by a firm of solicitors and does not give evidence as to some other reason for the delay, then the inference may be drawn that he accepts the Tribunal's decision (at [11]). 2) In SZGZW v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 457 , Jacobson J. accepted the approach in S58 of 2003 (at [42]). (I should just note that, in that case, Jacobson J. allowed the appeal from the dismissal of the application on the ground of delay because he was not satisfied that there was evidence before the Federal Magistrates Court as to the date on which the appellant became aware of the Tribunal's decision). 3) In M206 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 24 , Goldberg J. held that an explanation for delay was less than satisfactory in circumstances where an applicant, having been involved in a class action, then made a request pursuant to s.417 of the Act, with a delay of nine months awaiting the outcome, and then lodged an application for review in the Federal Magistrate's Court, with a total period of delay from the date of the Tribunal's decision being just over three years.</sentence>

It was submitted in that regard that by obtaining the husband/father's explanation for the relevant delay in that manner, the Federal Magistrate was putting himself 'in the position of an advocate or an inquisitor and...that [that] process [was] not sufficiently judicial...'. In support of that submission, reliance was placed on what appears from the unreported reasons for judgment of Jacobson J in SZGZW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 457 , where at [45], his Honour observed, in relation to a delay of eight years from 1996 to 2005 in applying for review of an adverse Tribunal decision, as follows: 
 
 It follows from what I have said, that the discretion to refuse relief miscarried within the well known principle stated in House v R [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. It was not open to the learned Federal Magistrate to find that the appellant's delay was lengthy or unsatisfactory upon the basis of untested statements made from the bar table. '
