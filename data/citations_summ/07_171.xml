<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] AATA 1380">Usually applications are made to declare proceedings frivolous and vexatious when attempts are made to re-litigate proceedings that have been reviewed or decided or where, in extreme cases, there is a habitual or persistent or frequent attempt to enliven proceedings that are utterly hopeless or annoying (refer Freeman v National Australia Bank Ltd [2006] FCAFC 67 ; Ramsay v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; Singh v Secretary Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 90 ; Theo and Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 171). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] AATA 1210">Mr Theo is wrong. The legislation he referred to does not have the effect of creating an enforceable contract. But even if I thought his argument had merit --- and I do not --- I would be obliged to reject it because the Federal Court has already considered and rejected the same argument in Theo v Secretary, Department of Family &amp; Community Services [2005] FCA 880 , Theo v Department of Family and Community Services [2005] FCAFC 239 and --- most recently --- in Theo v Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 171.  As a consequence, the Secretary does not have sufficient information to enable him to form an opinion pursuant to ss 36 and 37 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 that Mr Theo is qualified to receive the payment he seeks. He was given ample opportunity to provide that additional information at the hearing. I quoted the remarks of Spender J in Theo v Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 171 at [14] exhorting him to adopt a more compliant attitude, but Mr Theo was unmoved. I have therefore decided to affirm the decision under review. 
I certify that the 25 preceding paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for the decision herein of Senior Member Bernard J McCabe.</sentence>
