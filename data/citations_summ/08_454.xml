<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1586">Since Anaconda was decided by the Court of Appeal on 17 February 2000 it has been cited, considered or applied without disapproval in a number of contract law cases involving questions of incompleteness or uncertainty, for example: Duskwood Pty Ltd v Bellara Willows Pty Ltd [2001] per Steytler J at [95]; Liristis Holdings Pty Ltd v Wallville Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 428 per Barrett J at [38]; African Minerals Limited v Pan Palladium Limited [2003] NSWSC 268 per Einstein J at [26]; Thompson v White &amp; Ors [2006] NSWCA 350 per Tobias JA with whom Ipp and McColl JJA agreed at [100]; Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair [2008] NSWCA 248 per Giles JA with whom McColl JA and Young CJ in EQ agreed at [27]-[28]; Donald Fin Enterprises Pty Ltd v APIR Systems Ltd [2008] FCA 454 ; (2008) 67 ACSR 219 per Edmonds J at [131]-[132]; Strzelecki Holdings Pty Ltd v Cable Sands Pty Ltd [No 3] [2009] WASC 352 per Murray J at [90]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 190">1 The question on appeal may be simply stated: are compensatory damages for defamation received by a corporation "income according to ordinary concepts" and assessable under s 6-5 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ("the ITAA97") if calculated solely by reference to lost profits attributable to the defamatory publications? The learned primary judge answered that question in the negative, allowing the appeal of the respondent taxpayer, Sydney Refractive Surgery Centre Pty Ltd ("SRSC"), against the disallowance of its objection to the decision of the appellant, the Commissioner of Taxation ("the Commissioner"), that the sum of $812,726.00 received by SRSC in compensatory damages for defamation was assessable: Sydney Refractive Surgery Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 454 ; (2008) 247 ALR 313. We agree the answer to the question presented is no. Whether a payment of compensatory damages is assessable must be determined by looking to the nature of the cause of action in respect of which the payment is made, rather than the way in which damages are calculated. Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.  10 In the meantime, the proper test was and remains to look at the character of the payment in the hands of the taxpayer: [2008] FCA 454 ; (2008) 247 ALR 313 at [45] and the authorities there cited. For an award of damages, that in turn requires an examination of the nature of the claim or cause of action in respect of which the payment was made. It is settled that an award of damages for personal injuries is not taxable: [2008] FCA 454 ; (2008) 247 ALR 313 at [65] and authorities there cited.  10 In the meantime, the proper test was and remains to look at the character of the payment in the hands of the taxpayer: [2008] FCA 454 ; (2008) 247 ALR 313 at [45] and the authorities there cited.

This would deny finality to the party liable for the damages, because the full extent of the liability might not be known for years. Secondly, acceptance of the Commissioner's contention would encourage plaintiffs to withhold evidence and reframe damages claims in ways that might reduce the accuracy of the awards. Rather than leading evidence and making claims calculated by reference to lost profits, plaintiffs would have an interest in asking the courts to make at large awards based on estimates and undifferentiated lump sum awards encompassing both economic and non-economic loss so that they could avoid taxes: [2008] FCA 454 ; (2008) 247 ALR 313 at [43] , [56]. Encouraging the calculation or specification of damages with less accuracy is not in the interests of the parties or of justice generally. Finally, the adoption of a fuzzy standard would increase the work of the Commissioner and the courts - many cases would lead to a private ruling request as to assessability or an objection decision, as well as possible requests for judicial review. 14 In contrast, an injury that does not impair the plaintiff corporation's ability to earn, but instead simply frustrates its receipt of certain moneys (ie reduces its revenue) will be assessable. For example, suppose B trespasses on A's factory grounds, erecting a roadblock so that raw materials cannot be delivered, and A claims damages in respect of the diminished output (ie for the loss of use of the factory during the period of the roadblock). Or suppose that A has a contract for the supply of widgets by B, but C tortiously interferes and prevents the delivery, and A then claims damages based on the resale price of the widgets. In those cases, a damages award is not only measured by lost profits but is for lost profits (ie a substitute for revenue not received), and will therefore be assessable as income. This is the principle to be gleaned from London and Thames Haven Oil Wharves Ltd v Attwooll [1967] 2 All ER 124 , and Liftronic Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 66 FCR 175. However, as the learned primary judge correctly noted ((2008) [2008] FCA 454 ; 247 ALR 313 at [72] - [76]), that principle does not apply here because a claim for defamation damages based on an injury to business reputation is a claim, regardless of how measured, for compensation for lost earning capacity resulting from damage to a capital asset.  12 We do not accept the Commissioner's proposed distinction because it fails to give sufficient, or even any, proper consideration to the injury for which compensation is being paid. Instead, we agree with the learned trial judge that an award of damages in a defamation claim "is, in point of principle, for impairment of the plaintiff's earning capacity and not for loss of income as such": [2008] FCA 454 ; (2008) 247 ALR 313 at [69] . To put it another way, a corporation's business reputation, although not precisely the same as its goodwill, is in the nature of a capital asset: United States v Kaiser [1960] USSC 93 ; 363 US 299 , 311 (1960) (acknowledging that the relevant principle remains that compensation for an injury to something that is not a part of gross income is not taxable, notwithstanding any difficulties in the application of that principle to something like reputation which is not an ordinary capital asset); Welch v Helvering [1933] USSC 140 ; 290 US 111 , 115 (1933) (Cardozo J) ("Reputation and learning are akin to capital assets, like the good will of an old partnership. "); Z-Tel Communications Inc v SBC Communications Inc 331 FSupp2d 513 , 533 (ED Tex 2004) ("Reputation is a very real capital asset to a business firm. ") citing Richard A Posner , Economic Analysis of Law at 230 (5 th ed, 1998) ("[R]eputation is a basis for inducing others to engage in market or nonmarket transactions with you. "); see also Tourism Holdings Australia Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxes (2007) 210 FLR 80 at [23] ("A company's good reputation in an area where it does not carry on business is like a capital asset which has yet to be put to work. "); Upenieks v Canada [1995] 1 CTC 8D at [4]-[5] (acknowledging that professional reputation is a capital asset); Whyte v Morin [2008] BCWLD 3470 at [80] (finding that professional reputation is a capital asset and that injury to reputation impairs future earning capacity).  3 In the Supreme Court proceedings, the jury found that the defendants had defamed SRSC by publishing false and misleading statements in April and May 1998 about the nature and quality of laser eye surgery services provided by SRSC. After a separate hearing on quantum which was concluded in 2004, Studdert J assessed damages on a lost profits basis by: (1) determining the number of surgical procedures that SRSC would have performed but for the adverse impact of the defamatory publications; (2) multiplying that number by the average gross revenue per procedure to establish the total lost gross revenue; (3) subtracting the costs that would have been incurred by SRSC in performing those procedures in order to establish the total lost net revenue; and (4) subtracting the amount that SRSC would have had to pay in taxes on that net revenue in order to determine total lost profits. Although SRSC also put its damages case on a reduction in value (ie lost goodwill) basis, the trial judge noted that SRSC had stopped trading in 1999 and that, in the absence of any sale of the business, there was insufficient evidence of a loss in capital value: [2008] FCA 454 ; (2008) 247 ALR 313 at [23] .  5 As the primary judge in this case noted, if the Commissioner's position as to the assessability of the remaining sum were accepted, it would lead to a result inconsistent with the Supreme Court judgment and would mean, in effect, that SRSC would have to pay tax twice. Although this unfortunate possibility of inconsistent judgments does not eventuate here given the view we have formed, the fact that it exists at all is less than satisfactory. We therefore adopt the primary judge's observation that "[t]his case may be a further illustration of the need to consider procedural changes designed to enable a court to determine the impact of taxation on a damages award once and for all and to encourage the parties to take steps in an appropriate case to ensure that this is done": [2008] FCA 454 ; (2008) 247 ALR 313 at [10] .  2 The relevant facts are not in dispute and were set out at length by the primary judge: [2008] FCA 454 ; (2008) 247 ALR 313 at [11] - [38]. On appeal, only a brief summary is required. On 18 March 2004, the Supreme Court of New South Wales entered judgment for $844,624.00 ("the sum") on a jury verdict in favour of SRSC for defamation: Sydney Refractive Eye Surgery Centre Pty Ltd v Beaumont [2004] NSWSC 164. That sum was paid to SRSC in the 2004 tax year. After the Commissioner included the sum (less $31,898 allowed as costs) as assessable income, SRSC objected. When that objection was disallowed, SRSC instituted these proceedings. </sentence>
