<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 897">The second ground of the application was that the applicant was not provided with procedural fairness because she did not receive the decision letter from the Tribunal. Non-receipt of a decision letter does not give rise to jurisdictional error in the decision itself; SZFLM v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 863. It may have an effect upon the time in which the application was lodged but that is not a relevant matter for this hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1343">30 So too, a failure to comply with a statutory duty to provide reasons after the cancellation of a visa has been held not to be a jurisdictional error: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affair; ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 225-226 [44] - [48] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ, 227-228 [54]-[58] per McHugh J. Similar reasoning applies to the duty to provide reasons in s 430B(6): see SZFLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 863 at [4] per Madgwick J. It follows that although non-compliance with s 430A(4)(b) and s 430B(6)(b) is established no relief can be granted because neither was a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 744">26 In SZFLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 863 (recently applied in SZJHM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1847 and SZKTR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1767) , Madgwick J considered whether the RRT's failure to send the appellant a complete copy of its reasons for decision, in breach of s 430B(6) of the Act, amounted to a reviewable error. The copy of the decision sent to the appellant was missing page five, which set out the RRT's reasons. The incomplete decision record was therefore sufficient to notify the appellant of what decision had been made but not why. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 200">15 On the assumption that page 8 was in fact missing, the Federal Magistrate held that the omission of a page from the reasons for decision did not constitute a jurisdictional error. On this issue, she followed the decision of Madgwick J in SZFLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 863. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 342">In support of that proposition the Minister relies on the decision of Madgwick J in SZFLM v The Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 863. That decision was also recently applied in this Court in SZJHM v The Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 1847 and SZKTR v The Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1767. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 94">The consequences of the applicant not being given a copy of the Tribunal's decision within the s.430B(6) time limit is that time does not commence to run for the commencement of judicial review proceedings. It does not amount to jurisdictional error: SZFLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 863 ; SZKTR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1767. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1767">5 The Federal Magistrate held that the decision had been given to the appellant by the Tribunal posting it to his residential address. Section 441A(4)(b) of the Act requires the decision to be sent by prepaid post or other prepaid means. I can find no evidence in the court book to suggest that it was sent by prepaid means. However, as his Honour observed, a breach of s 430B of the Act does not result in a jurisdictional error but suspends the running of time for the purposes of the statutory time limits for judicial review; see SZFLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 863 , per Madgwick J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FMCA 1847">21. This is so notwithstanding the Tribunal's obligations under s.430B(6) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) to provide the applicant with a full copy of its decision. In that respect I have had regard to the decision of Madgwick J in SZFLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 863. In that case his Honour considered (on appeal from a decision of Federal Magistrate Driver) a similar situation where the Tribunal had failed to send a complete copy of its decision to the appellant. Federal Magistrate Driver had accepted the submission of the first respondent that the only relevant consequence of a breach of s.430B(6) was to suspend the running of time for the purposes of the statutory time limits on judicial review and that no jurisdictional error arose. While Madgwick J suggested that " an unremedied failure to comply with s.430D has consequences other than the postponement of time limits for seeking judicial review " having regard to the fundamental importance to a process of administrative review that an unsuccessful party should be told of the decision in a reasonably timely way (so that, for example, until such time as s.430D had been complied it should not be open to the Minister to seek to have the applicant concerned removed from Australia), such an issue does not in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FMCA 1447">7. That conclusion says nothing about the initial failure by the Tribunal to physically give a copy of its decision and reasons to the applicant. It appears that physical delivery occurred when the applicant visited the Tribunal premises on 12 June 2007. In any event, and consistently with the decision of the Federal Court in SZFLM v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 863 a breach of s.430B(6) of the Migration Act would not constitute jurisdictional error, although it would suspend the running of time for the purposes of s.477 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
