<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 419">Previous judgments in relation to interlocutory applications have recounted the history of the proceedings: Smart Company Pty Ltd v Clipsal Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1008 ; (2008) 249 ALR 388 ; Smart Company Pty Ltd v Clipsal Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1253 ; Smart Company Pty Ltd v Clipsal Australia Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 4. What follows is a summary of that history.  On 3 July 2008 reasons were published for ordering the applicant to pay the costs of its application for leave to file the FFASOC: Smart Company Pty Ltd v Clipsal Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1008 ; (2008) 249 ALR 388. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1253">The history relating to that application is fully described in my reasons for judgment in Smart Company Pty Ltd v Clipsal Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1008 at [2] - [22]. For completeness I include these paragraphs. 
 
 The application seeking leave to amend had its genesis in a notice of motion which was filed on 12 June 2007 in which the applicant sought leave to amend its third further amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1147">23 Even though declaratory and injunctive relief has been granted already, it is not considered that an order would have been made that such costs as are to be paid should be paid forthwith. The conduct of the litigation to date has certainly not been characterised by any degree of expedition; but the hearing of the balance of the proceeding and the resolution of all outstanding issues, it is anticipated, can be accommodated at a comparatively early date: cf Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 952 at [24] per Gordon J; Smart Co Pty Ltd v Clipsal Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1008 at [43] per Lander J. In such circumstances it is not considered that there should be a departure from the general principle that costs should be payable when the rights of the parties -- including any liability in damages -- are finally determined. </sentence>
