<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 568">Considerations relevant to the exercise of discretion to grant or refuse leave are well settled. In the context of considering whether leave to appeal should be granted from a decision of a single Judge of this Court, it has been long-recognised that consideration should be given to: " whether in all the circumstances the judgment of the primary judge is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered "; and " whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision would be wrong ". 
See: Jarrett v Seymour (1993) 46 FCR 557 at 559 per Lockhart and Beaumont JJ; D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 398 to 399; Harrington v Rich [2008] FCAFC 61 at [25] , [2008] FCAFC 61 ; 166 FCR 440 at 446 per Sackville, Emmett and Jacobson JJ. Most recently, in CSR Limited, in the matter of CSR Limited [2010] FCAFC 34 at [5] , Keane CJ and Jacobson J observed that " [g]enerally speaking, leave to appeal will be granted where there is a reasonably arguable case that the decision below is affected by appellable error, and a grant of leave is necessary to remedy a substantial injustice ". The same approach has been applied in the present proceeding when considering whether leave should be granted to appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrate. See SZBUF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 732 at [3] per Conti J; George v Fletcher [2008] FCA 1848 at [14] per Collier J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 53">25 Ms George sought from this Court leave to appeal against the Federal Magistrates Court's refusal on 18 November 2008 to stay its proceedings. That application was, in light of the then imminent substantive hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court, heard urgently. Leave to appeal was refused: George v Fletcher (Trustee) [2008] FCA 1848. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 69">Following application to this Court by the Trustee it was determined that this Court should proceed to determine the Trustee's amended application despite the concurrent Supreme Court proceedings. That decision was affirmed by the Full Court upon appeal following application for leave to appeal and appeal by the bankrupt. [2] </sentence>
