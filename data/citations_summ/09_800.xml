<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 834">This is only the second consent determination in the southern part of the Northern Territory and the third in the whole of the Northern Territory --- I made a consent determination in Elliott last week: see Wilson v Northern Territory [2009] FCA 800. Nonetheless, given the co-operative approach of the legal practitioners and the parties I have mentioned above, I am confident that these two consent determinations will be the first of many that the Court will be making in the Northern Territory in coming months and years. </sentence>
