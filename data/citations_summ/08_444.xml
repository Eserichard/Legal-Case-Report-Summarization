<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 187">21 In short, the Appellants submitted to the primary judge that:
 
(1) s 208-50(2) operated to exclude Austral Holdings becoming a former exempting entity at the time of acquisition by Hastie Holdings of 100% of the issued share capital of Austral Holdings on 6 February 2004: see [2008] FCA 444 at [25] and [40]; and
 
(2) although Austral Holdings became a former exempting entity on 1 November 2002 by force of the rule in item 1 of s 709-165(1), it did so only as the head company of the Austral Holdings consolidated group and did not at that time become a former exempting entity for any other purposes because until 9 July 2003 it had never ceased to be an exempting entity . As a result, when it ceased to be exempting entity on 6 February 2004 after having become an exempting entity for the first time on 9 July 2003, ss 208-50(2) precluded it from becoming a former exempting entity : see [2008] FCA 444 at [27] . 21 In short, the Appellants submitted to the primary judge that:

As the learned primary judge observed ([2008] FCA 444 at [2]- [4]), this appeal is concerned with the interaction between two complex parts of the tax legislation: the imputation system now found in Pt 3 - 6 of the ITAA97 and the consolidation regime contained in Pt 3 - 90 of the ITAA97. Until the decision of the learned primary judge, no court had considered the operation of the imputation system since its initial enactment in Pt IIIA of the ITAA36, no court had relevantly considered the operation of the consolidation regime and no court had considered the interaction of these two Parts of the ITAA97.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1503">4 It is surprising that it has not come to the surface as a justiciable issue before now, however, as I have previously observed in Hastie Group Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 444 ; 2008 ATC 20-019 at [2] , for some unknown reason, so many of the more controversial or topical issues which have arisen in practice in recent times seem to carry the baggage of a significant time-lag before they are agitated in this Court. The more so in this case, because the Ruling was preceded by a number of writings by commentators with undoubted qualifications taking different views on the issue: see those referred to in footnotes 2 --- 9 inclusive in Treaty Application to a Capital Gains Tax after Conclusion of the Treaty , by the Honourable Justice Gzell, (2002) 76 ALJ 309. </sentence>
