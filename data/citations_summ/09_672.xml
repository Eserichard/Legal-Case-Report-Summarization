<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 544">It is clear from its terms, particularly subs (3), that s 31A sets a lower standard for applications of this kind than that set by High Court decisions such as General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (N.S.W. ) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129 to 130 per Barwick CJ: see Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc (2006) 150 IR 471 ; [2006] FCA 458 at [6] per Heerey J, Lawrenson Light Metal Die Casting Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Cosmick Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 753 at [15] per Heerey J, Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 65 ATR 222 ; [2006] FCA 1688 at [26] per Mansfield J, Boston Commercial at [27] per Rares J; Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 923 at [4] and [5] per Gilmour J, Jefferson Ford at [124] per Gordon J and Vranic v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCA 672 at [21] per Greenwood J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1268">Section 31A empowers the Court to award summary judgment in relation to a proceeding if satisfied that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of prosecuting it. The basis of the respondent Secretary's resort to s 31A is the contention that the applicant has not identified any question of law such as would enliven the Court's jurisdiction under s 44 of the AAT Act. Given that an appeal lies "on a question of law" only --- and not on a question of fact or of mixed law and fact: see Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 at [11] - [17] --- the issues before me are whether such a question has been raised by Mr Kronen and whether his argument thereon is sufficiently strong to warrant the matter going to trial: Vranic v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCA 672. </sentence>
