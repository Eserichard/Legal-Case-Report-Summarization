<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 98">He said nothing about the situation in which there was such a judgment in combination with other relief, much less about the situation that faces us here, namely, where damages, declarations and injunctions were sought, but where the only final relief awarded to the appellant is by way of a money judgment. That r 36A does have application in cases of this kind was at least implicit in the reasons of the trial Judge in the case reported on appeal as O'Kelly Holdings Pty Ltd v Dalrymple (1993) 45 FCR 145 , 154 and in the refusal of the majority (Sweeney and O'Connor JJ) to interfere with the trial Judge's discretion in relevant respects (see 45 FCR at 157). That proposition was affirmatively held by Moore J in Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Pashalidis [2000] FCA 1815 , and has been held, or assumed, by single Judges of the court since: see eg Sony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Stirling [2001] FCA 1852 ; Reidy's Lures Pty Ltd v Basser Millyard Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1242 ; Australasian Performing Right Association Limited v Metro On George Pty Limited [2004] FCA 1371 ; Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2006] FCA 487 ; and Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 34 ; (2006) 227 ALR 287. In the circumstances, we propose to proceed on the basis that r 36A does apply here. We do so because the submission made on behalf of the appellant is directly contradicted by Pashalidis , an authority not referred to by counsel, which has generally set the pattern of subsequent single-Judge decisions on the point.</sentence>
