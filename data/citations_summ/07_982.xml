<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 440">1 On 1 November 2007 the applicants filed an application alleging against the respondents breaches of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The application had been preceded by pre-action discovery orders: see Keshi Pty Ltd v Firefly Press (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 982. The subject matter of the dispute is most conveniently taken from the opening paragraphs of that decision:
 
 
 1. There are forty-four individual speech sounds in the English language. The individual speech sounds are referred to as "phonemes". A phoneme may be represented by a letter, or one or more combinations of letters of the alphabet, which are referred to as "graphemes". For example, the words "moon", "screw" and "glue" contain a common phoneme represented by the combination of the letters "oo", "ew" and "ue".</sentence>
