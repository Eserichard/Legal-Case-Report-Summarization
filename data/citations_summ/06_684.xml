<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 35">17 On 1 June 2006 further orders were made including an order that Mr Carey attend before a Registrar of the Court on a date to be fixed by the Registrar and thereafter as directed by the Registrar from time to time for examination on oath by ASIC and the receivers on matters relevant to: 
 
 (i) the information required to be produced by Mr Carey pursuant to the orders made in relation to him on 20 April 2006; 
 (ii) the affidavits he swore on 4 and 22 May 2006. 


Mr Carey was required to produce such books, documents, records or other papers which he might be directed by the Registrar from time to time to produce in aid of such examination. In making that order I said: 
 
 
 'In my opinion there is a real possibility that the disclosure affidavits sworn by Mr Carey have failed to disclose the full extent of assets and property owned or controlled by him or in relation to which he has an interest. The term "control" used in Order 4 is to be interpreted according to its ordinary meaning and not limited to property in which he has a legal or beneficial interest. '
