<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] NSWSC 1357">8 There are recent cases which have considered the somewhat similar situation where a witness, in his or her affidavit, adopts what he or she earlier said in a record of interview or similar document. Despite the general rule that a witness "ordinarily cannot give oral evidence by reference to the contents of a document" ( AWA Ltd v Radio 3XY Pty Ltd , unreported, NSWSC, 21 June 1991, McLelland J) , the general approach in those recent cases is that the witness's evidence may be given in the way I have outlined, but that the procedure gives rise to a need to exercise caution, particularly where some time has elapsed between preparation of the earlier record and the swearing of the adopting affidavit. The particular cases I have in mind are Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 833 and Temple v Powell [2007] FCA 987. </sentence>
