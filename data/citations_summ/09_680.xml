<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 283">I have borne in mind the care required in making findings in a matter such as this. As Mansfield J stated in Poniatowska v Hickinbotham [2009] FCA 680 at [47] : The reliability of witnesses is always difficult to assess. Each witness sees events from his or her own perspective. Over time there is sometimes a degree of rationalisation to fit objective material (documents) as it emerges into the understanding of events. Some witnesses' memories become refined by a strong belief in the rightness of their role, so that objectivity is lost to a degree. Ms Noble

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1043">The appeal and cross-appeal were from orders made by a single judge (Mansfield J) of this Court. Relevantly for present purposes, and leaving aside orders for costs, Mansfield J made an order that the applicant pay to the respondent by way of compensation for unlawful discrimination contrary to s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) ("the HREOC Act") the sum of $466,000, which sum includes interest. Among other findings, Mansfield J found that by reason of the conduct engaged in by the applicant leading to the termination of the respondent's employment, the applicant engaged in sex discrimination contrary to s 14(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) ("the SD Act") and unlawful discrimination contrary to s 46PO of the HREOC Act ( Poniatowska v Hickinbotham [2009] FCA 680). </sentence>

At [36] his Honour noted that s 94 conduct was also conduct that could amount to unlawful discrimination but that the applicant did not rely on s 94 and it was not therefore necessary to say anything more about it. In the circumstance (as I foreshadowed earlier) I think the matter should go to trial. Subparagraph 75(b) should become a new paragraph. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] VCAT 802">Counsel for the Complainant submitted that if I were to find that the policies were nonexistent, or that staff were prevented or dissuaded from relying on these policies, then this behaviour could be used to found an inference as to the mindset of the company towards the Complainant. In so doing she relied on a similar pattern of reasoning employed in Poniatowska v Hickinbotham (2009) FCA 680 , a Federal Court case to which I will return when discussing her claim of victimization.  Counsel for the Complainant has referred me to the chain of reasoning exemplified in the cases of McKenna v State of Victoria and ors (1998) EOC 92-927 and Poniatowski v Hickinbotham (2009) FCA 680 (a case to which I have earlier referred) and suggested that inferences were available in the case before me to use in a similar fashion as had been utilised in those cases. </sentence>

It was in that state of mind that she embarked upon her offending behaviour. That contention was supported by a number of medical reports [2] and also by the fact that she made a successful claim for damages in the Federal Court of Australia for sexual harassment, as a result of which she was awarded a substantial amount of damages. I have carefully read that judgment, [3] which was tendered both to the Magistrate and on this appeal. </sentence>

 Introduction 
 This is an appeal against an award of damages to a former teacher for breach of his employment contract.  So far as we can ascertain, the only decisions in Australia which have doubted the implication of the term of mutual trust and confidence are in Heptonstall v Gaskin (No. 2) [50] (Hoeben J); McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Limited [51] (Buchanan J) and Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Limited [52] (Tracey J). In the circumstances of each of those cases, it was not necessary for the Court to express a concluded view. [53] </sentence>
