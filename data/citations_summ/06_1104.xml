<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1121">

9 There is in my view a very real question as to whether the Tribunal correctly understood and correctly applied the principles stated in Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387 at [36] as it purported to do: see SBWC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1104. No consideration appears to have been given either to societal perceptions in India or to "legal, social, cultural and religious norms prevalent in [Indian] society": cf Applicant S at [50]. This, though, is not a matter I need explore for reasons I give below.</sentence>
