<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 61">27 The other decisions on which Ascot Four relied (cited at [30] of the Full Court's decision in Prouds Jewellers [2008] FCAFC 199 and at [15] above) do not lead to any conclusion contrary to that reached by the primary judge on the facts of the present case. None of the decisions tested the extent of the potential representation conveyed by dual pricing because none involved facts where the strike through price had been the ticketed or offer price. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Carrerabenz Diamond Industries Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1103 involved a plea of guilty in circumstances where it was admitted that the items had never been offered for sale at the strike through price. Nevertheless, the plea of guilty was to each allegation including that "each advertisement would have led [the consumer] to believe that if they purchased the diamond in question in each instance, that they would obtain a substantial saving, which amounted to the difference between those two prices" (at [6]). Trade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd and Cue &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1996) 85 A Crim R 500 also involved guilty pleas in circumstances where the items had never been offered for sale at the higher price. Again, the same situation (that is, no previous offer for sale at the higher price) existed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) v Terania Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 732. Ducret v Chaudhary's Oriental Carpet Palace Pty Ltd (1987) 16 FCR 562 also did not call for determination of the question whether the representation extended beyond a mere offer, albeit for different reasons. 15 Ascot Four thus argued that the primary judge should have treated the strike through price as the offer price in the period before the sale and tested the alleged falsity of the representation against that meaning. According to Ascot Four this approach would have been consistent with what the Full Court said in Prouds Jewellers [2008] FCAFC 199 at [30] :
 According to Counsel for Prouds, the preponderance of authority on dual pricing in this context favours the view that the statement of the higher of the two prices embodies a representation that the goods have previously been offered for sale at that price. Reference was made to ACCC v Carrerabenz Diamond Industries Pty Ltd (supra), Trade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd (supra), ACCC v Terania Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 732 and Ducret v Chaudhary's Oriental Carpet Palace Pty Ltd (1987) 16 FCR 562. </sentence>

It was also submitted on behalf of Prouds that the Ascot Four case is distinguishable from the present or, if not distinguishable, has been wrongly decided and is the subject of a pending appeal.
