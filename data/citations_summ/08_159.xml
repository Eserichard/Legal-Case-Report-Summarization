Prior to tax periods starting on or after 1 July 2008 section 105-65 did not apply to a GST refund where the overpaid amount was for a transaction that did not give rise to a 'supply' as defined in section 9-10 of the GST Act. This was decided by the Federal Court in Kap Motors Pty Ltd v. Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 159 ; 2008 ATC 20-007 ; (2008) 68 ATR 927 ( Kap Motors). 13. Section 105-65 was amended to overcome this identified deficiency in the law and to cover overpaid amounts involving an arrangement that was treated as giving rise to a taxable supply but which does not give rise to a supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 22">Such a process of reiterating prices, values and GST payable has no place in a taxpayer's compliance with GST as a "practical business tax". 59. We also note the comment of Emmett J in KAP Motors Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 159 ; (2008) 168 FCR 319 at [33] :
 
 
 Section 105-65 should not be given an expansive construction. While its object may be commendable, in seeking to avoid windfall gains for taxpayers, it is, in a sense, a paternalistic interference with the rights of taxpayers. It proceeds on the basis that GST that should not have been paid has been paid by a taxpayer.</sentence>
