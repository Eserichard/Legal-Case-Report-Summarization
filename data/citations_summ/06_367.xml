<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 132">The award of the Diploma in Business in March 2007 does not assist Mr Kabir. That is because it is not conferral but successful completion of a substantial part of the course that cl.5A504(1)(d)(iii) of the Migration Regulations is directed toward. Successful completion of the course is a necessary precondition to conferral of a Diploma or Degree, but the course itself is successfully completed prior to the date of conferral. [60] Therefore, conferral of the Diploma in March 2007 does not bring him within the scope of successful completion of a substantial part of the Diploma course within two years of the date of his Student Visa application on 14 March 2008. </sentence>
