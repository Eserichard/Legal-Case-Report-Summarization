<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1028">Mr Rinka's application came before Lindgren J on 19 June 2009 and 10 July 2009, at which time Mr Rinka was represented by counsel. His Honour received extensive argument on the question of whether he should extend the time pursuant to s 477A(2). His Honour looked at, and considered, Mr Rinka's arguments relating to the hardship which his removal from Australia would bring upon his children. Ultimately, Lindgren J concluded that it was not appropriate to extend the time: see Rinka v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 886. It followed, once he had concluded that time should not be extended, that the application was incompetent, and his Honour inevitably dismissed the application. </sentence>
