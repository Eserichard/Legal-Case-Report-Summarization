<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1375">40 As Gilmour J said in Barrett at [23]-[24]:
 The general rule under Order 62 rule 3(3) may be departed from where the party in whose favour the costs order was made was required by the interlocutory proceeding to 'incur significant costs over and above those which it would have incurred had the opposing party acted with competence and diligence': Life Airbag Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Co (New Zealand) Ltd [1998] FCA 545 ; where the proceeding is complex and its final resolution is a long time away: Allstate Life Insurance Co v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [1995] FCA 660 ; Readymix Holdings International Pty Ltd v Wieland Process Equipment Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1297: Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (No 3) [2004] FCA 347. In McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 , Weinberg J adopted the observation of Lindgren J in Allstate that: 
 
 ... the power to order that costs be paid forthwith should perhaps be used less sparingly than it has in the past. This is particularly so in lengthy and complex cases where substantial costs have been thrown away as a result of ill-considered pleadings being drawn. Such costs should be capable of being recovered without the innocent party having to wait, possibly for years, for that to occur. 
 

In Barrett , Gilmour J referred to a number of cases in which the unsuccessful respondents in intellectual property cases were ordered to pay costs forthwith: see Barrett at [26]-[28]. As his Honour noted, however, each case depends very much on its own circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 373">1 These proceedings were first commenced by way of an Application and Statement of Claim filed on 15 March 2004. The proceedings had been listed for hearing before Conti J on 4 September 2006 but that hearing was vacated. The history of the proceedings up to that date have been recounted by his Honour ( Readymix Holdings International Pte Ltd v Wieland Process Equipment Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1297) and need not be now repeated.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1823">23 The general rule under Order 62 rule 3(3) may be departed from where the party in whose favour the costs order was made was required by the interlocutory proceeding to "incur significant costs over and above those which it would have incurred had the opposing party acted with competence and diligence": Life Airbag Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Co (New Zealand) Ltd [1998] FCA 545 ; where the proceeding is complex and its final resolution is a long time away: Allstate Life Insurance Co v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [1995] FCA 660 ; Readymix Holdings International Pte Ltd v Wieland Process Equipment Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1297: Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (No 3) [2004] FCA 347. </sentence>
