<sentence id="cs31" from="[2011] FMCA 18">c) The Tribunal applied the wrong statutory test, giving rise to jurisdictional error. 4. The MRT failed to make obvious inquiries about critical facts the existence of which was easily ascertained, giving rise to jurisdictional error: see MIAC v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 ; (2009) 259 ALR 429 at [25] ; Khant v MIAC [2009] FCA 1247. There were two such obvious inquiries as follows: a) Prior to making a decision, the MRT should have contacted the head chef Arifur Rahman and asked him whether the content of the two documents he signed was correct, and the basis on which he believed the content was correct. Mr Rahman's answers were of central importance to the MRT's determination as to whether or not "evidence has become available that the information given or used as part of the assessment of the applicant's skills is false or misleading in a material particular". The applicant also submitted that following the commencement of the hearing in the Tribunal which he did not attend, but prior to making a decision, the Tribunal should have contacted him or his migration agent to confirm that he did not wish to attend the hearing. He submitted that, through his migration agent, he had responded to previous communications from the Tribunal and that this was a factor in support of a conclusion that the Tribunal should have made an inquiry to confirm that he did not wish to attend the hearing. He submitted that it would have been easy for the Tribunal to make this inquiry. In this regard, he referred to Khant v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 1247 ; (2009) 112 ALD 241. In that case the Tribunal did not hold a hearing because the applicant had failed to respond to a request to provide information and to comment on certain other information. Amongst other things the Tribunal had invited the applicant to provide evidence that his non-compliance with a visa condition was due to exceptional circumstances beyond his control. Cowdroy J held that the Tribunal could have emailed or telephoned Mr Khant to find out with certainty whether or not there was evidence of exceptional circumstances which excused his failure to comply with a condition of his visa. His Honour held that this was a critical fact in relation to which the Tribunal could and should have made an enquiry and that, in the circumstances, its failure to make that enquiry amounted to a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs117" from="[2010] FCA 767">The appeal to this Court was listed in the ordinary course to be heard by a single judge on 27 May 2010. By letter dated 12 May 2010, the Minister's solicitors requested that the appeal be heard by a Full Court. The letter said that the consideration of the appeal could involve a consideration of what was said in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 (2009) 259 ALR 429 at [25] , per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ. The letter suggested that single judges of this Court who have considered that passage "have varied in its consideration. " Reference was made to Brown v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 1098 , SZLGP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 1470 and Khant v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 1247 as examples. A copy of the letter from the Minister's solicitors was sent to the first and second respondents both by email and post. The postal addresses (one a post office box number and the other a street address) were in Mildura. In response to that letter, my associate advised the Minister's solicitors that I was disinclined to decide whether the appeal should be heard by a Full Court without first giving the first and second respondents an opportunity to be heard on that question. The letter invited the Minister to renew the application for the appeal to be heard by a Full Court when it was called on for hearing on 27 May 2010. </sentence>

Similarly I reject the Applicant's submission that the Tribunal felt that it had no power to invite the Applicant to appear before it, as was the case in Khant v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1247. A fair reading of the Tribunal's decision in the case before this Court does not suggest for a moment that the Tribunal was under any mistake as to its entitlements to exercise its discretion in favour of the Applicant to give her further time.
