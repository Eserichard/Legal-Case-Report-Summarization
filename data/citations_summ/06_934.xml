<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 735">21 The Respondent Minister in the present appeal accepted that the Federal Magistrate was under an obligation to provide reasons for his decision. It is thus an error of law for a Federal Magistrate to fail to give reasons for dismissing an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal: SZDCJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1500 at [16] per Jacobson J. Albeit in a different statutory context, it has also been recognised that a Federal Magistrate should give sufficient reasons for reaching a conclusion that an application should be summarily dismissed: Penhall-Jones v State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 934 at [25] . Tamberlin J there said that the reasons:
 ... do not have to be elaborate or excessively detailed, but the touchstone is that the reasons must indicate to the parties why the decision was made in order to allow them to exercise such rights as may be available in respect of that decision ... </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 1141">Further in Penhall-Jones v State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 934 , the Federal Court cautioned against an assessment on a summary dismissal application of evidence that would be presented on a trial of a claim but also cautioned that, in dealing with summary dismissal, the Court must give sufficient reasons for the dismissal so that the dismissal is properly understood by the parties.</sentence>
