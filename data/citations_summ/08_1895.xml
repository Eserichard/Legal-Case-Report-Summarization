9 The availability of these provisions as a basis for the equivalent, in general terms, of a s 479(3) direction has been confirmed in a number of cases. Among the more recent are Meadow Springs Fairway Resort Ltd v Balanced Securities Ltd [2007] FCA 143 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1433 , Ex parte McGrath; Re Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd [2008] FCA 563 ; (2008) 26 ACLC 386 , Hall re Australian Capital Reserve Ltd [2008] FCA 1895 and Francis v Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd [2009] FCA 1212. As Young J pointed out in Dean-Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hyrdoponics Pty Ltd (1997) 42 NSWLR 209 , the making of what amounts to a direction that the liquidator in a voluntary winding up is justified in taking a particular course is within s 511(1)(a) and s 511(2) if the circumstances of the particular winding up raise a question as to the propriety or desirability of pursuing that course.</sentence>
