<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 442">Colliers submits there has been debate in the Court concerning the effect of s 51A of the Act and upon the question whether the onus of showing that there were reasonable grounds for representation concerning future matters remains with the representor or whether, if evidence is produced to the contrary, the deeming provision in s 51A of the TPA does not operate: see Skiwing Pty Ltd t/as Cafe Tiffany's v Trust Co of Australia Ltd (Stockland Property Management Ltd) [2009] FCA 347 ; (2009) 255 ALR 339 ; McGrath and Another v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 2 ; [2008] FCAFC 2 ; (2008) 165 FCR 230 at [162] - [194]. With regard to the latter authority, Colliers submits that the observations of Allsop J (at [192]) suggest that s 51A of the TPA raised only an initial onus requiring the provision of some evidence that there were reasonable grounds for making a representation and that Emmett J at [44] expressed a similar opinion. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 438">The present proceedings arise from claims by Skiwing that Stockland, by its conduct in making a number of representations (which can be categorised into three groups) upon which Skiwing relied to its detriment, engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TP Act "). Skiwing sought damages under s 82 of the TP Act . I described the three groups of representations in an earlier interlocutory judgment ( Skiwing Pty Limited trading as Caf&eacute; Tiffany's v Trust Company of Australia Ltd (Stockland Property Management Ltd) [2009] FCA 347) in the following way (at [6]---[9]): </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1429">That which may also be presently left to one side is whether each of the representations which the Applicant presently maintains are representations in respect " to any future matter " truly falls within that description. Of present relevance is the importance assumed by s 51A in casting the " burden of proof " upon the Respondents. Different views have also been expressed as to the manner of operation of s 51A and the nature of the evidence to be adduced by a respondent before the " deeming " effect of s 51A ceases to operate: McGrath v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 2 , 165 FCR 230 ; Skiwing Pty Ltd t/as Caf&eacute; Tiffany's v Trust Co of Australia Ltd (Stockland Property Management Ltd) [2009] FCA 347 at [21] to [24] [2009] FCA 347 ; [2009] FCA 347 ; , 255 ALR 339 at 343 to 344 per Buchanan J.
