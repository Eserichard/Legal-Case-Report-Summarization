<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 42">130 While a court or tribunal operating under flexible procedural provisions must observe the rules of natural justice, this does not mean that those rules can be used to admit the rules of evidence through a side door or, as Brennan J put it in Re Pochi v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, [46] to allow the rules of evidence to 'creep back in through a domestic procedural rule'. It is well-established that the rules of evidence 'form no part of the rules of natural justice'. [47] Certainly the rules of evidence may be valuable and should not be lightly discarded, particularly where there is a serious dispute over a matter which may be of importance to the outcome of the proceeding. [48] But courts or tribunals operating under such provisions are not required to apply court-like rules or to act on evidence alone. [49] The provisions are intended to be 'facultative, not restrictive' [50] and are intended to free a court or tribunal 'from constraints otherwise applicable to courts of law and regarded as in appropriate'.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 177">2 The substance of the challenge by Mr Heyward before the primary judge to the decision of the AAT was that the AAT failed to comply with the rules of procedural fairness and to give him a reasonable opportunity to present his case. The primary judge traced the procedural course of the hearing before the AAT in considerable detail. It is unnecessary to repeat all those matters. They may be found, by the interested reader, in the published judgment ( Heyward v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1313). A short summary will suffice for present purposes.</sentence>
