<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1018">During the course of the trial, the issues raised by the pleadings were not the issues pressed by the parties and, in particular, did not reflect the case as finally advanced by the applicants. However, the respondent consented to this departure from the pleadings. Generally, it is preferable that particulars be amended, "particularly is this so when the action finally determines the rights of the parties in the cause of action", as in the instant case: Leotta v Public Transport Commission (NSW) (1976) 9 ALR 437 at 446 per Stephen, Mason, Jacobs JJ; Australian Medic-Care Co Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd (No 5 ) [2008] FCA 1979 at [15] per Finn J. However, judgment can be given on the facts as they have emerged during the trial, despite a failure to amend pleadings, where the new issue or new way of particularising the existing issue emerges at the trial and is litigated: Water Board v Moustakas [1988] HCA 12 ; (1988) 180 CLR 491 at 497 per Mason CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ; Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70 ; (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664 per Murphy, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ; North East Equity Pty Ltd v Proud Nominees Pty Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 1430 at [4] per Rares J . </sentence>
