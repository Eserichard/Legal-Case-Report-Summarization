<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1150">In Wright Rubber Products Pty Ltd v Bayer AG [2008] FCA 1510 ; [2008] ATPR 42-258 , Tracey J (at [5]) said: The principles governing the exercise of the Court's power summarily to dismiss a claim on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action, the principles which govern pleadings in this Court and the relevant authorities are conveniently summarised by Weinberg J in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1101 ; (1999) 165 ALR 409 at 415-421. It is not necessary to restate, at length, his Honour's exposition of the relevant rules and the statements of principle which emerge from the cases to which he refers. It is sufficient, for present purposes, to note that:
 The power to dismiss a claim because it discloses no reasonable cause of action will not lightly be exercised: see Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91; General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 128-130; Webster v Lampard [1993] HCA 57 ; (1993) 177 CLR 598 at 602-603.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 361">If the description incorporates a reference to conduct alleged in the pleadings, a person or his or her adviser ought to be able, by reading the description and the relevant portion of the pleadings, to determine whether he or she is a member of the represented group. If a person cannot reasonably be expected to do this, the definition is unlikely to satisfy the requirements of s 33H(1)(a). 
 

 
In applying these principles in Wright Rubber Products Pty Ltd v Bayer AG [2008] FCA 1510 at [13] Tracey J referred to the " need for precision in the framing of group definitions in representative proceedings ". In Johnstone v HIH Ltd [2004] FCA 190 at [52] Tamberlin J likewise said that " it is necessary to know with some precision who the group members are ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1317">The respondents successfully moved the Court for orders striking out the original statement of claim: see Wright Rubber Products Pty Ltd v Bayer AG [2008] FCA 1510 ("my earlier reasons"). The shortcomings of this original pleading fell into two broad categories: first, that the applicant had failed to identify with sufficient precision the group members whom it wished to represent, and secondly, that the applicant had failed to plead sufficient material facts to establish a cause of action. More particularly, I identified the following deficiencies in the original statement of claim: Group definition
 Potential group members would have had difficulty ascertaining whether they were members of the group because of the difficulty in determining whether they had bought "Rubber Products"; The definition of "Rubber Products" was inadequate, which in turn affected the entire statement of claim; and The applicant had not pleaded sufficient material facts to establish that it was a member of the group it sought to represent. The Cartel Arrangements
 The discrete causes of action arising under sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of s 45(2)(a) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TPA") had not been pleaded separately. Identification of the Markets
 The pleading confused references to the global and Australian markets, referring to the global market at times and the Australian market at other times without explaining why; The pleading did not clearly establish the existence of an Australian, as distinct from a global, market; and There were inconsistencies as to whether the market was for "Rubber Chemicals" or "Rubber Products". Giving effect to the arrangements in Australia
 The discrete causes of action under s 45(2)(b) (i) and (ii) of the Act, as referred to in paragraphs 18 to 25 of the statement of claim, were (like those relating to the cartel arrangements) "rolled up" and not pleaded separately; No material facts were pleaded as to how the Australian respondents acted "at the direction" or with the "consent or agreement" of the foreign respondents; No material facts were pleaded to explain how it was said that the Australian respondents acted as the agents of the foreign respondents; and In attempting to establish a contravention of s 75B of the Act, the applicant did not plead any intentional and knowing participation by a respondent in any alleged contravention of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1203">If the description incorporates a reference to conduct alleged in the pleadings, a person or his or her adviser ought to be able, by reading the description and the relevant portion of the pleadings, to determine whether he or she is a member of the represented group. If a person cannot reasonably be expected to do this, the definition is unlikely to satisfy the requirements of s 33H(1)(a).
