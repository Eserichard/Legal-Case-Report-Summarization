<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 58">In addition to the matters specified in subs (a)-(d) of s 481(3), matters relevant to determining the pecuniary penalty include: the need to deter contravention of the EPBC Act by the party concerned and by the public in general: Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd [1991] ATPR 41-076 at 52,152 and Minister for Environment Heritage and the Arts v Lamattina [2009] FCA 753 at [47] ; the extent to which the contravener has co-operated during investigations and subsequent proceedings; Minister for Environment and Heritage v Warne [2007] FCA 599: see however Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No 3) [2004] FCA 1317 at [73] where Sackville J expressed reservation on this point; whether the contravener has taken remedial action to minimise environmental damage: Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No 3) [2004] FCA 1317 at [58] ; whether the contravener has any history of other contravening behaviour; Minister for Environment and Heritage v Warne [2007] FCA 599 at [15]- [16]; Minister for Environment Heritage and the Arts v Lamattina [2009] FCA 753 at [27] - [29] and [74]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWLEC 137">9 Most importantly, the sentence of the court needs to operate as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar offences by persons who might be tempted to do so by the prospect that, if they are caught, only light punishment will be imposed: R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 at 597. The purpose of general deterrence is particularly relevant when imposing a sentence for offences of clearing of native vegetation contrary to law: see Cameron v Eurobodalla Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 47 ; (2006) 146 LGERA 349 at [59] , [71]-[80]; Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 242 ; (2006) 145 LGERA 189 at [103] - [106]; Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Taylor [2007] NSWLEC 530 at [31] - [33] ; Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Wilton [2008] NSWLEC 297 at [77] ; Climate Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Hudson [2009] NSWLEC 4 ; (2009) 165 LGERA 256 at [81] - [88]; and Pittwater Council v Scahill [2009] NSWLEC 12 ; (2009) 165 LGERA 289 at [45] ; Lamattina &amp; Anor v Gould [2009] SASC 130 (15 May 2009) at [73] and Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts v Lamattina [2009] FCA 753 (17 July 2009) at [47]. 89 Finally, although concerning different statutory provisions in another jurisdiction, I also note the penalties imposed for clearing native vegetation in breach of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) in Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No. 3) [2004] FCA 1317 ; (2004) 136 LGERA 89 and Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts v Lamattina [2009] FCA 753.  12 On land used or proposed to be used for purposes of agriculture, clearing of native vegetation might be intended to increase the grazing productivity (such as increasing pasture and stocking rate), change from a financially lower yielding to a financially higher yielding agricultural use (such as from grazing to cropping) or facilitate more practical and cost effective operations, including of machinery and equipment, also with the expectation of an increase in the capital value of the land. Sentencing courts have repeatedly noted that offenders have cleared native vegetation for commercial gain: see, as examples, Piva v Brinkworth (1992) 59 SASR 92 at 96; Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No. 3) [2004] FCA 1317 ; (2004) 136 LGERA 89 at [65] and see also [47], [48], [59] and [61]; Director-General Department of Environment and Climate Change v Wilton [2008] NSWLEC 297 at [51] , [76]; Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Hudson [2009] NSWLEC 4 ; (2009) 165 LGERA 256 at [78] ; Lamattina &amp; Anor v Gould [2009] SASC 130 at [3] , [17] and [19]; Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts v Lamattina [2009] FCA 753 at [39] and [68].</sentence>
