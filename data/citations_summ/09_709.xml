<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1153">A claim based on mere speculation is an insufficient basis for a conclusion that there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has a right to obtain relief. Examples of speculative claims for pre-trial discovery that have failed in the Federal Court include: 
(a) CTC Productions Pty Ltd v Royal NSW Canine Council Ltd [1999] FCA 1866 (Hill J);
 
(b) Strang Aniokaka Ltd v Lihir Gold Ltd (No 2) [2010] FCA 1065 (Rares J);
 
(c) Cape Australia Holdings Pty Ltd v Iannello [2009] FCA 709 (Siopis J); and
 
(d) Cape Australia Holdings Pty Ld v Modern Industries Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 976 (Siopis J).
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 976">In the case of Cape Australia Holdings Pty Ltd v Iannello [2009] FCA 709 ( Iannello ), I referred to the observations of Gleeson CJ (as he then was) in dissent in the case of Wright v Gasweld Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 317 ( Wright ) in relation to the tension between two policy considerations, namely, permitting a former employee to compete against his former employer, on the one hand, and the protection of the confidential information of the former employer, on the other. At 329, Gleeson CJ observed: 
 ...a case such as the present involves a tension between two competing considerations of public policy. An employer is not entitled to protect himself against mere competition by a former employee, and the corollary of that is that the employee is entitled to use skill, experience and know-how acquired in the service of the former employer in legitimate competition. It is in the public interest that this should be so: Stenhouse Australia Ltd v Phillips [1973] UKPC 1 ; [1974] AC 391 at 400. At the same time the law will protect trade secrets and confidential information, and will intervene to prevent their misuse. The decision of the Court of Appeal in England in Faccenda Chicken Ltd v Fowler [1987] Ch 117 illustrates the importance, when there is a conflict between these two principles, of a close examination and accurate categorisation of the nature of the alleged trade secret or confidential information. 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] QSC 191">That rule has been discussed in a more recent decision by Siopis J, in the Federal Court, in Cape Australia Holdings Pty Ltd -v- Iannello [2009] FCA 709 , where his Honour said at paragraph 57, 
 
 
 "... that it is incumbent on an applicant for preliminary discovery to adduce evidence that he or she requires the relief available under O 15A to commence, or to determine whether to commence, a proceeding in this court based on a cause of action which invokes the original jurisdiction of the court, or at least, that a proceeding based on such a cause of action will be commenced, and that the O 15A relief is sought in respect of other causes of action or potential causes of action, comprising part of the same matter.</sentence>
