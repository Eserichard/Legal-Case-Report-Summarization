The applicant also placed reliance on the views expressed by Rares J in SZEJF v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 724 which was a case involving the Tribunal's finding of implausibility in relation to certain newspaper articles. At [59] his Honour said: "I am of opinion that by the way in which it dismissed the objective evidence provided in the two newspaper articles, the tribunal ignored relevant material (the newspaper articles) and relied on irrelevant material (namely its bare, unsupported assertions that the objective facts demonstrated in the newspaper articles were 'somewhat implausible' and gave 'no evidence' of the Jirga's activities). That was a jurisdictional error: see Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179; Secretary of State for Education and Science v Thameside Metropolitan Borough Council [1976] UKHL 6 ; [1977] AC 1014 at 1047D-E; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222 at 233 [27] , 241 [58], 250 [97] and SZGDB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 431 at [33] - [38] . Here, procedural fairness required the tribunal to give proper genuine and real consideration to the appellant's claim that he had been persecuted by the tribal leaders and the Jirga who had been in Khyber Agency. The tribunal had noted country information on jirgas in Pakistan earlier in its decision immediately before the section headed 'Findings and Reasons'.</sentence>

 25. The complaint therefore was that there was jurisdictional error given the evidence set out above, and that there was no evidence to suggest otherwise, the Tribunal had made a finding based on "no evidence". This with reference to SZGBD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affair [2006] FCA 431 at [42] was said to amount to jurisdictional error. This complaint is not made out.
