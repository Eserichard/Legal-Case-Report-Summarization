<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] APO 13">In Les Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Pty Ltd [2008] APO 11 the delegate noted that a change had been made to section 31A since General Steel (supra) and Stack (supra) which meant that:
 
"the principles set out in General Steel (supra) are not given "canonical force" in summary dismissal proceedings ( Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 425 at 427). Rather, a proceeding may be dismissed where a party has "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding" (see for example Garrett v Macks [2006] FCA 601 , White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 , Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 , Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 , Vans, Inc. v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 , E . &amp; J. Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 136 , and Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227). "
 
 
As noted in the Servier decision, a similar approach is also applied in England and Queensland. It seems clear that Parliament has decided that the approach to summary judgment in all federal courts should be the same, and that the same approach applies to all matters (not just to migration cases). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1374">However, the assessment of whether there is a reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding must depend upon the evidence and pleading the subject of the application. In Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 at [26] - [29] (decided on 5 December 2006) Mansfield J appeared to support the more liberal approach taken by Wilcox J, although the case was essentially decided on the basis of Anshun estoppel [5] . Further support for the approach taken by Wilcox J can be found in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227 (decided on 15 September 2006) at [9]-[11] per Moore J and Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 (decided 28 April 2006) at [6] per Heerey J. Conversely, support for the approach taken by Rares J can be found in Australian Inernational Pilots Assn v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 441 at [23] (decided on 9 November 2006) per Tracey J. The authorities were reviewed by Jacobson J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 (decided 2 November 2006) at [30]-[33] where His Honour said: ...</sentence>
