 ANDERSON J. Mr Blue submits that in this regard I am bound to follow a decision of the Full Court of Western Australia in Boyes v Colins [2000] WASCA 344 ; (2000) 23 WAR 123. He also refers to Comcare v Foster [2006] FCA 6 ; (2006) 150 FCR 301 at [41] - [52] where Greenwood J followed Boyes v Colins and not J-Corp . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] QICmr 16"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1569">10 Having regard to the significance of legal professional privilege in our jurisprudence and particularly the observations of the High Court that legal professional privilege is a rule of substantive law available to a person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents which would reveal communications between a client and his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services, including representation in legal proceedings ( Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543 at 9, per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ), and having regard to the observations in the authorities that legal professional privilege is not merely a rule of evidence but an 'important common law immunity' not confined to simply processes of discovery and inspection (note the authorities collected in Comcare v Foster [2006] FCA 6 ; (2006) 226 ALR 749 [31] --- [37]), it seems to me that the substantive question between the parties is one which ought not to be resolved on a guillotine order in the circumstances as they present. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] AATA 533">Ms Fitzpatrick said such a document would almost certainly be the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege because it would have been prepared for the sole purpose of being used in these proceedings: see Esso Australia Resources; see also Comcare v Christina Foster [2006] FCA 6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] ACTAAT 14">9. Legal professional privilege is an exemption in the public interest, which is said to be founded in the principle that the promotion of justice can best be served by allowing a client to communicate fully and frankly with the client's legal adviser without fear of disclosure. It attaches to any communication, not merely a document. The accepted principles to be applied in determining whether a communication attracts legal professional privilege are set out in a recent Federal Court decision: Comcare v Christina Foster [2006] FCA 6. </sentence>
