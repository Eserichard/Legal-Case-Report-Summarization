<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 136">The principles relevant to the construction and application of this provision were not put in question in the present proceeding. Conduct, it may thus be noted, is " likely to mislead or deceive " if there is a " real or not remote chance or possibility regardless of whether it is less or more than fifty per cent ": Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 87 per Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ (applying Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union [1979] FCA 85 ; (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 346 per Deane J and Sheen v Fields Pty Ltd (1984) 58 ALJR 93). See also Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 7) [2008] FCA 1364 at [97] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 498">In Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 7) [2008] FCA 1364 , delivered 5 September 2008, the background facts to the proceedings are described in detail. In that judgment I ordered that the amended application filed by the applicants on 16 February 2006 be dismissed, and that the cross-claim filed by the first and second respondents on 5 June 2007 be allowed. Subsequently in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 8) [2008] FCA 1556 , delivered 17 October 2008, I ordered that, with the exception of a number of costs incurred by the applicants in relation to interlocutory applications, the applicants pay the costs of the first and second respondents, such costs to be taxed if not otherwise agreed. In so ordering I rejected the claim of the first and second respondents that their costs be paid by the applicants on an indemnity basis.  It is not in dispute that the orders of the Court of 5 September 2008 and 17 October 2008 have been entered. The applicants have claimed that the issue of jurisdiction arose because, following the entry of those orders, the jurisdiction of the Court has been spent in relation to costs in these proceedings. In summary, the applicants' argument is: Judgment was given in favour of the first and second respondents in the primary proceedings on 5 September 2008 ( Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 7) [2008] FCA 1364). This notice of motion was filed on 26 September 2008. On 17 October 2008 in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 8) [2008] FCA 1556 all outstanding costs issues were dealt with, and, subject to a number of reserved interlocutory costs, the first, second and third applicants were ordered to pay the costs of the first and second respondents. It became clear during the primary proceedings that, when considering the history of events culminating in the proceedings and all matters concerning the applicants, the second applicant played a pivotal role. All decisions, all discussions, and all negotiations were made, had and conducted by the second applicant on his own behalf and on behalf of the first and third applicants. The position is clouded by the assignment of causes of action, an issue to which I will return shortly, however prima facie the actual authority to make all decisions with respect to the conduct of litigation in the primary proceedings remained with the second applicant because of his historical role and his position as sole director and shareholder of the first applicant, and the sole director of the third applicant. Indeed as I found in the primary judgment, the second applicant was, at all material times, the directing mind and will of the first and third applicants ( Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 7) [2008] FCA 1364 at [9] ). In light of these findings, was the role of Mrs Tracy such that an award of costs with respect to these proceedings should be made against her? </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1480">84 Conduct is " likely to mislead or deceive " if there is a " real or not remote chance or possibility regardless of whether it is less or more than fifty per cent ": Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 87 per Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ (applying Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union [1979] FCA 85 ; (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 346 per Deane J; Sheen v Fields Pty Ltd (1984) 58 ALJR 93) ; Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 7) [2008] FCA 1364 at [97] . A corporation's state of mind is immaterial in making out a case of misleading or deceptive conduct. In Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88 the Full Court relevantly observed:
 If a corporation is alleged to have contravened s 52(1) by making a statement of past or present fact, the corporation's state of mind is immaterial unless the statement involved the state of the corporation's mind. Whether or not s 52(1) is contravened does not depend upon the corporation's intention or its belief concerning the accuracy of such statement, but upon whether the statement in fact contains or conveys a meaning which is false; that is to say whether the statement contains or conveys a misrepresentation. Most commonly, such a statement will contain or convey a false meaning if what is stated concerning the past or present fact is not accurate; but a statement which is literally true may contain or convey a meaning which is false.
