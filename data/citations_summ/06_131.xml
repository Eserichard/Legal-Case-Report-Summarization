<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 186">An appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court is an appeal by way of rehearing. In order to succeed the appellants must demonstrate that the orders under appeal are the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error: Draper v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2006] FCAFC 157 ; (2006) 156 FCR 53 at [14] - [15]; Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 ; Qun Xiong (Kenny) Yu v Todaytech Distribution Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 131 at [30] - [32]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1042">As St George submitted, it is necessary to begin with an appreciation of the nature of an appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate under s 24(1)(d) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In a case also involving an appeal from a sequestration order made by a Federal Magistrate, Qun Xiong (Kenny) Yu v Todaytech Distribution Pty Ltd (ACN 059 027 250) (2006) 4 ABC(N) 133; [2006] FCA 131 , Young J explained the nature of such an appeal in these terms at [30]-[32]: 
 
 [ 30 ] Like appeals to the Full Court from a single judge of this Court, an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court is an appeal by way of re-hearing: see Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1558 at [4] (" Abeyesinghe "); and Low v Commonwealth [2001] FCA 702 at [3] ; see also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 at 533 [75]; and Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 157 ; (2002) 55 IPR 354 at [50] ---[54]. 
 

 
 
 [ 31 ] The expression 'appeal by way of re-hearing' is used in contradistinction to the expressions 'appeal in a strict sense', and 'appeal by way of hearing de novo '. It is important to bear in mind what these expressions connote.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 470">23 The jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia in matters such as this is appellate. Some cognisable error needs to be identified in the decision appealed from. See Qun Xiong (Kenny) Yu v Todaytech Distribution Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 131 at [30] . </sentence>
