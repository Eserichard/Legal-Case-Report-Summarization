<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1482">The background to this judgment is set out in full in Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen [2009] FCA 778 and Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen (No 2) [2009] FCA 1383. In Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen (No 2) [2009] FCA 1383 I ordered that these proceedings be transferred to the Family Court of Australia. The only outstanding matter for decision at this stage relates to costs incurred in the following proceedings: An application by Mrs Jensen for a stay of the proceedings for abuse of process. Mrs Jensen was unsuccessful in respect of this application. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1383">The background to these proceedings is described in detail in Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen [2009] FCA 778.  However that part of the trustee's amended notice of motion seeking an order that paras 10a to 10i of the Defence filed by the respondent be struck out has remained unresolved. This is because: in Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen [2009] FCA 778 I made no orders as to the respondent's Defence on the basis that, in light of the amendments to the trustee's statement of claim, the respondent was entitled to have an opportunity to replead her Defence; and in the judgment I noted that, once the respondent had filed amendments to her Defence, the trustee would be given an opportunity to raise relevant objections ([2009] FCA 778 at [59]).  As I noted earlier in this judgment, "consideration" in the context of the bankruptcy legislation has its ordinary legal and commercial meaning ( Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 249). The fact that the movement of consideration is acknowledged in a financial agreement does not give the consideration validity it would not otherwise have. (c) Further, and in any event, as I have already found in Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen [2009] FCA 778 , the transfer of property pursuant to a financial agreement does not equate to a transfer of property pursuant to Court order, as was the case in Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217. The current legislative framework applicable to financial agreements contemplates that a trustee in bankruptcy may make application pursuant to both s 120 and s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act to set aside a transfer pursuant to a financial agreement executed by the parties. Similarly, it is open to the Court to review the nature of the consideration stated in a financial agreement. In Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen [2009] FCA 778 I dismissed the respondent's notice of motion seeking an order that the substantive proceedings be stayed as an abuse of process. At the same time I dealt in part with the trustee's amended notice of motion filed 31 March 2009, and ordered that the trustee have leave to amend his statement of claim.  In Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen [2009] FCA 778 the Court declined of its own motion to transfer these proceedings to the Family Court. In that decision I observed that no formal application for transfer had been made by the respondent and no opportunity provided to the trustee to answer such an application. The respondent has now specifically sought an order that these proceedings be transferred to the Family Court, and filed detailed submissions in support of her application.  1. First, Mr Griffin QC for the respondent submitted that if the trustee is successful in the substantive proceedings the respondent will make an application in the Family Court under s 79(1) of the Family Law Act seeking an order altering the interests of the trustee in the relevant property of Mr Jensen. As Besanko J observed in Macks v Edge [2006] FCA 1077 ; (2006) 156 FCR 302 at [42] , the Federal Court can hear and determine the trustee's claim, but it cannot hear and determine a spouse's claim under the Family Law Act should it become necessary to do so. Since judgment was delivered in Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen [2009] FCA 778 it has become clear that: there are other potential claims against the respondent by the trustee, including the s 139ZQ notice concerning the property the subject of the respondent's Cross-Claim; and the respondent has subsequently commenced proceedings in the Family Court seeking declarations in relation to the financial agreement. </sentence>
