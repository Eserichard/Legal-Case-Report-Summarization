<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 556">In Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 I identified a non-exhaustive range of considerations which are of potential relevance in determining a penalty for contraventions of civil penalty provisions of Chapters 5 and 6 of the BCII Act. These considerations were derived from a number of decisions of the Court under other legislation. They have been found to be relevant to the fixing of penalties under the BCII Act: see Stuart v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2010] FCAFC 65 ; (2010) 185 FCR 308 at 331-2 (per Besanko and Gordon JJ). These considerations are not, of course, to be applied rigidly regardless of the circumstances of a particular case. They may, however, provide helpful guidance. In the end, however, it is the responsibility of the Court "to fix a penalty which pays appropriate regard to the circumstances in which the contraventions have occurred and the need to sustain public confidence in the statutory regime which imposes the obligations": Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Williams [2009] FCAFC 171 ; (2009) 262 ALR 417 at [29] , citing with approval Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 at [91] (per Buchanan J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 579">A non-exhaustive list of factors potentially relevant to the imposition of a penalty under the WR Act includes: 
(a) the nature and extent of the conduct which led to the contraventions;
(b) the circumstances in which that conduct took place;
(c) the nature and extent of any loss or damage sustained as a result of the contraventions;
(d) whether there has been similar previous conduct by the respondent;
 
(e) whether the contraventions were properly distinct or arose out of the one course of conduct;
(f) the size of the business enterprise involved;
(g) whether or not the contraventions were deliberate;
(h) whether senior management was involved in the contraventions;
(i) whether the party committing the contraventions has exhibited contrition;
(j) whether the party committing the contraventions has taken corrective action;
 
(k) whether the party committing the contraventions has co-operated with the enforcement authorities;
 
(l) the need to ensure compliance with minimum standards by provision of an effective means for investigation and enforcement of employee entitlements; and
 
(m) the need for specific and general deterrence. (see Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 ; Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 (at [14]); Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61 (at [40]) and John Holland Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 2) (2010) 192 IR 431 (at [27]) and McDonald (at [15])). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] FMCA 263">All of the parties have pointed to a number of relevant factors of the sort identified by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080. As I said in Ikin v Crown Trading Group Pty Ltd [2009] FMCA 1187 at [3] : "Subject only to the caution expressed by Buchanan J in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Proprietary Limited v McAlary-Smith (2008) FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 at 91 to the effect that the matters identified by Tracey J should not be treated as a rigid catalogue of matters for attention, it is now accepted that Tracey Js approach is correct in the sense that it indicates a number of relevant considerations. I also note the observations of Gyles J in A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2008) FCA 466 at [6] where his Honour said: "There are no mandatory statutory criteria and it is wrong to regard factors seen as relevant by one court as statutory criteria.

"A number of authorities discuss the factors to be taken into account in fixing a penalty, many of them borrowing from related fields, including the criminal law. It is sufficient to refer to the recent case of Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 as an example. However, the discretion is at large. There are no mandatory statutory criteria and it is wrong to regard factors seen as relevant by one court as statutory criteria.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2011] FMCA 220">The principles applicable to the determination of penalties for breach of the civil penalty provisions of the WRA have been discussed in a number of cases. Mowbray FM conveniently summarised such principles in Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 (and see Kelly v Fitzpatrick (2007) 166 IR 14 ; [2007] FCA 1080 per Tracey J and Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) (1999) 94 IR 231 ; [1999] FCA 1714 per Branson J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2011] FMCA 261">Coming then to the factors relevant to penalty. The applicant, in its submission, helpfully identified the relevant sentencing principles which apply to cases under the Workplace Relations Act . In particular, counsel for the applicant referred to the observations made by courts in Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd trading as Pangaea Restaurant and Bar [7] ; Kelly v Fitzpatrick [8] ; Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [9] ; and Blandy v Coverdale NT Pty Ltd [10] , which cases have outlined in some detail the relevant principles. In my view they are not controversial. The starting point is to look to the relevant objects set out in s.3 of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2011] FMCA 191">Despite that matter, issues of financial health while relevant, are not necessarily determinative. For instance, as Tracey J said in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2] at [28]: "No less than large corporate employers or small businesses have an obligation to meet minimum employment standards and they rightly have an expectation that this will occur. When it does not it will normally be necessary to mark the failure by imposing an appropriate monetary sanction. Such a sanction must be imposed at a meaningful level. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2011] FMCA 170">Next is the size of the business. In this regard, in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 Tracey J at [28] observed that: "No less than large corporate employers, small businesses have an obligation to meet minimum employment standards and their employees, rightly, have an expectation that this will occur. When it does not it will, normally, be necessary to mark the failure by imposing an appropriate monetary sanction. Such a sanction must be imposed at a meaningful level. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2010] FMCA 981">No excuse or explanation for the failure of a substantial employer to keep these vital employment records is shown in the evidence. His disregard of legal recording obligations when supervising the work of his payroll clerk reveals a high degree of culpability in relation to each of the contraventions xiv, xv, xvi, xvii, xviii, and xx in the above list. Sentencing considerations 
 Counsel for the Fair Work Ombudsman framed his submissions on penalty by reference to headings taken from the well-known list of sentencing considerations suggested in this area by Mowbray FM in Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 , and summarised by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at [14] . The list of considerations can guide, but is not a substitute for "the unrestrained statutory discretion" (cf. Gyles J in Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 at [11] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2010] FMCA 973">It should be noted that this list is not in any sense a checklist or a formula to be followed (see Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8). I also bear in mind the observations of Giles J in A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Limited v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466 at [6], where his Honour said: "A number of authorities discuss the factors to be taken into account in fixing a penalty, many of them borrowing from related fields, including the criminal law.

<sentence id="cs14" from="[2010] FCAFC 150">Even if s 557(2) does not apply to a case to oblige to treat as one contravention all the consequences of a particular piece of conduct, it is open to the Court, in an appropriate case, to take into account, as a matter of discretion, the circumstance that the same acts or omissions have resulted in multiple contraventions by multiple breaches of a term cast in similar language in each of multiple agreements, by imposing a lesser penalty or even no penalty in respect of breaches of some terms, while imposing a substantial penalty in respect of breaches of other terms ( Gibbs v Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of Altona [1992] FCA 374 ; (1992) 37 FCR 216 at 233; Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at 17). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2010] FCA 1382">And no statement should itself be mechanically applied in substitution for a proper exercise of the discretion conferred by reference to the facts and circumstances of each particular case and by reference to the objects and purposes of the particular statute being applied.

<sentence id="cs16" from="[2010] FMCA 956">26. Fourthly and finally, having fixed an appropriate penalty for each group of contraventions or course of conduct, the Court should take a final look at the aggregate penalty, to determine whether it is an appropriate response to the conduct which led to the breaches. [14] The Court should apply an "instinctive synthesis" in making this assessment. [15] This is what is known as an application of the "totality principle".  In Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v Mc Alary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 Buchanan J after referring to the decision in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 said at [9]: "9. Checklists of this kind can be useful providing they do not become transformed into a rigid catalogue of matters for attention. At the end of the day the task of the Court is to fix a penalty which pays appropriate regard to the circumstances in which the contraventions have occurred and the need to sustain public confidence in the statutory regime which imposes the obligations..."  This summary was adopted by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14.

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2010] FMCA 905">The applicant accepts that the respondents ran a small business. However, in oral submissions, the applicant submitted that it was irrelevant that the respondents' business was small.

When it does not it will, normally, be necessary to mark the failure by imposing an appropriate monetary sanction. Such a sanction "must be imposed at a meaningful level": see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd [2001] FCA 383 ; [2001] ATPR 41-815 at [13] .

 The applicant accepted that in this case, although there were repeated breaches, many of them fell within a single course of conduct, such that they should be treated as one breach. Consequently, the applicant submitted, and the respondent accepted, that: all of the failures to pay casual loading in breach of s.185(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 ("WR Act") as a term of the AFPCS should be treated as a single breach, in respect of which the maximum penalty for: the first respondent, is $33,000; and the second and third respondents, is $6,600 each; all of the failures to pay overtime in breach of clause 37.2 of the Award should be treated as a single breach, in respect of which the maximum penalty for: the first respondent, is $33,000; and the second and third respondents, is $6,600 each; all of the failures to pay additional overtime for casual employees in breach of clause 12.5.4 of the Award should be treated as a single breach, in respect of which the maximum penalty for: the first respondent, is $33,000; and the second and third respondents, is $6,600 each; all of the failures to pay shift allowance in breach of clause 34.9 of the Award should be treated as a single breach, in respect of which the maximum penalty for: the first respondent, is $33,000; and the second and third respondents, is $6,600 each; as they overlap, all of the failures to make or cause to be made a record of the rate of remuneration paid to an employee in breach of regulation 19.11(1) of the WR Regs and all of the failures to record the hours worked by an employee in breach of regulation 19.11(2) of the WR Regs should be treated as a single breach, in respect of which the maximum penalty for: the first respondent, is $5,500; and the third respondent, is $1,100; all of the failures to issue written payslips in compliance with regulation 19.20(3) of the WR Regs should be treated as a single breach, in respect of which the maximum penalty for: the first respondent, is $5,500; and the third respondent, is $1,100. Consequently, the maximum total penalties that could be imposed in this case are: $148,500.00 for the first respondent; $26,400 for the second respondent; and $29,700 for the third respondent. Relevant factors in determining penalty 
 The applicant submitted, and the respondents accepted, that a convenient checklist of the factors that the court might consider in determining penalty include the matters that were identified by Mowbray FM in Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd t/as Pangaea Restaurant &amp; Bar [2007] FMCA 7 at [26] - [59] and adopted by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick (2007) 166 IR 14 ; [2007] FCA 1080 at [14] .

Tracey J adopted those considerations and described them as follows: The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches. The circumstances in which that conduct took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2010] FMCA 621">Finally, having fixed an appropriate penalty for each group of contraventions or course of conduct, the Court should take a final look at the aggregate penalty, to determine whether it is an appropriate response to the conduct which led to the breaches [21] .

 Identification of the contraventions
  This summary was adopted by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [28] .

  This summary was adopted by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick (2007) 166 IR 14 ; [2007] FCA 1080 , [14].

<sentence id="cs22" from="[2010] FMCA 828">In terms of the groupings, exhibit 6 identifies those matters and as I noted, identifies, in effect, 24 discrete contraventions. As to factors relevant to penalty, those matters have been traversed on many occasions before today. The principles are broadly identified in the decisions of Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 , Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 and Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Limited v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 and I will not restate them today. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2010] FMCA 763">The considerations to be taken into account in assessment of penalty are well established, [13] and are as follows: the nature and extent of the conduct which led to the contraventions; the circumstances of the conduct (including deliberate defiance or disregard of the relevant legislative provisions); relevant record of civil penalty contraventions; whether the contraventions are distinct or arise from a single course of conduct; the consequences of the contravening conduct; deterrence, both general and specific; the objects of the relevant legislation; the size and financial resources of the contravener; co-operation with regulatory authorities; the contravener's contrition; the size of the prescribed penalty, and any recent increases to that prescription; and the totality principle.

<sentence id="cs24" from="[2010] FMCA 764">The financial position of the respondents in their capacity to pay and the deterrent effect of the proposed penalty, citing Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080. I accept that these are all relevant matters, and I also accept the general argument that when considering this notice to produce I should look at the penalty aspect as much as I would have looked at the substantive aspect if it had not been accepted that the claims in relation thereto were admitted. In regard to the second overarching ground, I note that the respondents have not put on any evidence which would indicate the nature of the oppressiveness; for example, they have not deposed to the fact that their records contain large numbers of documents that would have to be gone through manually as opposed to being contained on computers where a search might be made very quickly. They have not argued that their documents are no longer readily available, having been sent to storage, nor that there would be expense involved which they are able to define with some reasonable accuracy. Bearing these matters in mind, I will now look at each of the categories. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2010] FMCA 806">Next is the size of the enterprise involved. In this case the first respondent has ceased trading. That matter, however, should not be of any great moment for as Tracey J noted in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 whether they are large corporate employers, or small businesses each have an obligation to meet minimum employment standards and their employees rightly. There is an expectation this will occur. When it does not, it will normally be necessary to mark the failure by imposing an appropriate monetary sanction. Such a sanction must be imposed in a meaningful level. </sentence>

I bear steadfastly in mind the observations of Giles J in A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466 at [6] : "... the discretion is at large. There are no mandatory statutory criteria and it is wrong to regard factors seen as relevant by one court as statutory criteria.

At this point, consideration of the appropriate penalty to impose in respect of each course of conduct can be made, having regard to all of the circumstances of the case. Finally, having fixed an appropriate penalty for each group of contraventions or courses of conduct, an appropriate penalty can be determined by assessing whether it is an appropriate response to the conduct which led to the breaches: Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 per Tracey J at [30]. In Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd (supra) per Gray J at [27] and Graham J at [55] and [78] their Honours indicated that the Court should apply an "instinctive synthesis" in making this assessment. The factors relevant to the imposition of a penalty under the WR Act have been summarised in the frequently quoted decision of Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd t/as Pangaea Restaurants and Bars [2007] FMCA 7 per Mowbray FM which was subsequently adopted in Kelly v Fitzpatrick (supra) per Tracey J at [14].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2010] FMCA 694">It is generally accepted that the approach to be adopted in determining an appropriate penalty is in accordance with the approach adopted by Mowbray FM in Mason v Harrington Corporation Limited trading as Pangaea Restaurant and Bar (above) (approved in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 at [14] , Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FC AFC 8 at [46] and in Blandy v Coverdale NT Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1533). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2010] FCAFC 90">Analogous "course of conduct" provisions are to be found in predecessor federal industrial relations legislation. Though he noted differences in language as between s 719 of the WR Act and such earlier provisions, Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at 17 at [11], correctly in my respectful opinion, considered that the following observation of Gray J in Gibbs v The Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of City of Altona [1992] FCA 374 ; (1992) 37 FCR 216 at 223, made in respect of the then s 178 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 ( Cth), provided an accurate guide to the meaning and effect of s 719(2) of the WR Act: 
The object of s 178(2) appears to be that a party bound by an award and pursuing a course of conduct involving repeated acts or omissions, which would ordinarily be regarded as giving rise to a series of separate breaches, should not be punished separately for each of those breaches. If such a party has pursued a course of conduct which gives rise to breaches of several different obligations, there is no reason why it should be treated as immune in respect of its breach of one obligation, merely because it has acted in breach of another. This reasoning leads to the conclusion that each separate obligation found in an award is to be regarded as a "term", for the purposes of s 178 of the Act. The ascertainment of what is a term should depend not on matters of form, such as how the award maker has chosen to designate by numbers or letters the various provisions of an award, but on matters of substance, namely the different obligations which can be spelt out. For these reasons, I incline to the view that each separate obligation imposed by an award is to be regarded as a "term", for the purposes of s 178 of the Act. If the different terms impose cumulative obligations or obligations that substantially overlap, it is possible to take into account the substance of the matter by imposing no penalty, or a nominal penalty, in respect of breaches of some terms, but a substantial penalty in respect of others.

<sentence id="cs30" from="[2010] FCA 688">In Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at 18-19 I identified a non-exhaustive list of considerations which were of potential relevance in determining an appropriate penalty to be imposed for breaches of an award. Most of those considerations are also relevant in determining an appropriate penalty under s 665 of the Act: see Claveria v Pilkington Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 1917 at [3] - [5] (per Kenny J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs31" from="[2010] FCA 648">The question which then arises is the amount of penalty to be imposed. In Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at [7] --- [8] Branson J set out some of the considerations to be taken into account in assessing a penalty in respect of a contravention of Pt XA (as it then was) of the WR Act: 
 
 
 The [WR] Act gives no explicit guidance as to the circumstances in which an order imposing a penalty under s 298U [as it then was] of the Act will be appropriate or as to the circumstances in which a penalty of or near the maximum, or alternatively of a lesser amount, may be called for. The Court is simply directed to consider what is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. 
 
 

 
 
 
 The following matters, which are not intended to comprise an exhaustive list, seem to me to be considerations to which the Court may appropriately have regard in determining whether particular conduct calls for the imposition of a penalty, and assuming that it does, the amount of the penalty: 
 
 

 
 
 
 (a) The circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place (including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act); 
 
 

 
 
 
 (b) Whether the respondent has previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of Pt XA of the Act; 
 
 

 
 
 
 (c) Where more than one contravention of Pt XA is involved, whether the various contraventions are properly seen as distinct or whether they arise out of the one course of conduct; 
 
 

 
 
 
 (d) The consequences of the conduct found to be in contravention of Pt XA of the Act; 
 
 

 
 
 
 (e) The need, in the circumstances, for the protection of industrial freedom of association; and 
 
 

 
 
 
 (f) The need, in the circumstances, for deterrence.

As I have noted in previous cases, a list of considerations can guide, but is not a substitute for "the unrestrained statutory discretion" (cf. Gyles J in Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 at [11] ). Ultimately, I must arrive at an amount within the range of penalties provided in the legislation which is proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed and also takes into account other sentencing considerations including deterrence (cf.

It is agreed that the total of annual leave entitlements of the first respondent --- what the first respondent was required to pay, Mr Thompson, was $9821.41 plus interest. I have outlined the circumstances of the case above and, as is earlier noted, the facts indicate a contravention by omission rather than by commission. By that I mean that there are serious questions about whether or not it could be said that what the respondent sought to do was to, in fact, short change or cheat the employee out of his due entitlements. There are no allegations of any prior contraventions. The size of the enterprise involved is relatively small, but, as Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [3] noted: 
 "No less than large corporate employers, small businesses have an obligation to meet minimum employment standards and their employees rightly have an expectation that this will occur.

When it does not it will, normally, be necessary to mark the failure by imposing an appropriate monetary sanction. Such a sanction must be imposed at a meaningful level.  Compliance with minimum standards is important. Again, in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at 20 Tracey J said: One of the principal objects of the Act is the maintenance of a safety net of minimum terms and conditions of employment and effective enforcement of the obligations imposed by Awards and other industrial instruments. To this end the Act makes provision for the investigation of alleged breaches where it is established that breaches have occurred. As already noted, those penalties were significantly increased by parliament in 2004.  The approach to be taken when determining the imposition of a penalty appears not to be in dispute. The applicant referred me to the non-exhaustive list of relevant factors summarised by Mowbray FM in Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd t/as Pangaea Restaurant &amp; Bar [2007] FMCA 7 at [26] - [59] and endorsed by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at [14] . Those factors are: the nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches; the circumstances in which that conduct took place; the nature and extent of any loss or damage sustained as a result of the breaches; whether there has been similar previous conduct by the respondent; whether the breaches were properly distinct or arose out of the one course of conduct; the size of the business enterprise involved; whether or not the breaches were deliberate; whether senior management was involved in the breaches; whether the party committing the breach had exhibited contrition; whether the party committing the breach had taken corrective action; whether the party committing the breach had cooperated with the enforcement authorities; the need to ensure compliance with minimum standards by provision of an effective means for investigation and enforcement of employee entitlements; and the need for specific and general deterrence. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs54" from="[2009] FCA 1040">As noted above, where (as here) penalties are being imposed for a number of related contraventions, it is necessary to ensure that the penalties in aggregate are just and appropriate to the circumstances of the case. As Tracey J said in Stuart-Mohoney 177 IR at 73 [60]: 
 
 
 Another factor to be considered is the totality principle. This principle is designed to ensure that the aggregate of penalties imputed is not such as to be oppressive or crushing see: Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at [30] referred to with approval by Buchanan J in Australian Opthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 at [89] . The orthodox position requires the determination of appropriate penalties for each contravention arising from the same course of conduct. The aggregate figure is then considered to ensure that the penalty is an appropriate response to the conduct in question see: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1997) 75 FCR 238 ; 145 ALR 36 at 53 and Ponzio at [145] per Jessup J. 
 
 

Penalties must also be proportionate to the culpability and seriousness of the respondent's contravening conduct and sufficient to mark the seriousness of that conduct. Neither respondent has expressed any contrition. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs55" from="[2009] FMCA 853">Her Honour provided a list of considerations that the court may appropriately have regard to in determining whether particular conduct called for the imposition of a penalty and the amount of the penalty. I have considered all of the circumstances of this case on the evidence before the Court, including the matters referred to in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 (and see e.g. Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14) , in particular the circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place (including whether it was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act); whether the second respondent had previously engaged in conduct in contravention of the Act; whether more than one contravention was involved and whether such contraventions were properly seen as distinct or arising out of the one course of conduct; the consequences of the conduct; the need in the particular circumstances for the protection of persons; deterrence, both general and specific; the objects of the Act; the size and financial resources of the contravener; his co-operation with any regulatory authorities; contrition; and the size of the prescribed penalty. It is also necessary to have regard to the totality principle (see Australian Opthalmic Supplies at 567 --- 568 per Gray J and 577 per Graham J. ) Circumstances, nature and consequences of the conduct and objects of the Act
 Based on the unchallenged affidavit evidence of Mr Torpia I accept that Empire Printing (which was controlled by Mr Zarfati) failed to give Mr Torpia the requisite pay in lieu of notice or any severance payment as required by clauses 6(d) and 6(e) of the Award as incorporated in a NAPSA.</sentence>

Judges of this Court have sought to isolate principles or criteria informing the exercise of the discretion to impose a pecuniary penalty and the quantum of the penalty. The observations of Branson J in Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No. 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at [8] are well known and have been applied regularly in this Court (some examples of which are Australian Nursing Federation v Alcheringa Hostel Inc.

 In relation to the circumstances and consequences of contravening conduct and the objects of the WR Act in this matter, the Court refers to the affidavit of the applicant, Mr Sims, which sets out the circumstances in which the relevant contraventions occurred. [4] It is unnecessary to deal with it in any detail but it suffices to say that the applicant was employed by the respondent in September of 2008 to do supervisory work in the building and construction industry. [5] He was employed supervising up to five other employees, doing general on-site work.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs61" from="[2009] FMCA 664">A primary objective of penalties is deterrence. [50] Therefore, in imposing civil penalties, deterrence is a significant consideration.

[52] Therefore it must be of a kind that demonstrates an appropriate assessment of the seriousness of the offending conduct. [53] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs62" from="[2009] FMCA 700">There was discussion of the manner in which penalty should be calculated in Blandy at [23]. This articulation which I set out below is one that I would respectfully adopt and which has been adopted in this court on previous occasions: "[23] In Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 (at [14]), Tracey J. adopted "a non-exhaustive range of considerations to which regard may be had in determining whether particular conduct calls for the imposition of a penalty, and if it does the amount of the penalty". This range of considerations was referred to with approval in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; 165 FCR 560 , at [60] per Graham J; and at [88---89] per Buchanan J. That list of considerations is as follows: &#8226; The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches. I have no substantive evidence about the size of this enterprise which Mr Ritchie directed. However, there seems to have been quite a number of employees. In Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; [2007] 166 IR 14 Justice Tracy opined that: "No less than large corporate employers small businesses have an obligation to meet minimum employment standards and their employees rightly have an expectation that this will occur. When it does not it will, normally, be necessary to mark the failure by imposing an appropriate monetary sanction. Such a sanction must be imposed at a meaningful level.</sentence>

Having regard to the principles set out in these cases, and in the light of the facts and the gravamen of the issues involved in these proceedings, in the event that I was required to consider matters relating to penalty it is more likely than not that little or no penalty would have been imposed. The cost of the proceedings alone, together with the educational session provided by the ABCC shortly after the incident that sparked these proceedings, would more likely have been regarded as penalty enough. However, having regard to my resolution of the matter, such things are, of course, unnecessary to determine. </sentence>

Circumstances, nature and extent of conduct
  The approach to be followed in penalty proceedings has been well established. [16] The authorities set out that the considerations so far as they are relevant for the assessment of penalty include: the nature and extent of the conduct which led to the contraventions; the circumstances of the conduct (including deliberate defiance or disregard of the WR Act); relevant record of civil penalty contraventions; whether the contraventions are distinct or arise from a single course of conduct; the consequences of the contravening conduct; deterrence, both general and specific; the objects of the WR Act; the size and financial resources of the contravener; co-operation with regulator authorities; the contravener's contrition; the size of the prescribed penalty, and any recent increases to that prescription; and the totality principle. </sentence>

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 The issue now before the Court is what penalties, if any, I should impose upon the Respondents for the contraventions of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) ("BCII Act") and the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("WR Act") that I have declared occurred on 10 December 2008.  There is a growing body of authority as to the approach that should be taken in cases such as these. Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 is often referred to, subject to the qualifications set out in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 ("Ophthalmic Supplies") per Buchanan J at [91]. I have had regard to those authorities but would add reference to the following observation of Gyles J in A. &amp; L. Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466 (" Silvestri "), at [6]: "A number of authorities discuss the factors to be taken into account in fixing a penalty, many of them borrowing from related fields, including the criminal law. It is sufficient to refer to the recent case of Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 as an example. However, the discretion is at large. There are no mandatory statutory criteria and it is wrong to regard factors seen as relevant by one court as statutory criteria. Indeed, lists of factors can confuse an essentially straightforward task and lead to over-elaborate reasoning.

There is no evidence that TKM has put in place mechanisms which are designed to ensure that there will be no repetition of the breaches which have led to the present proceeding. Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 at [28]. 6.13.9. The breaches involve the employment of employees engaged on a casual basis in an industry which is vulnerable. In Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 it was said: "Different views have been expressed as to the manner in which the principle ought properly to be applied ... the orthodox position ... which I consider should be adopted, is that the starting point is the determination of appropriate penalties for each contravention of the statutory norm.

<sentence id="cs72" from="[2009] FMCA 236">At [60] of Australian Ophthalmic (supra) Justice Graham refers to the following passage by Justice Tracey in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 that identified at [14] various considerations that were potentially relevant as follows: "The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches. &#8226; The circumstances in which that conduct took place. &#8226; The nature and extent of any loss or damage sustained as a result of the breaches. In Stuart Mahoney v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1426 at [39] and [40] Justice Tracey set out the potentially relevant considerations for determining the appropriate penalty for a contravention of the BCII Act. Those paras provide: "39 In Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 I set out a non-exhaustive range of considerations to which regard may be had in determining whether conduct calls for a penalty, and if so, the amount of such penalty. These considerations were derived from a number of decisions of this Court including Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd [1991] HCA 7 ; [1991] ATPR 52 ,135 (41-076) (which concerned contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)) and Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 (which concerned contraventions of Part XA of the WR Act). 40 In my view, potentially relevant and applicable considerations for determining the appropriate penalty for a contravention of the BCII Act include: &#8226; The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches.</sentence>

In CFMEU v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No.2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at [7] - [8], Branson J identified an additional consideration as relevant to the assessment of penalty in freedom of association proceedings, namely, the need in the circumstances, for the protection of industrial freedom of association (albeit in the context of a contravention of Part XA of the WR Act as it existed prior to the amendments made by the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth)) (" the Pre-Reform Act ").

<sentence id="cs96" from="[2008] FMCA 1028">In Gibbs v The Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of the City of Altona (1992) 37 FCR 216 Gray J stated at 223: The object of s 178(2) appears to be that a party bound by an award and pursuing a course of conduct involving repeated acts or omissions, which would ordinarily be regarded as giving rise to a series of separate breaches, should not be punished separately for each of those breaches. If such a party has pursued a course of conduct which gives rise to breaches of several different obligations, there is no reason why it should be treated as immune in respect of its breach of one obligation, merely because it has acted in breach of another. This reasoning leads to the conclusion that each separate obligation found in an award is to be regarded as a "term", for the purposes of s 178 of the Act. The ascertainment of what is a term should depend not on matters of form, such as how the award maker has chosen to designate by numbers or letters the various provisions of an award, but on matters of substance, namely the different obligations which can be spelt out. For these reasons, I incline to the view that each separate obligation imposed by an award is to be regarded as a "term", for the purposes of s 178 of the Act. If the different terms impose cumulative obligations or obligations that substantially overlap, it is possible to take into account the substance of the matter by imposing no penalty, or a nominal penalty, in respect of breaches of some terms, but a substantial penalty in respect of others.

The second way in which the court was said to be required to apply the totality principle was that having fixed an appropriate penalty for each course of conduct, the court should take a " final look " at the aggregate penalty to determine whether it was an appropriate response to the conduct which led to the breaches and was not oppressive or crushing as discussed in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at [30] per Tracey J and Australian Ophthalmic Supplies at [23] per Gray J, at [71] per Graham J, and [102] per Buchanan J.

The choice of penalty must be dictated by the individual circumstances of the case, not by a line by line comparison with another case (per Gray J at [12] and Buchanan J at [91]). These observations mirror the remarks of Burchett J in Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Ltd (1995) ATPR 40 , 161 at 40,165 where Burchett J said: "It cannot be denied that the fixing of the quantum of penalty is not an exact science. It is not done by the application of a formula, and within a certain range, courts have always recognised that one precise figure cannot be incontestably said to be preferable to another. " The task of the Court is to fix a penalty which pays appropriate regard to the circumstances in which the contraventions have occurred and the need to sustain public confidence in the statutory regime which imposes the obligations (per Buchanan J at [91]). The Court must apply the totality principle, which means determining an appropriate level of penalty for each contravention and then to look at the aggregate of the penalties in light of the overall conduct of the appellant to form a view as to whether that aggregate was out of proportion to the overall conduct (per Gray J at [23], per Graham J at [71], per Buchanan J at [102]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs110" from="[2008] FMCA 311">This was affirmed in the decision: Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 per Tracey J at [14] where his Honour stated: [14] In Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 Mowbray FM identified "a non-exhaustive range of considerations to which regard may be had in determining whether particular conduct calls for the imposition of a penalty, and if it does the amount of the penalty". Those considerations were derived from a number of decisions of this Court. I gratefully adopt, as potentially relevant and applicable, the various considerations identified by him. The maximum applicable penalty in this case is $115,500, in respect of the five breaches alleged by the applicant. It is submitted that in determining the pecuniary penalties for multiple individual breaches it is appropriate for the Court to apply the totality principle ensuring that the penalty in aggregate is just and appropriate in all circumstances: CPSU v Telstra Corporation [2001] FCA 1364 ; (2001) 108 IR 228 at [230] ; Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7. The orthodox approach to applying the totality principle was adopted by his Honour Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 at [30] where his Honour stated: [30] ... The orthodox position, however, which I consider should be adopted, is that the starting point is the determination of appropriate penalties for each contravention of the statutory norm. The aggregate figure is then considered with a view to ensuring that it is an appropriate response to the conduct which led to the breaches: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1997) 145 ALR 36 at 53. See also Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 at [145] per Jessup J. This approach was recently described, in the criminal context from which the totality principle is derived, as "the orthodox, but not necessarily immutable, practice" adopted by sentencing courts: see Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15 ; (2004) 205 ALR 346 at 356[26] per Gummow, Callinan &amp; Heydon JJ. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs111" from="[2008] FMCA 288">As Tracey J said in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 at [14] , in Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Limited [2007] FMCA 7 at [24] Mowbray FM identified "a non-exhaustive range of considerations to which regard may be had in determining whether particular conduct calls for the imposition of a penalty, and if it does the amount of the penalty". Tracey J adopted those considerations and described them as follows: The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches. The circumstances in which that conduct took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs112" from="[2008] FCAFC 8">60 In the recent decision of Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ('Kelly v Fitzpatrick') his Honour identified various considerations which were potentially relevant at [14] as follows:
 
 '&#8226; The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches. 
 
 
 &#8226; The circumstances in which that conduct took place. 
 &#8226; The nature and extent of any loss or damage sustained as a result of the breaches. 89 In a recent judgment Tracey J adopted this same list of factors as 'potentially relevant and applicable' (see Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080). The list of factors is as follows:
 
 '&#8226; The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches. 
 &#8226; The circumstances in which that conduct took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs113" from="[2008] FMCA 101">Counsel for both parties are now in agreement as to the other relevant current provisions of the Workplace Relations Act , and the principles which I should follow when applying them. It is therefore not necessary for me to discuss them at length, since they have been identified in other recent decisions of this Court and the Federal Court (see, for example, Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 , Flattery v The Italian Eatery [2007] FMCA 9 , Cotis v Pow Juice Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 140 , Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 , Jordan v Mornington Inn Proprietary Limited [2007] FCA 1384 , Coles v Elsen Bros Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 1838 , and Dennington v Pee Cee Pty Ltd [2008] FMCA 79). At a factual level, these cases concerned a wide range of circumstances, and I consider it too early to discern a "tariff" of penalties usually awarded in this Court for underpayment of workers' entitlements. However, I have attempted to be consistent in this case with their approach to the determination of penalties. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs116" from="[2007] FMCA 2060">I also agree with paragraph 19 of the written submissions in relation to the size of the respondent's business. In that regard I reiterate the observations on that point that I made in Rajagopalan v B M Sydney Building Materials Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 1412 at paragraphs 27 to 29: Employers must not be left under the impression that because of their size or financial difficulty that they are able to breach an award. [1] Obligations by employers for adherence to industrial instruments arise regardless of their size. Such a factor should be of limited relevance to the Court's consideration of penalty. As stated recently, by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 , at [28]: No less than large corporate employers, small businesses have an obligation to meet minimum employment standards and their employees, rightly, have an expectation that this will occur. When it does not it will, normally be necessary to mark the failure by imposing an appropriate monetary sanction. Such a sanction must be imposed at a meaningful level. ...  In Rajagopalan I dealt with the totality principle in paragraphs 33 to 44. I also had regard in that case to penalties awarded in comparable circumstances. I reiterate in this matter that a factor which should be taken into account in fixing the pecuniary penalties for multiple breaches is the totality principle. As in Rajagopalan I adopt, with respect, the observations of Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080.  The applicant, through her counsel, has provided submissions in relation to the relief sought both orally and in writing. I, in essence, agree with those submissions. In particular I adopt, with respect, paragraphs 6 to 12: The applicable principles in relation to penalties in such matters are uncontroversial ( Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080). In Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 , Mowbray FM identified 'a non-exhaustive range of considerations to which regard may be had in determining whether particular conduct calls for the imposition of a penalty, and if it does the amount of the penalty'. They are: the nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches; the circumstances in which that conduct took place; the nature and extent of any loss or damage sustained as a result of the breaches; whether there had been similar previous conduct by the respondent; whether the breaches were properly distinct or arose out of the one course of conduct; </sentence>

<sentence id="cs124" from="[2007] FCA 1397">20 Regulation 2.14 of Ch 7 of the Workplace Regulations provides support for this conclusion. As Tracey J observed in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 at [7] , that regulation authorises a workplace inspector to institute a proceeding in respect of an alleged breach of a matter under the old Act. I note incidentally that the maximum penalties prescribed by the old Act for a breach of s 178 are the same as the maximum penalties now prescribed by the new Act under which s 178 has been renumbered s 719.
