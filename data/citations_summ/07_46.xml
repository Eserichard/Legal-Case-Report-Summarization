<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NFSC 5">50 His Honour's statement has been treated as settled law in Australia: Restom v Battenberg [2007] FCA 46 , affirmed in Battenberg v Restom [2007] FCAFC 195. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1323">In January 2001, he was issued with an Australian passport in the name of Battenberg. At about this time, he also acquired a British passport in the name of Lord Battenberg. From 2004, he was resident in either Dunfalllandy House, Scotland or in London with his partner who he claimed supported him. Since that time he had returned to Australia on a number of occasions for short visits to see his mother lasting three or four days: Restrom v Battenberg [2007] FCA 46. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCAFC 195">7 Mr Russo's letter of 3 March 2005 and Mr Battenberg's notice of appeal were each alleged by them to contain errors made by those who physically typed them. The first error was attributed by Mr Russo to his secretary. The second error was attributed to "an unnamed assistant" by Mr Battenberg: Restom [2007] FCA 46 at [25] . 1 The appellant, Mr Battenberg, appeals from a judgment of Stone J, in which her Honour ordered that his estate be sequestrated; see, Restom v Battenberg [2007] FCA 46. The issue to be determined in this appeal is whether as at 6 June 2005, Mr Battenberg was ordinarily resident in Australia. 8 Justice Stone found Mr Battenberg to be an unreliable witness who was "prepared to say whatever he thinks best suits his interests": Restom [2007] FCA 46 at [39] . Her Honour was not prepared to accept his evidence without independent corroboration. Her Honour considered Mr Russo to lack candour. She found that his letter of 3 March 2005 was written in accordance with instructions given to him by Mr Battenberg and that it said what Mr Russo intended it to say. Her Honour also found that the notice of appeal showed that Mr Battenberg considered himself to be ordinarily resident in Australia as at 4 May and 7 June 2005.</sentence>
