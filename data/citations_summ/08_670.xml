<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 900">6 Quite apart from the lack of proper proof, and consideration of the context, this does not add anything. As pointed out in the substantive judgment [2008] FCA 670 at [21] , if works do not have approval under the EPBC Act and in fact have significant impact on matters of national environmental significance, persons carrying out the works face criminal sanctions. However, as will shortly be mentioned in regard to the case against the State of Victoria, there was no proof that any such impact was likely.  1 On 16 May 2008 I gave judgment for the respondents and directed written submissions as to costs: Your Water Your Say Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 670.  4 The case against the first respondent, the Federal Minister, in my opinion had no arguable merit. It was plain that no relevant decision was made by the Federal Minister about the Preliminary Works. Neither respondent contended that the delegate's observation in the s 75 decision that the Preliminary Works did not "require approval under the EPBC Act" had any legal effect. The applicant submitted that it "won the point --- there was no 'approval'". But the respondents never suggested there was. It was not a case of "de facto approval": see [2008] FCA 670 at [17] --- [21]. </sentence>
