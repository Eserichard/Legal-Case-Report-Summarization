 The law is clear that failure to consider a submission of substance which, if accepted, would be capable of affecting the outcome of the case, constitutes an error of law ( WAEE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 ; Casarotto v Australian Postal Corporation [1989] FCA 116 ; (1989) 10 AAR 191 at 195 ; Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 ATR 1122 at 1130; [ Australian Postal Corporation v ] Sellick [(2008) 49 AAR 108] at [35].

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 147">On 19 November 2004, the day following the dismissal of his appeal, Mr House requested the Authority to review his classification. His request appears to have incorporated a request that his personality disorder and injuries to his arm, sustained in motor vehicle accidents, be accepted as being causally connected with the impairment of alcoholism. On 14 March 2005 the delegate of the Authority rejected the request on the footing that the Authority had previously rejected those conditions as causally related conditions and that that decision had been affirmed by a Tribunal in a decision not disturbed on appeal. The decision was confirmed on reconsideration in a decision sent to Mr House on 1 August 2005. It is the decision, later confirmed on reconsideration, which is the subject matter of this application. The matter was heard and determined by the Tribunal [8] , differently constituted, however that decision was the subject of a successful appeal and order for remittal for re-hearing [9] .

Woodward and Foster JJ agreed. Subsequently, in Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick , supra , at [35], Bennett J also referred to the need to address a submission of " substance " or a submission which would have " affected the outcome ".
