<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCAFC 60">2 Their appeal seeks to overturn the exercise of a discretion by a Judge of this Court who granted leave to join them as additional respondents to proceedings commenced against a valuation company and one of its valuers (who are the second and third respondents to this appeal). The orders and judgment under appeal were made and was delivered on 4 July 2006 ( Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 847). The judgment of 4 July 2006, in large part, reflected reasons in an earlier judgment of 29 May 2006 ( Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Limited [2006] FCA 640). Both judgments, read together, provide the reasons for the orders for joinder, made on 4 July 2006. Leave to appeal was given by a Judge exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Court on 28 September 2006 ( Macquarie Underwriting Pty Ltd v Permanent Custodians Limited [2006] FCA 1291).  62 When the Amended Notice of Motion was before the primary judge the parties were in agreement that an action could not be brought against the insurer without the leave of the court, any grant of leave or otherwise falling ultimately within the statutory discretion vested in the court by s 6 of the LR(MP) Act. The parties were further in agreement that a Court would not grant leave where, on the basis of the material before the Court, the claim for the statutory indemnity sought was not reasonably arguable ( Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Limited [2006] FCA 640 at [5] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1291">3 In essence it is submitted that there is no arguable case against the insurers, that they have been incorrectly joined in the proceedings and that the primary judge erred in joining the insurers and finding a reasonable cause of action against them in Permanent (No 2) on 4 July 2006 and Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 640 (' Permanent (No 1) ') on 29 May 2006.</sentence>
