<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 217">The Minister drew attention, in submissions, to a question as to whether the proceeding was one within jurisdiction. Attention was directed to the following passage in MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 where Young J at [9] stated: 
 
 The appropriate course for the applicant to adopt would have been to apply to have the decision of O'Dwyer FM set aside pursuant to r 16.05(2), rather than appealing in this court. It has been doubted, in any event, whether this Court can entertain an appeal for a decision to dismiss an application for want of appearance: see the judgments of Sundberg J in MZWIK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 185 and VOAQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1505. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 568">When exercising the discretion to grant or refuse leave to appeal from the interlocutory decision in the present proceeding, a further matter relevant to the exercise of that discretion is the right conferred by Rule 16.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 . When considering an application for leave to appeal in circumstances where a proceeding had likewise been struck out for want of attendance, Young J in MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 said: 
 
 [9] The appropriate course for the applicant to adopt would have been to apply to have the decision of O'Dwyer FM set aside pursuant to r 16.05(2), rather than appealing in this Court. It has been doubted, in any event, whether this Court can entertain an appeal from a decision to dismiss an application for want of appearance: see the judgments of Sundberg J in MZWIK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 185 (" MZWIK ") and VOAQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1505. 
 

 
 The applicant in that case had also failed to appear before the Federal Court. Rather than dismissing the proceeding before the Federal Court pursuant to s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), Young J went on to consider whether there was sufficient merit to warrant the grant of leave. Leave was refused. This was the course also followed by Ryan J in MZXAU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1558. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1323">24 As this is an application for leave to appeal from the refusal of the Federal Magistrates Court to reinstate the application for judicial review, the applicant has in fact taken the course indicated by Young J as appropriate in those circumstances in MZWXC v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172. His Honour there said, at [9];
 'The appropriate course for the applicant to adopt would have been to apply to have the decision of O'Dwyer FM set aside pursuant to r 16.05(2), rather than appealing in this Court. It has been doubted, in any event, whether this Court can entertain an appeal from a decision to dismiss an application for want of appearance: see the judgments of Sundberg J in MZWIK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 185 ("MZWIK") and VOAQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1505.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 729">12 As is apparent from what I have said, I have taken the course I adopted in MZWIK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 185 (see also MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 at [9] and MZXME v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 767) , and instead of requiring the applicant to take the proper course, have considered whether there is sufficient merit in his case to justify the grant of leave to appeal. Plainly there is not.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 429">3 The first respondent's submissions have considerable force. At least three judges of this Court have expressed doubt as to whether this Court can entertain an appeal from a decision to dismiss an application because of the non attendance of the applicant, at least in the first instance: see MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 at [9] per Young J, MZWIK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 185 at [3] and VOAQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1505 at [10] per Sundberg J, and MZWFV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 923 per North J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 1110">


 
14 It is clear that, in the circumstances of this case, an application could have been made and, indeed, could still be made, under sub-rule (2)(a) or (c) of that rule. Accordingly, I agree with the observations of Young J in MZWXC v the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 where his Honour said at [9];

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 769">7 Having regard to the history of this matter, I am not persuaded that I should adjourn this proceeding. The objection to competency is plainly well taken. A decision to dismiss an application by reason of the absence of the applicant is a decision of an interlocutory nature. Pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court cannot be brought from such a decision without leave. See generally NACA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 659 at [15] per Hely J; MZWQH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1491 at [26] per Kenny J; and MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 at [9] per Young J.</sentence>

16 It is clear that, in the circumstances of this case, an application could have been made, and, indeed, could still be made under subrule (2) (a) or (c) of that rule. In these circumstances, I agree with respect with the observations of Young J in MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) FCA 172 where his Honour said, at [9];

' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2006] FCA 1426">9 In summary, the respondent has submitted:
 
&#8226; Where an appeal arises from a decision which has now been set aside, the appeal should be dismissed and the appellant ordered to pay the respondent's costs of and incidental to the appeal. &#8226; The appropriate way to proceed in relation to decisions in the Federal Magistrates Court under r 13.10 is to make an application to set aside the decision under r 16.05. The appellant eventually did this and was successful in having the decision set aside. This approach has been endorsed in a number of cases including MZWXC v MIMIA [2006] FCA 172 and MLGXAL v MIMIA [2006] FCA 966. &#8226; The appeal in this matter was always misconceived as to the proper course to proceed, and incompetent as no application for leave to appeal was filed. &#8226; The decision of Jarrett FM on the substantive hearing has no relevance to this appeal. Further, Ms Wheatley for the respondent submitted in Court this morning that costs in this appeal bear no relevance to the new matter before Jarrett FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2006] FCA 966">By notice filed on 17 March 2006, the respondent Minister objects to the competency of this Court to hear this appeal. The respondent contends that the judgment of Riethmuller FM is an interlocutory judgment and, pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), an appeal cannot be brought from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court that is interlocutory unless leave is given. See MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 (" MZWXC "). Pursuant to O 52 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules , such leave must be sought within 21 days of the pronouncement of the interlocutory judgment. No such leave has been sought. Nor has any application been made for an extension of time within which to bring an application for leave to appeal. </sentence>
