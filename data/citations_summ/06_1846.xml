<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 2108">7 Junior counsel for the Applicants on 13 December 2007 quite properly accepted that the variation sought was not premised upon any current apprehension of any real possibility that evidence would now be destroyed. The absence of such evidence would make it inappropriate to make an order at the outset: see, eg, AAA Embroidery &amp; Screen Printing Pty Ltd v Dan [2006] FCA 1846. The absence of such evidence at the time that a variation of an order is sought equally renders it inappropriate to invoke O 25B. </sentence>
