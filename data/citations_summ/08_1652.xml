<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 121">In GP International this Court was dealing with an argument that a receipt was disbursable by the taxpayer and should not for that reason be treated as income, and was not enjoining courts in the future from examining the whole of a transaction to identify the quality of a receipt. [footnote not included, underlining provided by the applicant]
 [69] The gravamen of these authorities is, it is submitted, that the question whether a receipt, or the right to receive an amount in the future, is to be regarded as income in a particular period is not necessarily determined by merely looking at the juristic form of a transaction or transactions and the legal rights purportedly conferred by the documents evidencing that or those transactions. Rather, not unlike the enquiry necessary to determine whether an outgoing is made on revenue or capital account, it is necessary in some cases to take into account the whole factual matrix of the taxpayer's activities, including any wider or composite transaction of which the receipt, or the right to receive an amount in the future, forms part [1] .

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1653">227 This is the same issue that arose, was considered and decided in Business &amp; Research Management Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1652 in respect of the management fees. Here, it is in respect of the research fees, but it arises out of the same factual background. 2 These appeals were heard immediately following the hearing of the appeals by Business and Research Management Limited (in liquidation) ('BARM'). Notwithstanding that the issues in these appeals are not coterminous with the issues in the BARM appeals, there is a possible common issue and they arise out of the same factual background, which is set out in [4] --- [41] of the reasons for judgment in Business &amp; Research Management Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1652. The roles of ATTORI and AARI as the researchers in the Budplan projects are referred to at various parts of that background. In particular, it is noted at [8(3)] that ATTORI was engaged to conduct research and development for all projects except for Budplan 'A' Series No. 1 and Personal Budplan No. 5, where AARI was engaged to conduct the research and development activities. Unless the context indicates otherwise, terms defined in the BARM reasons that are used in these reasons, have the same meaning.</sentence>
