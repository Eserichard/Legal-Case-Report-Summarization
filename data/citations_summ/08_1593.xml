<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1186">In that case his Honour made an order that the amendment to the Deed Poll did not preclude approval of the scheme of arrangement. The form of the order is not set out in the report of the judgment but appears in the unreported version of the judgment in [2008] FCA 1593. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 864">Section 411(6) permits the court to approve a scheme of arrangement subject to such alterations as it thinks just. The section does not circumscribe the extent of the power. No doubt, it is available in many circumstances. In Re Matine Ltd (1998) 28 ACSR 268 , 284 Santow J said: 
 The discretion of the court under s 411(6) is at large, but the court would obviously have regard to whether the proposed variation was so novel or substantial as to take the varied scheme beyond the reasonable contemplation of shareholders at the time they agreed to it. 

 
In Independent Practitioner Network Ltd, in the matter of Independent Practitioner Network Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1593 at [17] Lindgren J said:
 
 
 At least one thing is clear: the Court will not approve subject to alterations unless it is satisfied that the scheme as proposed to be altered would still have been agreed to by the requisite statutory majorities. 

 
 A more circumscribed approach is evident in the judgment of Gyles J in Re Investorinfo Limited [2005] FCA 1848 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 44. He said (at 45) if "the alteration is of a minor kind which does not really affect the details of the scheme, then the Court has power to approve the scheme as amended". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] NSWSC 1221">The court has jurisdiction under s 344(3) to approve an arrangement subject to an alteration. The principles that guide the analogous discretion under s 411(6) of the Corporations Act have been discussed in a number of cases including, in particular, the decision of Gyles J in Re Investorinfo Ltd [2005] FCA 1848. The most recent treatment of the subject is by Lindgren J in Re Independent Practitioner Network Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1593. It is clear that, while established categories of circumstances for the approval of amendments may be identified from the case law, the power to approve subject to amendment is broad. I respectfully adopt what was said by Lindgren J in the last-mentioned case at [16] and [17]:
 

 
 
 
 "[16] I do not purport to define or circumscribe the circumstances in which the Court may properly exercise the discretion to approve subject to alterations.</sentence>
