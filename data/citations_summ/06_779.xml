<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1057">There was thus no dispute that " sufficient reasons " must be provided " to make the system of appeals effective and to fulfil its assumptions ": Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 at [62] , 222 CLR 115 at 135 per Kirby J. It must be possible " to discern from the reasons given the actual reasoning process adopted ": Comcare Australia v Mathieson [2004] FCA 212 at [61] , [2004] FCA 212 ; 79 ALD 518 at 531 per Weinberg J. "... [T]he tribunal will have discharged its duty under s 43 if its reasons disclose its findings of fact, the evidence on which they were based and the logical process by which it moved from those findings to the result in the case ": Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Homewood [2006] FCA 779 at [40] , [2006] FCA 779 ; 91 ALD 103 at 111 per French J.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] SAWCT 6">The obligation of the Tribunal in this regard has been described in various decisions. In Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Homewood [32] French J, as he then was, in the context of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act described a parallel duty as discharged if the reasons disclose the findings of fact, the evidence on which they were based and the logical process by which the Tribunal moved from those findings to the result in the case. In ACN 087 528 774 Pty Ltd (formerly Connex Trains Melbourne Pty Ltd) v Chetcuti [33] the Victorian Court of Appeal expressed the duty in the following terms: [34] 
 
 "... it is established that adequate reasons will provide an intelligible explanation of the process or path of reasoning which led the judge to the conclusion reached, and that a judge is required to consider and give adequate reasons in determining each of the substantial issues raised for determination. Where there is a conflict on the evidence, and one version is accepted and the other rejected, the judge must avert to and assign reasons for that rejection. ..."

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1923">
 

71 French J in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Homewood [2006] FCA 779 ; (2006) 91 ALD 103 made the following relevant observations, at 111:
 [40] The obligations set out in s 43 are not necessarily discharged by merely setting out findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence on which those findings are based and then stating a conclusion. There will always be some legal rule or principle or discretion to apply. It may be that a rule or principle, like the major premise of a syllogism, will embody the factual circumstance necessary to give rise to a right or liability. Then it may be sufficient to state that rule or principle in the reasons, the facts found as the minor premise, the evidence on which they are based and the result which follows. Not all, and perhaps not many results are so easily explained. Whether the reasoning is syllogistic or otherwise, the tribunal will have discharged its duty under s 43 if its reasons disclose its findings of fact, the evidence on which they were based and the logical process by which it moved from those findings to the result in the case. [41] Where a case involves the exercise of a discretion, the tribunal's duty is not discharged by setting out the findings of fact necessary to enliven the relevant discretion. That is so even in a case in which the enlivening facts are of an evaluative character, such as the existence of special circumstances. What must appear from the reasons is why the discretion was exercised in the way it was. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 349">These principles have been confirmed in subsequent cases. For example, in Dranichnikov v Centrelink [5] the Full Federal Court held that special circumstances "....distinguish the case in consideration from the usual case. There will a requirement that the circumstance of such that takes the case out of the ordinary....", citing Jess v Scott [6] . The Federal Court has also more recently affirmed the approach that granting of special circumstances must be in accordance with the objectives of the legislation [7] . Where special circumstances are held to exist, the decision-maker should provide adequate information to ensure that it is clear which facts or circumstances are found to be "special"; why these circumstances should be treated as regarding some Commonwealth payments as not having been made; and the provision of some reasons or logic as to why a particular quantum (in whole or in part) is to be waived [8] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] AATA 240">In Secretary, Department of Employment &amp; Workplace Relations v Homewood [2006] FCA 779 ; (2006) 91 ALD 103 at [34] , French J explained how best to exercise the special circumstances discretion contained in section 1184K of the Act. He recommended three steps. Firstly, identify circumstances of the case which are 'special' and the reasons for arriving at that finding. Secondly, explain why it is appropriate to treat the whole or part of the compensation payment as not having been made. Then, explain the selection of the particular amount disregarded under the section. In accordance with this judgment, I have first considered whether Mr Senna's circumstances are special before further considering the discretion available to me. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] AATA 231">In Secretary, Department of Employment &amp; Workplace Relations v Homewood [2006] FCA 779 at [34] , French J explained how best to exercise the special circumstances discretion contained in section 1184K of the Act.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] AATA 85">Whether any particular set of circumstances attracts the epithet "special" is a question of fact (see Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Homewood [2006] FCA 779 ; (2006) 91 ALD 103 at 110). "Special circumstances" is used within income support law at various points in which to cushion or temper the exercise of a discretion relating to a power or liability in order to signify or demarcate a particular threshold of circumstances applicable to income support recipients where the adjudication of a decision must take place. "Special circumstances" is also deployed in debt waiver provisions such as section 1237AAD of the Social Security Act and section 101 of the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 (Cth) (compare Order 52 r 15(2) of the Federal Court Rules which uses the cognate expression "special reasons"). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] TASSC 99">
 91 The learned trial judge, having found that Yusuf 's case laid down the appropriate test, concluded that the tribunal had complied with its obligations. Counsel for the appellant submits that, even if Yusuf is the correct test, the tribunal did not give adequate reasons. In support of this contention he referred to a decision of the Federal Court of Australia in Secretary, Department of Employment &amp; Workplace Relations v Homewood [2006] FCA 779 where French J dealt with an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Western Australia. The tribunal was dealing with social security legislation. The obligation to give reasons was contained in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), s43 , which relevantly provided: 
 
 
 "43 ...
 (2) Subject to this section and to sections 35 and 36D , the Tribunal shall give reasons either orally or in writing for its decision. ... 
 
 
 (2B) Where the Tribunal gives in writing the reasons for its decision, those reasons shall include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based. "</sentence>

 1. Whether any particular set of circumstances attracts the epithet "special" is a question of fact (see Homewood [2006] FCA 779 at [35] ).
