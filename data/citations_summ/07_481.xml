<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 222">The principles to be applied in construing the claims have been reviewed extensively in a number of recent authorities ( Sachtler GmbH &amp; Co.

(1988) 13 IPR 385 at 400, the judgment of the Full Court in Insta Image Pty Ltd v K D Kanopy Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 139 ; (2008) 78 IPR 20 at [82] , the judgment of the Full Court in Kinabalu Investments Pty Ltd v Barron &amp; Rawson Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 178 at [44] and [45] and the judgment of the Full Court in PAC Mining Pty Ltd v Esco Corporation [2009] FCAFC 18 at [26] to [29]. As Lindgren J observed in Breville Pty Ltd v Warehouse Group (Australia) Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1893 ; (2006) 67 IPR 576 at [41] , the Court is frequently called upon to refer to the principles which govern the construction of claims and "on each new occasion it seems that the same authorities plus the last preceding one are reviewed. And so the list lengthens. " I propose to simply state the propositions to be applied derived from these authorities and some others in construing claim 13 of the patent in suit and any claim upon which it rests. </sentence>
