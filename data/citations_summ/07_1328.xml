<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1933">24 In Hayes, in the matter of Estate Property Group Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 935 , Gyles J took a slightly different approach from that which was adopted in the cases referred to above. His Honour made orders extending the convening period for up to 60 days but he reserved consideration of any application to further extend the period if a case were made out for such a further extension. His Honour said he would then exercise the power provided for by s 447A. (See also Hall, in the matter of Australian Capital Reserve Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 1328 at [1] ). The effect of the approach taken by Gyles J, if adopted in the present case, would be for an extension of time to be dealt with in stages and that is a matter I have considered carefully in considering the application that was made to me this morning. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1329">1 On 15 June 2007 I made orders extending the convening period for the meeting of creditors required to be held under s 439A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) to midnight 23 July 2007 in relation to a number of companies, being the members of what is known as the Estate Property Group (the Group), together with some ancillary orders on the application of the administrators of the companies in the Group (the Administrators) ( Hayes, in the matter of Estate Property Group Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 935). In a related application concerning Australian Capital Reserve Limited (Administrators Appointed) (ACR), on 12 June 2007 orders were made extending the "decision period" provided for by s 441A(1)(b) of the Act to the last day of the convening period for a number of companies in the Group ( Australian Capital Reserve Limited (Administrators Appointed) v High Tower Investments Pty Limited (Administrators Appointed); in the matter of High Tower Investments Pty Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 1028). On 13 July 2007 the convening period for the second meeting of creditors of those companies was further extended to midnight on 31 August 2007 utilising the provisions of s 447A(1) of the Act to achieve that result and certain ancillary orders were made. I indicated then that I would give reasons for those orders in due course. These are those reasons. These reasons should be read with those in Hall, in the matter of Australian Capital Reserve Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 1328 to be delivered contemporaneously. The background to these reasons is set out in the various judgments to which I have referred and need not be repeated.</sentence>
