<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 173">Generally an order for costs follows the event, and is to be taxed on a party/party basis. However, if the substantive issues have not been determined by the Court, it will usually make no order as to the costs of the proceeding as there has been no hearing on the merits: L &amp; A Maglio Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1365 at [22] - [24]. In Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 , McHugh J said at 625: 
 
 If it appears that both parties have acted reasonably in commencing and defending the proceedings and the conduct of the parties continued to be reasonable until the litigation was settled or its further prosecution became futile, the proper exercise of the cost discretion will usually mean that the court will make no order as to the cost of the proceedings.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1172">Generally an order for costs follows the event, and is to be taxed on a party/party basis. However, if the substantive issues have not been before the Court it will usually make no order as to the costs of the proceeding as there has been no hearing on the merits: L &amp; A Maglio Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1365 at [22] - [24]. In Gribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission (1997) 80 FCR 284 Finkelstein J emphasised at 287 that: 
 
 in the absence of a hearing on the merits it is difficult to see how any order, other than an order that each party bear its own costs, can be made except in special circumstances. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 485">Mr Vaughan for the Commissioner referred me to the case of Findlay v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1074 ( Findlay ) and to the case of L &amp; A Maglio Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1365 ; (2007) 67 ATR 302 ( Maglio ). Both of these cases demonstrate that in determining the question of costs in tax cases it is permissible for the Court to take into account the question of whether the successful taxpayer has conducted himself or herself in a way which has led to the commencement of litigation which could have been avoided or which has unnecessarily prolonged litigation. In Findlay , the successful taxpayer was deprived of his costs because of his conduct and in Maglio the successful taxpayer was deprived of part of its costs for the same reason. In my view, these cases are germane to the circumstances of this case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 35">L &amp; A Maglio Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1365 concerned taxation appeals by several taxpayers against appellable objection decisions. The appeals were compromised and were discontinued by consent, but the respondent sought costs of the appeals. Those costs were ordered in the respondent's favour, having regard to the appellants' conduct of the appeal over a lengthy period: see at [32]. The other decision referred to by counsel for the defendant is equally evidently inapplicable. Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 concerned the award of costs after the applicant's claim had been summarily dismissed. Costs were awarded on a solicitor and client basis against the applicant, having regard to the way the proceedings were conducted. In neither case was there the overlap of the application of O 23 of the Federal Court Rules . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1416">
 

51 Ordinarily where there has been no hearing on the merits and the parties no longer wish to proceed with the action, no orders as to costs will be made: L &amp; A Maglio Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1365 at [24] . This applies so long as the parties have continued to act reasonably in prosecuting or defending their application: Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 per McHugh J at 624- 625. </sentence>
