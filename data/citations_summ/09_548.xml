Moreover, an earlier offence of the CFMEU is no less an offence by that corporate body because it was committed by a division or branch other than the one responsible for the contravention presently under consideration. As Jessup J observed in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548 at [20], "the deterrent effect of a penalty would be significantly compromised if the court were obliged to turn a blind eye to a prior contravention merely because it occurred in a different division or branch of an organisation. " The CFMEU's deplorable record of contraventions of the BCII Act must rank as a significant consideration when fixing a penalty in the present proceedings.

(4) The effect of prior contravening conduct is more cogent if it has been the subject of conviction. If not, the prior conduct is still relevant but perhaps of less weight: McInerney , King CJ at 113 and Cox J at 124; Williams v CFMEU (No 2) [2009] FCA 548 ( Williams (No 2)) , Jessup J at [26]-[28]. (5) Whether previous misconduct is relevant to fixing a penalty is a question of logic: Temple at [63].

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 65">To require any person who might be interested in reading such a record to go from the order to a document found only on the relevant Court file would not fulfil any function at all. The function of recording the Court's findings, principally fulfilled by the Court's reasons for judgment, can also be fulfilled by specifying in an order relating to a penalty the conduct in respect of which the penalty has been imposed. See, for example, the orders made by Jessup J in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548. For these reasons, I decline to make the declarations sought by both parties. (Emphasis added). 75 First, that unlike the description adopted in other similar cases in which the CFMEU was a respondent, the trial judge had understated the CFMEU's position when he said that the CFMEU "cannot be treated as having first offender status for the purposes of this case" (at [23]): cf Draffin v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCAFC 120 ; (2009) 189 IR 145 at [92] and Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No. 2) [2009] FCA 548 ; (2009) 182 IR 327 at [29] . Secondly, the trial judge had inappropriately observed, without any evidentiary foundation, that the CFMEU would "have some difficulty adjusting to legislation that applies sanctions in an attempt to bring about a change to an entrenched culture": at [23].  
 

27 The question of prior contraventions was dealt with by his Honour in the following passage (at [23]):
 There were conflicting submissions by counsel for the parties about the extent to which I should take into account previous findings of contraventions of the BCII Act by the first respondent. The conflict concerned such matters as the relevance of contraventions of provisions of the BCII Act other than those directly in issue in the present case, and whether it was legitimate to take into account contraventions brought about by the activities of branches of the first respondent in states other than Victoria, which might be affected by the degree of autonomy under which branches function. These questions are now largely dealt with in the judgment of Jessup J in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548 , to which the parties referred me in writing by agreement after the close of argument in the present case. It is unnecessary to repeat what is said in that case. For present purposes, it is sufficient for me to say that I deal with the first respondent on the basis that it has a record of prior contraventions of the BCII Act and similar provisions, in circumstances having some similarities to those of the present case. It is not surprising that an organisation in the position of the first respondent will have some difficulty adjusting to legislation that applies sanctions in an attempt to bring about a change to an entrenched culture. It remains to be seen whether repeated imposition of penalties, and lapse of time, will bring about greater compliance. The first respondent cannot be treated as having first offender status for the purposes of this case. (Emphasis added) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 111"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1574">I have been referred to the penalties imposed in numerous cases. However many were pursuant to the WR Act which provided for significantly lower maximum penalties. The penalties which I have imposed are generally consistent with those imposed by Jessup J in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548. The conduct in that case was somewhat more serious than in this. However the penalties for individual breaches were reduced to reflect the overall extent of the misconduct. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 1003">In relation to general principles, recent Federal Court judgments do not exclude the Court from consideration of other contraventions of industrial law previously found against the union organisations and their constituent bodies, even where they concerned different provisions of legislation, different officials, different branches of the CFMEU, and contraventions and judgments occurring before and after the relevant contravention. The reasons for this were examined extensively by Jessup J in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548 ; (2009) 182 IR 327 , and his Honour explained the varying degrees of relevance and weight which might be given when assessing a previous record of contraventions. As his Honour said at [16]: "what is important, in my view, is the quality of the conduct in each case, and the relevance of the conduct to the norms of industrial behaviour which the instant legislation seeks to establish or support" . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 1119">To require any person who might be interested in reading such a record to go from the order to a document found only on the relevant Court file would not fulfil any function at all. The function of recording the Court's findings, principally fulfilled by the Court's reasons for judgment, can also be fulfilled by specifying in an order relating to a penalty the conduct in respect of which the penalty has been imposed. See, for example, the orders made by Jessup J in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 1040">Various other judicial statements have been made concerning the significance of a prior contravention in a different state or territory: see A &amp; L Silvestri v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466 at [13] and Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548 at [18] - [19] per Jessup J. Nothing to which I have been referred dissuades me from the view that, whilst prior contraventions in any state and territories may be relevant to fixing the penalty to be imposed on the Union, it will be for the Court in each case to consider the question of weight, having regard to all the relevant circumstances.  I agree with his Honour's observations: compare Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2 ) [2009] FCA 548 at [16] per Jessup J and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 173 IR 189 at 209 [64] per Dowsett J.  Much the same must also be said of Williams [2009] FCA 223 and Williams (No 2) [2009] FCA 548. Consideration of them is helpful, but ultimately the factors relevant to the imposition of penalties differ.  Further, on 13 March 2009, in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 223 , Jessup J found that, on 31 July 2006, Mr Mates and the Union had committed two breaches of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act by organising a stoppage of work on a building site and threatening to organise a further stoppage unless the employer engaged a labourer. On 28 May 2009, Jessup J dealt with the matter of penalties: see Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548. (With the consent of the applicant, the respondents advised me that this last-mentioned judgment was the subject of an appeal. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 865">It is fair to say that that approach has not been generally supported in the authorities. Rather than commence the assessment by determining an overall penalty and then distributing the amount of that penalty amongst the various contraventions either arithmetically or by reference to a weighted distribution, the better approach to the application of the totality principle involves an assessment of a penalty appropriate to each contravention and then a final overall assessment of the sum of the penalties to consider whether the aggregate is "just and appropriate". This approach is consistent with Mill v The Queen (supra) and has been applied by Goldberg J in ACCC v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd ; Jessup J in Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions; Jessup J in Williams v CFMEU (No. 2) [2009] FCA 548 and Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick (supra). The approach has been described by Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Johnson v R (supra) at [26] in these terms: 
 The joint judgment in Mill expresses a preference for what should be regarded as the orthodox, but not necessarily immutable, practice of fixing a sentence for each offence and aggregating them before taking the next step of determining concurrency. 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCA 787">There are three instances of similar previous conduct by the Union involving breaches of s 38 ; see Stuart-Mahoney, Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169 and Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 299. Although the relevant conduct in Temple , concerned breaches by the Western Australian Branch of the Union of s 38 of the Act, nevertheless the conduct is previous relevant conduct; see Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No. 2) [2009] FCA 548 per Jessup J at [22]---[25], see also Temple per Dowsett J at [63]. The second respondent has not engaged in any similar previous conduct. In contrast to the circumstances in Stuart-Mahoney, Temple and Duffy (No 2) , the respondents' conduct on 6 October 2006 was of limited duration and impact and penalties at the lower end of the scale are appropriate. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FCA 650">Such submissions are not novel. They have been rehearsed in a number of the authorities relied on by the CFMEU. These authorities have recently been reviewed by Jessup J in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548. </sentence>
