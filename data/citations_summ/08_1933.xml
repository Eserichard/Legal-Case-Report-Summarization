<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 447">In the circumstances, consistent with the authorities which include Mentha, in the matter of Hans Continental Smallgoods Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2008] FCA 1933 at [20] and given the attitude of the creditors to the issues I have identified, I consider that it is appropriate for the Court to grant the extension sought by the Administrators in order to maximise, and because those actions are directed towards maximising, the return for creditors and shareholders. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 344">The principles which apply to an application for an extension of time to convene and hold a second meeting of creditors are well settled. I referred to them in my decision in Mentha, in the matter of Hans Continental Smallgoods Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2008] FCA 1933 at [20] . It is unnecessary to repeat or refer in detail to the authorities which I there mentioned but, as I said, the principles were summed up by Barrett J in Re Diamond Press Australia Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 313 (" Diamond Press ") at [10]. As his Honour said: 
 
 The function of the court...is to strike an appropriate balance between...the expectation that administration will be a relatively speedy and summary matter...and the requirement that undue speed should not be allowed to prejudice sensible and constructive actions towards maximising the return for creditors and any return for shareholders. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 30">In order for the administrators to carry out their function properly, it is necessary that they should have sufficient time to investigate the affairs of the companies under administration and to provide sensible information and advice to the creditors: Hayes, in the matter of Estate Property Group Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 935 at [1] . That includes sufficient time to investigate and carry out a sale process in which structured 'due diligence' procedures are adopted: Re Diamond Press at [11], Re Hans Continental Smallgoods Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1933 at [21] . It also includes time to pursue a possible recapitalisation. In Re Chemeq Ltd; ex parte McMaster [2007] WASC 154 an extension of six months was allowed for this purpose. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] WASC 384">8 In a number of cases s 447A has been used as a basis for a further application to extend the convening period and to modify the operation of s 439A(2) so as to permit the second meeting of creditors to be held before the end of the convening period. Perhaps the clearest illustration of this point is the decision of Re Mentha; Hans Continental Smallgoods Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2008] FCA 1933. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 349">I also referred to the difficulties which arise in determining the period to permit the appropriate period for an extension in Mentha, in the matter of Hans Continental Small Goods Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2008] FCA 1933 at [23] - [25]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 70">
In Re Mentha; Hans Continental Smallgoods Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2008] FCA 1933 , hereafter Mentha , Jacobson J had occasion to reflect upon whether, in the circumstances of the case before him, an order of the kind made in Hayes' case ought to be made. In the result, his Honour came to grant an extension of up to 90 days, as had been sought by the administrators, rather than to adopt a form of order akin to that made in Hayes' case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 38">The authorities establish that, where an application is made under s 439A(6) for an extension of time, the Court must strike a balance between the expectation that the administration be conducted relatively speedily and summarily and the need to ensure that undue speed not prejudice sensible and constructive actions directed towards maximising the return for creditors and shareholders: see Mentha, In the matter of Hans Continental Smallgoods Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2008] FCA 1933 at [20] per Jacobson J and PCG Capital Management Limited, In the matter of PCG Capital Management Limited and Glen Brook Pty Limited [2008] FCA 508 at [16] per Emmett J. </sentence>
