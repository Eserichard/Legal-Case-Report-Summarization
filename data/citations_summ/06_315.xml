<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] TASSC 6">33 The applicant relied on a number of authorities which deal with the role of the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. Both Tribunals carry out "full merits reviews". The AAT stands in the shoes of the decision-maker and is not limited to a consideration of evidence that was before the original decision-maker; it decides the matter on the basis of material available to it at the time of the review; Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2008] HCA 31 ; (2008) 82 ALJR 1147 ; Comptroller-General Customs v Akai Pty Ltd (1994) 50 FCR 511 at 521; Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1979] AATA 179 ; (1979) 24 ALR 577 at 589. (It is doubtful though whether that tribunal has an obligation to seek out evidence; Pham v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 315. ) The Refugee Review Tribunal is in a similar position. It is an "inquisitorial" body, and one not in the position of a contradictor to the case advanced, the obligation in relation to which is on the applicant; Abebe v Commonwealth (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 576 [187]; Re Ruddock, Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437 at 450 [57] , 455 [81].</sentence>
