<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 504">Insofar as he raises this matter as a basis on which the court should decline to make a sequestration order, relevant to the exercise of discretion under s.52(2)(b) of the Act, the debtor must show that the claim is a genuine and serious one he has not reasonably been able to litigate and that it has " sufficient validity ... to justify a dismissal or adjournment of the petition " ( Re Schmidt; Ex parte Anglewood Pty Ltd (1968) 13 FLR 111 at 116). The prospects of success of such proceedings should be considered to the extent that is possible on the material before the court (see Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [2008] FCA 353 at [31] and Totev v Sfar and Another (2008) 167 FCR 193 ; [2008] FCAFC 35). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 1229">The principles generally applicable are not in dispute and were recently restated by the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [4] . In Cumins the Federal Court (albeit on an application to stay the creditor's petition, but there being no material difference in relevant principle) said: "14 On proof of the matters mentioned in s 52(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("the Act ") a petitioning creditor has a prima facie right to the making of a sequestration order and the Court will proceed to make a sequestration order unless the Court is satisfied that for other sufficient cause a sequestration order should not be made: s 52(2)(b) of the Act ; Cain v Whyte (1933) 48 CLR 639 at 646. The onus is on the respondent debtor to demonstrate "sufficient cause": Commissioner of Taxation v Bayeh [1999] FCA 1223 ; (1999) 100 FCR 144 at [12] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 1134">The respondent also correctly refers to a passage from McDonald, Henry and Meek, Australian Bankruptcy Law and Practice para.52.2.22 which states: "Where the debtor seeks to establish "any other cause" for exercising the Court's discretion to decline to make a sequestration order on the grounds of a claim against the creditor or someone else for an amount equal to or greater than the amounts the debtor owes the creditor, the debtor must show that the claim is a genuine and serious one which he or she has not reasonably been able to litigate (Re LHF Wools Ltd [1970] Ch 27) and that it is a "real claim" that is "likely to succeed", having "sufficient validity ... to justify a dismissal or adjournment of the petition": Re Schmidt; Ex parte Anglewood Pty Ltd (1968) 13 FLR 111 at 116. " 
Although not referred to by the respondent in his final summary argument document the learned authors went on to state: 
 
 "The mere existence of an "arguable claim", counter claim or appeal by the debtor does not, however by itself necessarily constitute "other sufficient cause" to dismiss the creditor's petition. ... In determining whether to exercise it's discretion under s.52(2)(b) , the Court "will ... consider the prospects of success of [the relevant] proceedings ... to the extent that this is capable of being done on the material before" the Court: Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [2008] FCA 353 at [31] (Gilmour J). "

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 794">73 The respondent further submits that even if it were to be accepted that he is presently facing an unshakeable claim of some $4.8 million in respect of the 1998 assessment, that figure raises very different issues in relation to possible payment or compromise of the claim than if he were to face the current $38 million claim in the bankruptcy notice. The figure of $4.8 million is, I infer, a reference to a finding made in an earlier decision that the total amount of the judgment debt which is not related to the AAT applications is in the order of $4.8 million: Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [2008] FCA 353 at [63] .  75 There was no argument before me as to the content of these submissions. I earlier refused to adjourn the hearing of this petition despite the currency of the respondent's two applications to the AAT. I was not then satisfied that the respondent had established genuine and arguable grounds in relation to either of his AAT applications: Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [2008] FCA 353. That position has not altered. The respondent's submissions on the exercise of discretion are predicated upon his being successful, on the merits, before the AAT. The likelihood of that occurring has not been established. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 407">6 It also annexes the respondent's summary of argument in respect of its application for special leave to the High Court of Australia as well as the applicant's summary of argument in response. The AAT matters and the special leave application to the High Court are the subject of my reasons for judgment delivered yesterday in Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [2008] FCA 353 and Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [No 2] [2008] FCA 354. Finally there are annexed copies of the motions for leave to appeal against my two interlocutory judgments delivered yesterday. As I have indicated already, no grounds are stated in either of the notices of motion. </sentence>
