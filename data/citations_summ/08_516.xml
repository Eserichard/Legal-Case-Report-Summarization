<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 689">At [67]-[68] their Honours proceeded to consider whether the treatment of Ms Zhang by the University in consequence of her behaviour, namely, the imposition of conditions on her continued study and ultimately the constructive termination of her candidature, was less favourable than would have been given to others who acted disruptively in the same way but did not have a psychological disability. They proceeded to refer to the paucity of evidence in that regard but noted the evidence of the relevant University personnel to the effect that they would have done the same thing with any other student in the same circumstances. There was no suggestion in any of the evidence to support an allegation that the University would in fact have treated another disruptive graduate student more favourably than it treated Ms Zhang. Their Honours then said at [68]:

Accordingly, it cannot be said in the circumstances that the trial judge was plainly wrong (and here it must be acknowledged the deference that is due to the trial judge in matters of fact, particularly where his Honour had the benefit of seeing the Appellant give evidence viva voce and assessing her demeanour ...

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 35">1 The principal issue in this appeal concerns an allegation by the appellant of discrimination against her on the ground of an imputed disability, in contravention of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) ("the Disability Discrimination Act "). The appeal is from a judgment of a single judge of the Court, published as Zhang v University of Tasmania [2008] FCA 516. His Honour dismissed with costs an application filed by the appellant under s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth), claiming compensation for unlawful discrimination under the Disability Discrimination Act , as well as under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth). 66 The first step is to consider the behaviour in question. It was not challenged below or on appeal that the Appellant's behaviour (eg slamming papers, crying, shouting, and arguing) was considered by UTAS to be disruptive. For example, Dr Hanson gave evidence that the Appellant was "antagonising everyone she came into contact with at [UTAS], not just University academic or administrative staff but student association people as well": Zhang v University of Tasmania [2008] FCA 516 , [45]. Not only did the trial judge accept Dr Hanson's evidence, he noted: "Having seen [the Appellant] giving evidence, Dr Hanson's assessment does not come as a surprise to me. Ms Ormandy gave evidence that at a student function [the Appellant] was upset and distressed and threw a plate of food at her": Zhang v University of Tasmania [2008] FCA 516 , [46]. The relevant comparator is therefore another PhD candidate manifesting disruptive behaviour to the extent that there was a worsening of relations between her and other university members generally and eventually a breakdown of relations with her supervisor. 63 In the circumstances of this case, however, we do not think it is necessary to resolve either this issue or the issue of whether the 8 November letter amounted to constructive termination of the Appellant's PhD candidature. Instead, assuming without deciding that:
 
1. the suggestion that the Appellant attend counselling and that she suffered from "potentially serious psychological problems" constituted an imputation of a psychological disorder within the meaning of the DDA (contrary to the finding of the trial judge: Zhang v University of Tasmania [2008] FCA 516 , [44]---[50]); and 
 
2. the letter of 8 November 1999 amounted to the subjection of the Appellant to 'any other detriment' within the meaning of s 22(2)(c) of the DDA because it provided no meaningful alternative for her to continue her studies at UTAS, whether or not the letter constituted 'constructive termination' of her PhD candidature (again contrary to the finding of the trial judge: Zhang v University of Tasmania [2008] FCA 516 , [3], [51]);
 
the Appellant's discrimination claim would still fail because it cannot be said that UTAS would have treated a person without the Appellant's "disability" any differently. The reason is that the relevant comparator is a person displaying the same behaviour as the Appellant but without the disability, not a person without the disability and without the behaviour.  33 This is an appeal against an order dismissing the Appellant's application under s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) ("the HREOC Act "): Zhang v University of Tasmania [2008] FCA 516.  66 The first step is to consider the behaviour in question. It was not challenged below or on appeal that the Appellant's behaviour (eg slamming papers, crying, shouting, and arguing) was considered by UTAS to be disruptive. For example, Dr Hanson gave evidence that the Appellant was "antagonising everyone she came into contact with at [UTAS], not just University academic or administrative staff but student association people as well": Zhang v University of Tasmania [2008] FCA 516 , [45]. Not only did the trial judge accept Dr Hanson's evidence, he noted: "Having seen [the Appellant] giving evidence, Dr Hanson's assessment does not come as a surprise to me. Ms Ormandy gave evidence that at a student function [the Appellant] was upset and distressed and threw a plate of food at her": Zhang v University of Tasmania [2008] FCA 516 , [46]. The relevant comparator is therefore another PhD candidate manifesting disruptive behaviour to the extent that there was a worsening of relations between her and other university members generally and eventually a breakdown of relations with her supervisor. 62 On the other hand, UTAS had responsibilities to the staff and to the Appellant. In evaluating the conduct of UTAS, these responsibilities cannot be ignored. Professor Denholm's sworn evidence was that he proposed the conditions because he was trying to find a way for the Appellant to continue her studies at UTAS if that was what she wanted. Professor Denholm considered that the ongoing disputation by the Appellant about the issues addressed by those conditions would make it almost impossible for the Appellant to continue her studies within UTAS and he was trying to prevent that from happening. In other words, the Respondents contended, and the trial judge accepted ( Zhang v University of Tasmania [2008] FCA 516 , [50]) that the conduct complained of should not be found to constitute an imputation of a psychological disability because it was undertaken with beneficent intent. 68 In the absence of such evidence, the Court is left only with evidence of the relevant university personnel to the effect that they would have done the same thing with any other student in the same circumstances. It may be accepted that this evidence was less than wholly satisfactory. However, although the Appellant challenged UTAS's evidence as both self-serving and non-specific, the fact remains that it was not impeached by her either in cross-examination or by positive evidence of her own. In short, there is no suggestion in any of the evidence to support an allegation that UTAS would in fact have treated another disruptive graduate student more favourably than the Appellant. Accordingly, it cannot be said in the circumstances that the trial judge was plainly wrong (and here it must be acknowledged the deference that is due to the trial judge in matters of fact, particularly where his Honour had the benefit of seeing the Appellant give evidence viva voce and assessing her demeanour, as noted: Warren v Coombes [1979] HCA 9 ; (1978) 142 CLR 531 , 551; Annand &amp; Thompson Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1979] FCA 36 ; (1979) 25 ALR 91 , 97, 110; Devries v Australian National Railways Commission (1993) 177 CLR 472 , 479---83; SS Hontestroom v SS Sagaporack [1927] AC 37 , 47) in accepting UTAS's evidence, which his Honour did implicitly in finding that there was no factual basis for a finding of discrimination: Zhang v University of Tasmania [2008] FCA 516 , [3], [52]. </sentence>
