<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 66">In Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) [11] the Federal Court considered the meaning of "false and misleading" in what was then s.298SC(c) of the WR Act and observed as follows: 288 Whilst the wording of s 298SC is not identical to that employed in s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), there is a sufficient correspondence between the two to enable a conclusion to be drawn that it is unnecessary to establish an intent on the part of the alleged contravener to make a false or misleading misrepresentation (see Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Limited v Sydney Building Information Centre Limited [1978] HCA 11 ; [1978] HCA 11 ; (1978) 140 CLR 216 at 228 and Brown v Jam Factory Pty Limited [1981] FCA 35 ; (1981) 53 FLR 340 at 349). It must be acknowledged that the word 'false', when viewed in isolation, is a latently ambiguous one (see per Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Murphy v Farmer ('Murphy') [1988] HCA 31 ; (1988) 165 CLR 19 at 26). 'False' is not a precise adjective (per Brennan and Toohey JJ in Murphy at 22).</sentence>

Reliance is placed on Inspector Cruse v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1267 ; (2008) 175 IR 447 (the substantive proceeding) and Cruse v CFMEU (No 2) [2008] FCA 1637 (the penalty proceeding) as an example of contraventions of ss 298SC and 170NC of the Act by the CFMEU. The Union was vicariously liable for the conduct of its delegate, Mr Fry. The conduct involved Mr Fry falsely telling a self-employed building contractor engaged to do work on a building site that he was required to join the CFMEU (the s 298SC breach) and falsely telling the contractor that he was required to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement (the s 170NC breach). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 355">In Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No.3) (2007) FCA 87 (" Hadgkiss ") Graham J considered the meaning of false and misleading in what was section 298SC of WR Act. At paragraph 288 His Honour said: "False can mean merely 'untrue' or 'wrong' or it can involve both subjective and objective elements and mean 'purposely untrue'... In the context in which it is used, I am satisfied that 'false' means no more than erroneous in fact. Similarly, no element of intent is required under s298SC before a representation that are misleading. Section 298SC proscribes the making of representations which are false in the sense of being untrue and, what might be thought to be a lesser form of transgression, representation can be found to have been misleading. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCAFC 17">This appeal represents the culmination, in this Court, of a series of proceedings arising from events which occurred in the Illawarra region of New South Wales in January and February 2004. The judgments which are most directly relevant to an understanding of those events and the litigation which ensued are: Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) [2007] FCA 87 (the "principal judgment" where the trial judge concluded that the present appellants each contravened s 298SC(c) of the WR Act), Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 4) [2007] FCA 425 (the "relief judgment" where the primary judge made each of the orders which remain for consideration in the present appeal, as well as other orders), Hadgkiss v CFMEU [2008] FCAFC 22 (where a Full Court allowed an appeal by the present respondent in part and remitted some matters for further consideration by the primary judge) and Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 5) [2008] FCA 1040 (where the primary judge considered the matters remitted to him and imposed some further penalties but not ones which require consideration in the present appeal). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1040"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 466">9 The relevance of that question is emphasised by noting the facts found in relation to his activities in relation to another site in the Wollongong area not long after these events ( Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) [2007] FCA 87 , (2007) 160 IR 263 ; Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 4) [2007] FCA 425 , (2007) 161 IR 338 ; Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCAFC 22). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCAFC 22">51 This appeal is one of two against a judgment of a judge of this Court in Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) [2007] FCA 87. In that judgment the primary judge found that each respondent had contravened the provisions of s 298SC(c) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the Act') as in force in January and February 2004. The present appeal is by the applicant at first instance who was an inspector appointed under s 84 of the Act to whom the Employment Advocate (referred to in Part IVA of the Act) had delegated certain powers and functions including the power to make the application. The other appeal was brought by the respondents at first instance (now the respondents to the present appeal) who appealed against certain findings in the judgment and also against penalties imposed and other orders later made by the primary judge ( Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 4) [2007] FCA 425). Because the present appeal raised the possibility that, if the appellant succeeds on some of its arguments, it may be necessary to remit issues to the primary judge for further attention and as that might possibly affect the penalties imposed, the second appeal was adjourned pending the outcome of the present appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1047">74 There are some questions as to the proper construction of the section. It is contended for the respondents that intention to make a false and misleading representation is a necessary element of the offence. There is no direct authority in favour of that proposition. It is submitted that the reasoning in relation to other sections included in Pt 10A would be applicable (cf BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2000] FCA 430 ; (2000) 102 FCR 97 at [77] ; Australian Workers' Union v BHP Iron-Ore Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 3 ; (2001) 106 FCR 482 at [70] ---[78]). Indeed, such authority as exists is against the proposition contended for by the respondents ( Hadgkiss v Sunland Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 346 at [31] ---[34]; Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) (2007) 160 IR 263 , [2007] FCA 87 at [288] ---[289]; see also Riley McKay Pty Ltd v Bannerman (1977) 15 ALR 561 ; (1977) 31 FLR 129 per Bowen CJ at 134; Given v CV Holland (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1977) 15 ALR 439 ; (1977) 29 FLR 212). The presence of s 4(7) also tends against it. There is also a question as to whether the section only applies where the false or misleading representation about another's obligation to join an industrial association must be made to that other person. Graham J was of the opinion that the section was not so limited ( Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) (2007) 160 IR 263 ; [2007] FCA 87 at [287] ---[291]). Although not raised here, there may also be a question as to the meaning of "obligation" --- does it refer to legal obligation or practical obligation?  74 There are some questions as to the proper construction of the section.
