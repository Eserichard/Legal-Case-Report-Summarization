<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 456">Whilst the simpler and cheaper approach would be to allow DKSH to recover only part of its costs to reflect Bodum's right to set off the costs of the failed defences based upon delay and estoppel, I have no proper basis to make such an order: see Hansen Beverage Company v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 601. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 920">SBriggs contends that while a successful litigant is ordinarily entitled to an award of costs on the footing that costs follow the event ( Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72) , the ordinary application of the rule may well lead to an order for costs according to each party's success on the claim in relation to which costs were incurred ( Hansen Beverage Company v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2008] FCA 601) and a successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered to pay the other party's costs of them: Ruddock v Vadarlis (No. 2) . Thus, costs, it is said, should be allocated according to each party's success on their respective claims or alternatively in relation to issues arising in particular claims. An allocation of costs according to issues is said to be particularly appropriate in complex commercial litigation and particularly in patent suits: Stena Rederi Aktiebolag v Austal Ships Sales Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1141. This approach is said to be particularly important in intellectual property cases: Windsurfing International Inc. v Petit (1987) AIPC 90-441 ; Doric Products Pty Ltd v Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 282 ; Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCAFC 172 ; and JVMB Enterprises Pty Ltd v Camoflag Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCAFC 6. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] WASCA 126">297 Middleton J in Hansen Beverage Co v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd [No 2] [2008] FCA 601 took a contrary position. Order 62 r 24 of the Federal Court Rules materially provides that where a party to any proceedings serves a notice disputing a fact and afterwards that fact is proved in the proceedings he shall, unless the court otherwise orders, pay the costs of proof. Middleton J concluded, without discussion, that a fact was proved in proceedings if evidence of the fact was admitted into evidence [20].</sentence>
