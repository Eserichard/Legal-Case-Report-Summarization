<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] AATA 407">The total picture of a relationship must be considered, bearing in mind those factors which weigh against a marriage-like relationship and those which weigh in favour of it, and no one factor will be determinative: Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] AATA 404">Four of these five factors noted in the section list further and more specific matters to which a decision maker must have regard. It is not an exhaustive list. A decision maker can go further and wider, and must consider the total picture of the relationship that emerges from these factors, and which of them weigh against a marriage like relationship and which weigh in favour of it. Financial cooperation, cohabitation, a sexual relationship, cooperative household arrangements or mutual commitment, occurring alone, do not disclose, solely, a marriage like relationship. ( Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR. 546) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] AATA 351">The operation and interplay of these factors were considered in the Federal Court decision of Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546. French J (as he then was) described the task of assessing any relationship as requiring the decision-maker to have regard to their interpersonal relationship as a whole, not limited by the factors listed in s 4(3) but taking into account each of the matters identified by the statute. Section 4(3) contains several sub-headings, which give further reference points which a decision-maker should consider so that an overall picture of the relationship emerges. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] WASCA 78">46 In Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 , French J (as his Honour then was) had cause to consider the term 'marriage-like' appearing in s 4(2) of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth). His Honour observed (556):
 
 The judgment to be made is difficult and, once out of the range of obvious cases falling within the core concept of 'marriage-like', will be attended by a degree of uncertainty. Indeed, it may be that different decision-makers on the same facts could quite reasonably come up with different answers. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] AATA 1045">The matters listed in s 4(3) of the SS Act are not exhaustive, since the decision-maker's obligation under that section is "to have regard to all the circumstances of the relationship including in particular the (enumerated) matters. " I refer to the discussion at [6.56] to [6.60] in D.C. Pearce and R.S. Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia , (6 th Edition, 2006) in relation to the meaning of the word "includes" in this context. It is clear that the decision-maker is required to assess the totality of the evidence and other available material in order to decide whether an applicant for a pension is a member of a couple, taking into account that the personal circumstances of people vary substantially: see Staunton-Smith v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1991] FCA 513 ; (1991) 32 FCR 164 at 170; Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] AATA 959">In reviewing the indicia in s 4(3) of the Act, I am mindful to consider the totality of the relationship and the weight to be accorded to each of the factors. As noted by Fitzgerald J in Lynam, "each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements". The evidence in relation to s 4(3)(a) to (d) of the Act is relevant to and informed by the evidence in respect of the matters in s 4(3)(e). It is not a case of simply listing the factors for and against and deciding in favour of the majority. The indicia in s 4(3) of the Act are intended to capture the essence of a marriage-like relationship but it is the overall impression of the relationship, when considering all of those factors, which will lead a decision-maker to a conclusion. It is 'art' rather than 'science. ' As French J stated in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 at [47] : 
 The judgment to be made is difficult and, once out of the range of obvious cases falling within the core concept of "marriage like", will be attended by a degree of uncertainty. Indeed, it may be that different decision-makers on the same facts could quite reasonably come up with different answers.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] AATA 898">French J in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 dealt with ss 4(2) and 4 (3) of the Act in the context of an application for a carer payment. He referred to the decision in Staunton-Smith and to the decision of Fitzgerald J in Lynam v Director-General of Social Security (1983) 52 ALR 128. He stated that in determining whether a marriage-like relationship exists under the Act, the nature of the exercise is much the same as that required under the statutory formula used in Lynam and Staunton-Smith . In Lynam , Fitzgerald J said, at 131: 
 
 Each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which may point in one direction and some in the other. What must be looked at is the composite picture. Any attempt to isolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. The endless scope for differences in human attitudes and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration. In any particular case, it will be a question of fact and degree, a jury question, whether a relationship between two unrelated persons of the opposite sex meets the statutory test.

The criteria in sub-section 4(3) of the Act must be considered in deciding whether or not Mr Brimson and Ms Bryen have been living separately. It is noted, however, that the list of criteria in section 4(3) is not exhaustive and the Tribunal must have regard to the circumstances of the case: Staunton-Smith v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1991] FCA 513 ; (1991) 25 ALD 27 and Pelka v Secretary Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 . </sentence>

 BACKGROUND 
 This is an application for a review of a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal ("SSAT") made on 17 October 2008. The SSAT affirmed the decision of the Respondent to cancel the Applicant's age pension and raise and recover an overpayment of $57,974.20 of age pension for the period 21 November 2002 to 15 January 2008. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2010] AATA 284">The matters listed in s 4(3) of the Act are not exhaustive, since the decision-maker's obligation under that section is "to have regard to all the circumstances of the relationship including, in particular, the [enumerated] matters". It is clear from the authorities that the decision-maker is required to assess the totality of the evidence and other available material in order to decide whether a person is a member of a couple, taking into account that the personal circumstances of people vary substantially: see Staunton-Smith v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1991] FCA 513 ; (1991) 32 FCR 164 at 170; Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2010] FMCAfam 280">The importance of a consideration of the social security rule, its interpretation, and the attendant critical literature, is that it demonstrates: first, that there is a degree of uncertainty in the legislation, which has resulted in a number of amendments of the Social Security Act ; and secondly, it is apparent that the context of the legislation is of significant impact in interpreting the provisions. In this respect, it is important to note that the Social Security Act provides for financial support for those in society in need, in contrast to legislation such as the Family Law Act , and in particular the Status of Children Act in Victoria, which regulate the parentage and property rights of parties who enter into relationships. The words of s.4AA, making it clear that not every factor is necessarily required to be considered, indicate that the legislature moved away from the very structured approach suggested by French J (as his Honour then was) in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family &amp; Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 ; (2006) 43 AAR 220 with respect to the Social Security Act . Similarly, the legislature's use of a definition section different to that utilised in the Social Security Act indicates that the two definitions are intended to be different, although both assess similar situations. As a result, it is likely that there will be differences in the relationships covered by the term 'de facto' as it appears in various enactments, as a result not only of differences in wording, but the different purposes of the statutory schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2010] AATA 179">The real difficulty arises from the fact that, in the payment of various classes of benefit, there is a distinction drawn between married and unmarried people. So long as marriage is a basis for different levels of benefit there will be a policy imperative to apply the distinction to marriage-like relationships.

<sentence id="cs18" from="[2010] AATA 172">TOTAL PICTURE: Reference was made to the decision of Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2] where French J said: 
"Having regard to the current provisions of s 4(3) and the approaches discussed in the earlier authorities mentioned, a decision-maker concerned with whether an unmarried person is in a marriage-like relationship with another person of the opposite sex:
 
must specifically consider the total picture of the relationship created by all of these factors bearing in mind that consideration must be given to those which weigh against a marriage-like relationship and those that weigh in favour of it. "

Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia , (6 th Edition, 2006) in relation to the meaning of the word "includes" in this context. It is clear that the decision-maker is required to assess the totality of the evidence and other available material in order to decide whether an applicant for a pension is a member of a couple, taking into account that the personal circumstances of people vary substantially: see Staunton-Smith v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1991] FCA 513 ; (1991) 32 FCR 164 at 170; Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546. </sentence>

He referred to Staunton-Smith and Lynam v Director-General of Social Security (1983) 52 ALR 128. French J stated that, in determining whether a marriage-like relationship exists under the Act, the nature of the exercise is much the same as that required under the statutory formula used in Lynam and Staunton-Smith . In Lynam , Fitzgerald J said, at 131: 
 
 ...Each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which may point in one direction and some in the other. What must be looked at is the composite picture. Any attempt to isolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. The endless scope for differences in human attitudes and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration.

 BACKGROUND 
 This is an application for a review of a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal ("SSAT") made on 20 June 2008 that the Applicant be paid youth allowance at the partnered rate from 2 June 2008.  In Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 at 555-6, [46] French J, summarised the approach required of the Tribunal when considering whether two persons were in a marriage-like relationship in the following terms: 
" Having regard to the current provisions of s 4(3) and the approaches discussed in the earlier authorities mentioned, a decision-maker concerned with whether an unmarried person is in a marriage-like relationship with another person of the opposite sex: 
 
 (1) Must have regard to their interpersonal relationship as a whole not limited by the factors listed in s 4(3). 
 
 (2) Must have regard to each of: 
 
 (a) the financial aspects of the relationship; 
 
 (b) the nature of the household; 
 
 (c) the social aspects of the relationship; 
 
 (d) any sexual relationship between the people; and 
 
 (e) the nature of the people's commitment to each other. 
 
 (3) In having regard to the preceding five matters, must have regard to all factors relevant to each and, in particular, must have regard to the factors listed under each heading in s 4(3). 
 
 (4) Must specifically consider the total picture of the relationship created by all of these factors bearing in mind that consideration must be given to those which weigh against a marriage-like relationship and those which weigh in favour of it. 
 
 (5) Must undertake the preceding consideration bearing in mind that a marriage-like relationship is not disclosed solely by any one of the following matters: 
 
 (a) financial cooperation; 
 
 (b) cohabitation; 
 
 (c) a sexual relationship; 
 
 (d) cooperative household arrangements; or

 ANALYSIS 
 In Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 French J, after considering various authorities relating to former statutory provisions corresponding to s 4(2) and s 4(3) of the Act, said (at 555-556): 
 
 "Having regard to the current provisions of s 4(3) and the approaches discussed in the earlier authorities mentioned, a decision-maker concerned with whether an unmarried person is in a marriage-like relationship with another person of the opposite sex:

Accordingly, it is necessary for the Tribunal appropriately to weigh those competing considerations against each other in order to make a determination on the question whether the applicant has, at all material times, been living separately and apart from Kikuko Pala on a permanent or indefinite basis: Staunton-Smith v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1991] FCA 513 ; (1991) 32 FCR 164 at 170, 176-177; Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 at 555-556, 559. </sentence>

 ANALYSIS 
 
 Did the applicant have a "marriage-like relationship" with Mr B in the relevant period? 
 
 Approach to the question 
 In Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 (which also concerned the question whether a person was in a "marriage-like relationship" within the meaning of s 4(2)(b)(iii) and s 4(3) of the Act) French J said (at 553---556): 
 " ... 
 Marriage-like relationships 
 Social security legislation has long been concerned to differentiate the rate of benefits payable between those who are single and those who enjoy the benefits of marriage or like relationships. Such distinctions were made in the Social Services Act 1947 (Cth) which preceded the Act. 
 An example of an earlier statutory formula giving effect to such a distinction was considered by the Full Federal Court in Lambe v Director-General of Social Services [1981] FCA 171 ; (1981) 57 FLR 262.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs33" from="[2009] AATA 12">The concept of a "marriage-like relationship" under the Act was discussed in Re SRWW and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2001] AATA 495 , where the Tribunal noted that each matter is to be considered on its merits and that the Tribunal should remain flexible in its approach. The 'list' in s 4 is not exhaustive and no guidance is given as to the weight of any factor. They are common-sense indicators: Cullinane and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2004] AATA 789. The total picture of the relationship that emerges from the factors must be weighed: Re Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services and WAP [2000] AATA 7 (" WAP "). One factor alone will not be determinative of a marriage like relationship: P elka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs34" from="[2008] AATA 907">There are a number of Tribunal decisions on the application of the marriage-like relationship provisions. However, in considering this application I am conscious of the importance of having regard to the terms of s 4(2) and s 4(3) of the Act. The Federal Court of Australia has recently remarked that "the actual words of the legislation should provide the primary point of reference". [2] This accords with the observations of French J in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family Community Services [3] that it would "be multiplying discussion of various factual situations to canvass their decisions". [4]  I do not consider that there is any "significant pooling of financial resources" in the terms of s 4(3)(a)(ii) of the Act. I have been guided by the observations of French J in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family Community Services [11] that the ordinary dictionary meaning of the word "pool" is to put resources into a common stock or fund". [12] His Honour thought that pooling "plainly involves something more than financial cooperation or separate contributions to different elements of household expense". [13] I also mention that the Act requires me to consider whether pooling applies "especially in relation to major financial commitments". In my view there is no such major financial commitment which comes within the spirit of the Act.  I do not consider that there is any "significant pooling of financial resources" in the terms of s 4(3)(a)(ii) of the Act. I have been guided by the observations of French J in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family Community Services [11] that the ordinary dictionary meaning of the word "pool" is to put resources into a common stock or fund". [12] His Honour thought that pooling "plainly involves something more than financial cooperation or separate contributions to different elements of household expense". [13] I also mention that the Act requires me to consider whether pooling applies "especially in relation to major financial commitments". In my view there is no such major financial commitment which comes within the spirit of the Act.  There is evidence before me that Mr Hardie pays monthly repayments of $1,320 per month in respect of a mortgage over Ms Fleming's home. [5] This is important to consider in evaluating the financial aspects of the relationship between the parties as also is the fact that Mr Hardie paid for the applicant to complete a Real Estate Training Course. [6] I consider that these payments are of significance in indicating the existence of a marriage-like relationship between Ms Fleming and Mr Hardie.  I am also, under s 4(3)(a)(iv) , of the Act required to consider "the basis of any sharing of day-to-day household expenses". There is evidence before me that Ms Fleming and Mr Hardie do in fact share the household expenses. Ms Fleming pays the electricity and home telephone. Mr Hardie does assist in the payment of some bills if he has "money left over". [14] Ms Fleming informed the Social Security Appeals Tribunal that Mr Hardie will pay for groceries. There is in my view evidence that there is the "sharing of day-to-day household expenses". I regard this sharing of day-to-day household expenses to be of significance in indicating the existence of a marriage-like relationship between Ms Fleming and Mr Hardie.

I also note the statement by French J in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 in which he observes that social security legislation has long been concerned to differentiate the rates of benefit payable to those who are single and those who enjoy the benefits of marriage or like relationships. </sentence>

 In Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 French J, after considering various authorities relating to former statutory provisions corresponding to s 4(2) and s 4(3) of the SS Act, said (at 555-556): 
 "Having regard to the current provisions of s 4(3) and the approaches discussed in the earlier authorities mentioned, a decision-maker concerned with whether an unmarried person is in a marriage-like relationship with another person of the opposite sex: 
 
 (1) Must have regard to their interpersonal relationship as a whole not limited by the factors listed in s 4(3). 
 
 (2) Must have regard to each of: 
 
 (a) the financial aspects of the relationship; 
 
 (b) the nature of the household; 
 
 (c) the social aspects of the relationship; 
 
 (d) any sexual relationship between the people; and 
 
 (e) the nature of the people's commitment to each other. 
 
 (3) In having regard to the preceding five matters, must have regard to all factors relevant to each and, in particular, must have regard to the factors listed under each heading in s 4(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs37" from="[2008] AATA 677">The matters listed in s 4(3) of the Act are not exhaustive, since the decision-maker's obligation under that section "is to have regard to all the circumstances of the relationship including, in particular, the [enumerated] matters". The Tribunal notes the discussion at [6.56] to [6.60] in DC Pearce and RS Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, (6 th Edition, 2006) in relation to the meaning of the word "includes" in this context. It is clear that the decision-maker is required to assess the totality of the evidence and other available material in order to decide whether applicants for a pension are members of a couple, taking into account that the personal circumstances of people varies substantially: see Staunton-Smith v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1991] FCA 513 ; (1991) 25 ALD 27 ; Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546. It is nevertheless necessary to "have regard to" the relevant matters, and this expression has been interpreted to entail a requirement to take the relevant matters into account and give weight to them as a fundamental element in the decision-making process: R v Toohey; Ex Parte Meneling Station Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 69 ; (1982) 158 CLR 327 at 333. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs38" from="[2008] AATA 714">I accept the arrangement directing money through Mrs Steward's account was effecting separate contributions to different elements of household expenses and not pooling. It was cooperation which as French J. observed in Pelka [22] does not take a relationship on its own very far down the path towards characterising a marriage. Indeed, if, as Mr and Mrs Steward have observed in the past, this was a payment of board on Mr Steward's part, it would have been paid this way, that is, to her.  This does not make Pelka irrelevant to the task at hand, because assessing the nature of relationships requires balancing a number of factors relevant to determining the nature of relationships. Acknowledging the different expression in the two Acts suggests that the test to be applied in the case of persons who, as here, are legally married, is more closely aligned to that set out in decisions such as Staunton-Smith v Secretary, Department of Social Security [8] . In that regard, the analysis will always entail considering and weighing up several aspects of what goes to making a marriage and what distinguishes a marriage relationship from others, such as relationships of friendship, companions, carers, or flatmates. In Staunton-Smith the following was said [9] : 
 The responsibility of the fact-finding Tribunal is to have regard to all the material facts of each case, treating the matters listed above only as indicators. The parties referred me to the Federal Court decision of Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [6] as providing a reference point for the task of assessing whether a person is a member of a couple. French J described the task of assessing a relationship as requiring the decision-maker to [7] : 
 1. ... have regard to their interpersonal relationship as a whole not limited by the factors listed in s 4(3). 
 
 2. ... have regard to each of: 
 
 (a) the financial aspects of the relationship; 
 (b) the nature of the household; 
 (c) the social aspects of the relationship; 
 (d) any sexual relationship between the people; and 
 (e) the nature of the people's commitment to each other.... 
 
  From the oral evidence it seems that Mrs Steward is the beneficiary of Mr Steward's will, which, he said, was drawn up when he was a serviceman in the 1970's. However, as noted above, Mrs Steward drew up a new will in 1998 in which Mr Steward is not a beneficiary of her estate [23] . The evidence did not indicate that she was claiming for him as her dependant for tax matters. However the parties did take out a joint account, however briefly, in order to secure finances for their new home (Dartmoor St) in 2006. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs39" from="[2008] AATA 632">About March 2003, however, an unidentified informant had telephoned Centrelink, providing the information that the applicant and her husband had lived together for five years at Camira and, having recently moved, were living together at Bundamba. The informant's remarks, recorded on the Centrelink "Tip-Off Recording System" [5] , were to the effect that the applicant and her husband openly boasted that they were obtaining Centrelink benefits in order "to get ahead".  The matters addressed in s 4(3) , and the statutory framework for determining the nature of relationships were examined by the Federal Court in the decision of Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services . French J described the task of assessing a relationship as requiring the decision-maker to [4] : 
 1. ... have regard to their interpersonal relationship as a whole not limited by the factors listed in s4(3). 
 
 2. ... have regard to each of: 
 
 (a) the financial aspects of the relationship; 
 (b) the nature of the household; 
 (c) the social aspects of the relationship; 
 (d) any sexual relationship between the people;

<sentence id="cs40" from="[2008] AATA 522">French J in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 dealt with ss 4(2) and 4 (3) of the Act in the context of an application for a carer payment. He referred to the decision in Staunton-Smith and also to the decision of Fitzgerald J in Lynam v Director-General of Social Security (1983) 1 AAR 197 and stated that in determining whether a marriage-like relationship exists under the Act, the nature of the exercise is much the same as that required under the statutory formula used in Lynam and Staunton-Smith . In Lynam , Fitzgerald J said, at 200: 
 Each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which may point in one direction and some in the other. What must be looked at is the composite picture. Any attempt to isolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. The endless scope for differences in human attitudes and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration. In any particular case, it will be a question of fact and degree, a jury question, whether a relationship between two unrelated persons of the opposite sex meets the statutory test.

<sentence id="cs41" from="[2007] AATA 1398">Under the Social Security Act 1991 the rate of parenting payment that is payable to a person who satisfies the qualification requirements for that payment [9] is to be calculated using the rate calculator at s.1068A if the person is not a member of a couple, or the rate calculator at s.1068B if the person is a member of a couple [10] . The term 'member of a couple' is given meaning by subs 4(2)-(6A) inclusive. Relevantly, a person is a member of a couple if the person is legally married and is not living separately and apart from their husband or wife on a permanent or indefinite basis [11] . When determining whether or not a person is a member of a couple it is necessary to consider all of the circumstances of the relationship, including all of the matters set out at subs 4(3) concerning financial, domestic, social, sexual and other characteristics: Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services (2006) [12] . What must be considered, on all of the evidence, is the composite picture of the relationship: Lambe v Director-General of Social Services (1981) [13] . It is unlikely that a single factor, alone, will be determinative: Staunton-Smith v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1991) [14] . Each factor must be considered in the context of the evidence as a whole and the relationship thus revealed, and a determination made whether the married persons are living separately and apart on a permanent and indefinite basis. These are matters on which reasonable minds may differ on the same facts.

Accordingly, it is necessary for the Tribunal appropriately to weigh those competing considerations against each other in order to make a determination on the question whether Mr Mlynarczyk has, at all material times, been living separately and apart from Ms Mlynarczyk on a permanent or indefinite basis: Staunton-Smith v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1991] FCA 513 ; (1991) 32 FCR 164 as 176-177; Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 at 555-556, 559. </sentence>

 BACKGROUND 
 This is an application by the Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations ("the Applicant") for a review of a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal ("SSAT") made on 24 January 2006 in relation to the recovery of newstart allowance made to Mr Graham Inkster and Ms Caterina Ielasi ("the Respondents"). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs50" from="[2007] AATA 1986">The matters listed in s 4(3) of the SS Act are not exhaustive, since the decision-maker's obligation under that section is "to have regard to all the circumstances of the relationship including in particular the (enumerated) matters. " I refer to the discussion at [6.56] to [6.60] in D.C. Pearce and R.S. Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia , (6 th Edition, 2006) in relation to the meaning of the word "includes" in this context. It is clear that the decision-maker is required to assess the totality of the evidence and other available material in order to decide whether an applicant for a pension is a member of a couple, taking into account that the personal circumstances of people vary substantially : see Staunton-Smith v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1991] FCA 513 ; (1991) 32 FCR 164 at 170; Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs52" from="[2007] AATA 1846">Lambe v Director-General of Social Services [1981] FCA 171 ; (1981) 57 FLR 262. Lynam v Director of Social Security (1983) 52 ALR 128 ; (1983) 1 AAR 197. Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546. Re Secretary, Department Of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Foxley-Deschamps [2006] AATA 921 ; (2006) 92 ALD 767. Staunton-Smith v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1991] FCA 513 ; (1991) 32 FCR 164. Both of the above passages were also referred to as relevant to a consideration of the question of whether two persons were in a "marriage-like relationship" for the purposes of s. 4(2)(b) of the Act in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 at 543-4, [37] - [38] . In that case, at page 544, [39], French J also endorsed the statement of O'Loughlin J in Staunton-Smith at 173 that: 
 "... it is not sufficient to merely note that a couple are sharing accommodation, nor is it sufficient to note that one is financially dependent on the other; it is necessary to delve deeper to find the reasons for those arrangements. Those reasons will be better indicators in determining the correct nature of their relationship. " 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs53" from="[2007] AATA 1838">In assessing the above provisions against the evidence available, they are not exhaustive. This conveys the notion that none of the criteria in isolation can be determinative of whether there is a marriage-like relationship in existence, but that conclusion must be formed after considering the "total picture of the relationship" ( Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 per French J). </sentence>

 BACKGROUND 
 This is an application by the Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations ("the Applicant") for a review of a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal ("SSAT") made on 18 April 2005. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs55" from="[2007] AATA 1741">This section calls for the formation of an opinion about a relationship, by reference to matters set out in sub-section 4(3) which lists a number of factors relevant to determining the nature of a relationship. These include the financial aspects of the relationship, the nature of the household, the social aspects of the relationship, any sexual relationship between them, and their commitment to each other. This statutory framework was examined by the Federal Court in Pelka v Secretary Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs56" from="[2007] AATA 1651">Recently, in Pelka and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 , French J, referring to section 4(3) of the Act said that the decision-maker: 
 Must undertake the preceding consideration [i.e. in relation to section 4(3)] bearing in mind that a marriage-like relationship is not disclosed solely by any one of the following matters: 
 financial cooperation; cohabitation; a sexual relationship; cooperative household arrangements; mutual commitment.

 40. The list of factors referred to in section 169(2) of the Legislation Act is not exhaustive but they are factors to which the Tribunal should have regard in arriving at its decision. That no one factor is determinative of the issue, however, is made clear by the decision of the Federal Court of Australia in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family &amp; Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546. In that case the court held that in determining whether, for the purposes of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth), two persons were in a "marriage-like relationship" regard must be had to the interpersonal relationship as a whole bearing in mind that consideration must be given to those factors which weigh against such a relationship as well as those which weigh in favour of it. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs58" from="[2007] AATA 1556">Mr and Mrs Potros were not divorced until 2005. However I must determine if Mrs Potros was a member of a couple between 6 September 2001 and 16 December 2004. As to the indicia set out in subsection 4(3) of the Act, there is no one feature in Mr and Mrs Potros' relationship that stands out as dictating a conclusion. I have reached my conclusion after weighing up each factor from the totality of the evidence in accordance with Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs60" from="[2007] AATA 1439">The manner in which this task is to be undertaken has been authoritatively considered by French J in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2] where his Honour said: 
"Having regard to the current provisions of s 4(3) and the approaches discussed in the earlier authorities mentioned, a decision-maker concerned with whether an unmarried person is in a marriage-like relationship with another person of the opposite sex:
 Must have regard to their interpersonal relationship as a whole not limited by the factors listed in s 4(3). Must have regard to each of: (a) the financial aspects of the relationship; (b) the nature of the household; (c) the social aspects of the relationship; (d) any sexual relationship between the people; (e) the nature of the people's commitment to each other. In having regard to the preceding five matters, must have regard to all factors relevant to each and, in particular, must have regard to the factors listed under each heading in s 4(3). Must specifically consider the total picture of the relationship created by all of these factors bearing in mind that consideration must be given to those which weigh against a marriage-like relationship and those that weigh in favour of it. Must undertake the preceding consideration bearing in mind that a marriage-like relationship is not disclosed solely by any one of the following matters: (a) financial cooperation; (b) cohabitation; (c) a sexual relationship; (d) cooperative household arrangements; (e) mutual commitment.

<sentence id="cs61" from="[2007] AATA 1361">In Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 at 557 it was said:
 
 
 is not identified as a specific factor in s 4(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs62" from="[2007] AATA 1318">More recently, French J in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 had reason to deal with ss 4(2) and 4 (3) of the Act in the context of an application for a carer payment. He referred to the decision in Staunton-Smith and also to the decision of Fitzgerald J in Lynam v Director-General of Social Security (1983) 1 AAR 197. He stated that in determining whether a marriage-like relationship exists under the Act, the nature of the exercise is much the same as that required under the statutory formula used in Lynam, Staunton-Smith and in Lambe v Director-General of Social Services [1981] FCA 171 ; (1981) 57 FLR 262. In Lynam , Fitzgerald J said, at 200: 
 Each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which may point in one direction and some in the other. What must be looked at is the composite picture. Any attempt to isolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. The endless scope for differences in human attitudes and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration. In any particular case, it will be a question of fact and degree, a jury question, whether a relationship between two unrelated persons of the opposite sex meets the statutory test. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs63" from="[2007] AATA 1243">Four of these five factors noted in the section, list further and more specific matters to which a decision maker must have regard. It is not an exhaustive list. A decision maker can go further and wider, and must consider the total picture of the relationship that emerges from these factors, and which of them weigh against a marriage like relationship and which weigh in favour of it. Financial cooperation, cohabitation, a sexual relationship, cooperative household arrangements or mutual commitment, occurring alone, do not disclose, solely, a marriage like relationship. ( Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [1] ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs64" from="[2007] FMCA 458">It cited the decision of French J in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family &amp; Community Services [2006] FCA 735.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs65" from="[2007] AATA 1207">Mr and Mrs Halawi's remain married to each other, and for other purposes this may suffice to define their relationship. However I must determine if Mrs Halawi is a member of a couple. As to the indicia set out in section 4(3) of the Act, there is no one feature in Mr and Mrs Halawi's relationship that stands out as dictating a conclusion. I have reached my conclusion after weighing up each factor from the totality of the evidence in accordance with Pelka and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs66" from="[2007] AATA 73">Initially Ms Muller paid Mr Shepherd $200 per week rent through a real estate agent, however that arrangement ceased in 2004 when it was purportedly agreed that Mr Shepherd would forego rental payments in lieu of his child support payment responsibilities [5] . When forming an opinion about the relationship between two people for the purposes of the SS Act it is necessary to have regard to all the circumstances of the relationship as a whole, having specific regard to all of the matters set out at subsection 4(3) of the SS Act to form a total picture of the relationship [4] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs67" from="[2007] AATA 1050">Recently, in Pelka and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735 ; (2006) 151 FCR 546 , French J, referring to section 4(3) of the Act, said that the decision-maker: 


 
 Must undertake the preceding consideration [i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs68" from="[2006] AATA 1106">43. Useful guidance in the application of these provisions is to be found in the decision of French J in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [4] where his Honour said: [5] 
 
 
 "Having regard to the current provisions of s 4(3) and the approaches discussed in the earlier authorities mentioned, a decision-maker concerned with whether an unmarried person is in a marriage-like relationship with another person of the opposite sex: 
 
 
 1. Must have regard to their interpersonal relationship as a whole not limited by the factors listed in s 4(3). 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs69" from="[2006] AATA 1078">15. More useful guidance is obtained from the decision of French J in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family &amp; Community Services. [5] Whilst his Honour was there discussing a marriage-like relationship, the creature of s 4(2)(b) of the Social Security Act , the opinion about such a relationship is to be formed in the same way as the opinion about living separately and apart. Thus I consider that some of his Honour's observations are pertinent to the task that I have. His Honour said: [6] 
 
 
 Having regard to the current provisions of s 4(3) and the approaches discussed in the earlier authorities mentioned, a decision-maker concerned with whether an unmarried person is in a marriage-like relationship with another person of the opposite sex:

<sentence id="cs70" from="[2006] AATA 877">I have had regard not only to the specific criteria set out in section 4(3) of the Act, which are stated in non-exclusive terms, but to all the factors relevant to the relationship: Pelka v. Secretary, Department of Family &amp; Community Services [2006] FCA 735 , at paragraph 61.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs71" from="[2006] AATA 827">
 
 14. In considering the issues raised in this case I have the great benefit of the recent analysis of the concept of marriage-like relationship undertaken by French J in Pelka v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 735. In that case his Honour reviewed the legislation and case history and concluded, at [46]: 
 
 
 Having regard to the current provisions of s 4(3) and the approaches discussed in the earlier authorities mentioned, a decision-maker concerned with whether an unmarried person is in a marriage-like relationship with another person of the opposite sex:
