<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1211">The applicants' principal defence to infringement is invalidity of the patent. They also contend that, if the patent is valid, their products do not infringe the patent. On 3 June, 25 August and 10 November 2009 interlocutory orders were made restraining each of the applicants from selling their products pending the final hearing and determination of these proceedings (see Sigma Pharmaceuticals (Australia) Pty Ltd v Wyeth (2009) 81 IPR 339 ; [2009] FCA 595 and Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Wyeth (2009) 82 IPR 71 ; [2009] FCA 945). A4 Issues
 Subject to variations, the applicants assert invalidity of the patent on the grounds of: lack of novelty by reason of a deferred priority date and anticipation by another patent known as the Alza or Edgren patent; lack of fair basis; insufficiency; lack of clarity/ambiguity; lack of inventive step; false suggestions or misrepresentations; and lack of entitlement. Although there are differences between the applicants' arguments, Sigma's closing submissions provide a convenient summary of the "essence of the attack" on validity, namely: 
 
 (a) by amendments made to the Patent specification and claims on and subsequent to 20 December 2006, after filing of the complete specification and prior to acceptance, Wyeth has travelled beyond the disclosure in both the Priority Document and the Patent as filed and thus the claims asserted against [the applicants] are not entitled to claim a priority date prior to 20 December 2006;
 (b) if the priority date issue is resolved in [the applicants'] favour, the claims are anticipated by Wyeth's sale of its own form of EFEXOR XR (an extended release form of venlafaxine hydrochloride);
 (c) in any event, the invention purportedly claimed in claims 1 to 17 (and 27 insofar as it is dependent upon those claims) of the Patent does not disclose a manner of manufacture and is not inventive;
 (d) the amended form of the Patent was obtained upon the making of false representations to the Commissioner of Patents, which materially contributed to the grant;
 (e) Wyeth was not entitled to the Patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1212">(4) On 3 June 2009 orders were made enjoining Sigma from taking steps to exploit its generic extended release venlafaxine hydrochloride product ( Sigma Pharmaceuticals (Australia) Pty Ltd (ACN 004 118 594) v Wyeth (2009) IPR 339 ; [2009] FCA 595). (5) Wyeth applied for an interlocutory injunction against Alphapharm on 24 July 2009.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 542">Dr Lopert was referred to the decisions in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Wyeth and Ors [2009] FCA 945 and Sigma Pharmaceuticals (Australia) Pty Ltd v Wyeth and Ors [2009] FCA 595. In each of these cases, a generics company filed an application for revocation of Wyeth's patent and Wyeth then made a cross-claim for injunctive relief. Ms Allars said that the delays caused were the result of very complex proceedings. (The Tribunal notes that in both cases, the generics company was unaware of a 'method' (of manufacture) patent in relation to an extended release formulation of Wyeth's product. ) </sentence>
