<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] ACTSC 133"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 449">Mr Stretton expressed general agreement with Mr McCarthy's comments and referred the Tribunal to the decision in Dunstan v Orr [2008] FCA 31 , at [16], where Besanko J commented that Mr Dunstan: 
 
 remains obsessed by what he perceives to be the injustice involved in the way in which he was treated by the ATO, officers of the ATO and others. He tended to focus on matters which were not directly relevant to the issues in the proceeding. He is convinced there was a conspiracy against him ... 
 

  The Tribunal is not satisfied that Ms Orr's and Mr Higham's evidence would be relevant to the issues before the Tribunal since their actions in relation to Mr Dunstan took place after the events which were the subject of Mr Dunstan's compensation claims currently before the Tribunal. The Tribunal therefore decided to set aside the summons issued to Ms Orr and that issued to Mr Higham. The Tribunal notes that their conduct was reviewed by the Federal Court in Dunstan v Orr [2008] FCA 31 , in which Besanko J rejected Mr Dunstan's claim that they had acted improperly. 
  Ms Orr and Mr Higham were senior officers employed by the ATO. Both were recipients of letter bombs. On 4 June 1997, Ms Orr, as the delegate of the Secretary of the ATO, suspended Mr Dunstan from duty in relation to alleged computer mainframe usage and alleged systems violations in the period December 1996 to May 1997. On 18 June 1997, Mr Higham was appointed to investigate the matter and to consider whether Mr Dunstan should be charged with breach of his duties. Mr Dunstan's application to the Federal Court for a review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 in respect of the conduct of Ms Orr, Mr Higham and another officer was dismissed by Besanko J in Dunstan v Orr [2008] FCA 31.  Mr Stretton noted that Ms Ong was not called to give evidence in the Federal Court proceedings in Dunstan v Orr [2008] FCA 31. Since her involvement with Mr Dunstan was in relation to the computer violations that took place after the original tribunal proceedings, there is nothing to indicate that her evidence would be relevant to the current proceedings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1450">10 The reasons that I have already given are sufficient to find that the application is doomed to fail and therefore is an abuse of process. The respondents also put arguments to the Court along the lines that the present application involves a collateral attack on the decision made by Besanko J in Dunstan v Orr [2008] FCA 31. I am generally in sympathy with those submissions, however it is not necessary for me to rely on those submissions. In my view, the jurisdictional argument deals with the matter and is sufficient to grant the respondents the relief they seek.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 736">2 On 14 February 2008 Mr Dunstan filed a notice of appeal from orders made by Besanko J on 25 January 2008; [2008] FCA 31. At the Full Court callover for the ACT District Registry on 21 April 2008 Mr Dunstan, who appeared for himself, opposed the appeal being listed in the next Full Court period in August 2008 saying that he would be unavailable because he would be overseas for most of or possibly all of August. He said that it was to seek medical treatment for a confidential condition but did not give any further information other than to say that the trip had been planned since January and that it could not be taken earlier as he had a parole hearing on 13 May which might result in his parole being revoked and him being again taken into custody. </sentence>
