3 In this case before the settlement could be finally agreed between the parties the number of group members participating in the settlement had to be finally determined so that the precise entitlement of each group member could be ascertained. I made orders on 21 May 2008 to facilitate this process which, in general terms, involved group members sending proof of their share trading to Maurice Blackburn, the solicitors for the applicant, by a specified date. At a hearing on 14 August 2008, I heard argument as to whether persons who had not submitted their proof by the specified date should for that reason be excluded from participating in the settlement. On 26 August 2008 I made orders in relation to this issue. The reasons for these orders and the process by which the number of participating group members was determined are described in my reasons for judgment: Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Limited [2008] FCA 1311 ; (2008) 67 ACSR 569.

36 The presumption arising under s 160 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) is subject to evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption. This is an expression which appears in a number of Acts. 37 Recently in Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Limited [2008] FCA 1311 , Stone J had occasion to consider the meaning of the expression 'unless evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption is adduced' in s 160(1) within the context of representative proceedings under Pt IVA FCA. The Court had ordered that group members should provide proof of their share trading by 24 June 2008 in order to participate in a settlement. Some of the members of the group had failed to meet the deadline and the question was whether the failure led to exclusion.</sentence>
