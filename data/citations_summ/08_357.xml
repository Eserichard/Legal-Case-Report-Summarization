<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 855">Counsel for the Minister submitted that s 357A of the Act has the effect that the division in which it appears "provide(s) comprehensive procedural codes which contain detailed provisions for procedural fairness but which exclude the common law natural justice hearing rule ( Lay Lat at 225, [66]). Again, as McKerracher J held in Bunnag v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [41] at [31]: The provisions of s 357A of the Act make it clear that the content of Div 5 of Pt 5 is an exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule as it is to be applied in hearings before the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1372">Thus, a failure by a decision-maker to obtain important information on a critical issue, which the decision-maker knows or ought reasonably to know is readily available, may be characterised as so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker would proceeded to make the decision without making the enquiry... In this circumstance what vitiates the decision is the manner in which it was made. Since this is a limited proposition, it does not conflict with the larger statement that the Tribunal is under no general duty with respect to making enquiries... 
Appl'd: Bunnag v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 357 at [36] per McKerracher J. In circumstances where a migration agent forwards by way of facsimile a cover sheet together with a five page submission and where only the cover sheet is received, it has been held to be unreasonable for the Tribunal not to inquire about the missing pages: SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 , 164 FCR 14 per Allsop J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 430">On 12 November 2007 this Court dismissed the application. [37] An appeal against this Court's orders was dismissed by the Federal Court on 18 March 2008. [38] </sentence>
