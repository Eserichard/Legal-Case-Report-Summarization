<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 29">Similarly, as is apparent from the primary judge's reasons at [119]-[121], no particular factor, including the prior records of Mr McDonald and the CFMEU, gave rise to any material point of distinction necessitating or rationally permitting a different treatment of each in terms of general and specific deterrence. The primary judge accepted the appellants' submission that the prior record of a large organisation such as the CFMEU must be treated with caution (at [58]). The appellants acknowledged the same two prior matters as being relevant prior conduct in relation to each of them ( Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169) (at [60] and [63]). The primary judge considered that "some regard" may be had to prior contraventions if the contraventions involved the "same primary elements", but described a full comparison as potentially difficult and possibly "not worthwhile" (at [64]). The primary judge concluded that, while it was appropriate to have regard to the information about prior contraventions (with the contraventions acknowledged as relevant by the appellants being "the most relevant"), it was necessary to be cautious. In the circumstances, the primary judge was not bound to conclude that there were different considerations of general and specific deterrence applicable to Mr McDonald and the CFMEU. More generally, there could be no "justifiable sense of grievance" ( Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46 ; (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610) on the part of either appellant having regard to the penalty imposed on each.  The number of prior cases is small, and the cases themselves are all highly fact-dependent. In its written submissions the respondent identifies the key features which can be said to distinguish the cases on which the appellants rely from the present case. These submissions expose the flaw in this aspect of the appellants' submissions, and show why the respondent's submissions in this regard must be accepted: 
 
 [12] The appellants' approach is also faulty because, in making a crude comparison with the "per breach" penalties in the earlier cases involving each of them, no recognition is given to the totality principle and related "course of conduct" issues that applied in both prior cases: see Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v CFMEU [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at 390-1 [70]- [76]; and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169 at 186 [56] to 91 [78]. While a court is required to start by ascertaining a penalty which is appropriate for each contravention, it must also have regard to the total or overall penalty being imposed: see Pearce at 623-4 [45] [ Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 ; [1998] HCA 57] ; see also Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70 ; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63 in relation to the totality principle more generally and Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 in relation to the application of that principle to proceedings of this kind. Moreover, in Leighton , the respondent intervened and submitted that the penalties proposed and agreed upon between the parties were inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 845">A Court which hears, as this one does, a regular diet of penalty proceedings and which, with the aid of experienced counsel appearing for parties and of its own researches, keeps up to date with developments in this specialist field senses, perhaps more acutely than a more generalist Court which only deals with them from time to time, the danger of being accused of citing by rote the matters appropriate to be taken into consideration. A Court could even feel embarrassment at quoting once again the highly relevant and considered views of Buchanan J in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 246 ALR 35 at [91] that: "These matters should not be treated as "a rigid catalogue of matters for attention". The overriding principle is for the Court to "fix penalty which pays appropriate regard to the circumstances in which the contraventions have occurred and the need to sustain public confidence in the statutory regime which imposes the obligation. "" 
The Court is of course sensible of the fact that it is not writing for solely an appellate division but is explaining to those whose conduct has offended the reasons why it has chosen a particular penalty to be imposed. It is for this reason that it is necessary to set out those matters that the Court proposes to take into account even though they have been expressed before in such cases as CFMEU v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at 232 [7-8] per Branson J; Stewart-Mahony v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61 ; Alfred v Wakelin (No 1) [2008] FCA 1455 ; Alfred v Wakelin (No 4) [2009] FCA 267 ; (2009) 180 IR 335 ; Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169. The circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 826">The applicant acknowledged that similar factors have been applied in relation to penalties for unlawful industrial action in contravention of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (the BCII Act) (see Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2008) 177 IR 61 ; [2008] FCA 1426 ; Alfred v Wakelin (No.1) [2008] FCA 1455 at [28] ; and Alfred v Wakelin (No 4) (2009) 180 IR 335 ; [2009] FCA 267 at [15] ), although courts have also taken into account other factors relevant to the particular circumstances of the contraventions in issue (see for example Temple v Powell (2008) 169 FCR 169 ; [2008] FCA 714 at [56] --- [57] per Dowsett J and the discussion of these principles in Fair Work Ombudsman v AWU, NSW [2010] FMCA 744). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 786">In relation to prior contraventions the respondents made the following submission in relation to similar previous conduct: [11] "17. The respondents submit the following principle should be applied in the Court's consideration of prior contraventions: (a) prior contraventions are relevant and may justify heavier sentence than may otherwise be imposed but, in the absence of statute, they cannot lead to the imposition of a penalty that is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence: see Veen v The Queen (No.2) [1988] HCA 14 ; [1988] 164 CLR 465 at 477-478; (b) prior contraventions of a different statute and/or of a different character should not be considered as relevant prior contraventions or relevant prior conduct: see Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v CFMEU [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at 390 and Stuart-Mahoney v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1426 at [44] ; (c) prior contraventions of another autonomous division and/or branch of the first respondent should not be taken into account see Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v CFMEU [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at 390 and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 173 IR 189 at [63] ; (d) conduct engaged in prior 3 March 2008 and for which a contravention was not recoded until 3 March 2008, is not a prior contravention: see Alfred v Walter Construction Group Ltd [2005] FCA 497 at 13; (e) If conduct prior 3 March 2008 for which a contravention was not recorded prior to 3 March 2008, is taken into account it is to be given less weight than a prior contravention: see R v McInerney (1986) 42 SASR 111 at 113 and 124; (f) In relation to the second respondent, the only prior contraventions which are relevant are those which relate to his conduct, of which there are none. 18. In Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v CFMEU (supra) the Supreme Court of Western Australian (sic) in fixing a penalty for unlawful industrial action in contravention of s38 of the BCII Act, was referred to eight proceedings against the CFMEU over the previous 6 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 744">There have been a number of authorities which set out what I will describe as " non-exhaustive range of matters " relevant to determining penalty in unlawful industrial action proceedings. The applicant in the instant case refers to those considered by Branson J in CFMEU v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No.2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at 232 [7-8] whereas the respondent refers to those considered by Tracey J in Stuart-Mahoney v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61. Other cases in which these matters have been considered outside the Federal Magistrates Court are Alfred v Wakelin (No.1) [2008] FCA 1455 ; Alfred v Wakelin (No.4) [2009] FCA 267 and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714. As the respondent notes: "These matters should not be treated as " a rigid catalogue of matters for attention "; the overriding principle is for the Court " to fix penalty which pays appropriate regard to the circumstances in which the contraventions have occurred and the need to sustain public confidence in the statutory regime which imposes the obligation "; Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 at [91] per Buchanan J.

Individual (no previous contraventions; contraventions admitted): $2,000 for s 38 contravention (9% of maximum), $6,000 for s 43 contravention (27% of maximum), but note that both penalties were suspended for 12 months.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 977">The parties agree that the applicable principles in relation to this factor are as follows: 
(1) Similar prior relevant conduct may be taken into account in assessing penalty, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty that is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant contravention: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14 ; (1988) 164 CLR 465 ( Veen ), Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 477. (2) Similar previous conduct may demonstrate that a respondent has a history of engaging in the particular conduct in question, that the penalties previously imposed were insufficient to deter the respondent from re-engaging in that conduct and that the respondent has failed to take adequate steps to prevent further contraventions Veen at 477; Mahoney at [44]; Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169 ( Temple ) at [64]. (3) A respondent is not to be punished again for the prior conduct. Prior conduct may diminish leniency by reason of good character, having an upward affect on penalty, albeit within the proper limits indicated by the circumstances of the immediately contravening conduct: The Queen v McInerney (1986) 42 SASR 111 ( McInerney ), King CJ at 113.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 784">Adopting these approaches, in Temple v Powell (2008) 169 FCR 169 ; [2008] FCA 714 , Dowsett J at [46] found accessorial involvement of two union officials (including, co-incidentally Mr McDonald, the current third respondent) made out by virtue of their "attendance at, and conduct of, the relevant meeting, and, perhaps, the subsequent notification to management of the proposed strike". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCAFC 90">The correct position in relation to the relevance of prior convictions is, as the ABC Commissioner submitted, as stated by Dowsett J in Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169 at [64] : 
 
 
 [64] The respondents submitted that "... prior contraventions of industrial legislation per se should not be taken into account when assessing prior conduct. What should be relevant is prior breaches of provisions which contain the same elements in the case under consideration". I do not accept that proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FCA 48">The relevant considerations in assessing an appropriate penalty for breaches of the BCII Act have been extensively discussed by this Court; see eg, Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2008) 177 IR 61 ; [2008] FCA 1426 at [40] per Tracey J; Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169 at [56] ---[78] per Dowsett J and Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 4) [2009] FCA 1040 at [9] ---[10] per Kenny J.

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 (Ex tempore) 
 Murray Gregor ("the applicant") is an inspector appointed pursuant to s.57 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 
 2005 ("the BCII Act"). On 20 May 2009 the applicant commenced proceedings against the Construction Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ("the first respondent") and Daniel Berardi ("the second respondent"). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 1248">In relation to the relevance of prior contraventions the respondent's submissions were: "20. The respondents submit the following principle should be applied in the Court's consideration of prior contraventions: a. prior contraventions are relevant and may justify heavier sentence than may otherwise be imposed but, in the absence of statute, they cannot lead to the imposition of a penalty that is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence: see Veen v The Queen (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14 ; [1988] 164 CLR 465 at 477 - 478; b. prior contraventions of a different statute and/or of a different character should not be considered as relevant prior contraventions or relevant prior conduct: see Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v CFMEU [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at 390 and Stuart-Mahoney v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1426 at [44] ; c. prior contraventions of another autonomous division and/or branch of the first respondent should not be taken into account: see Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v CFMEU [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at 390 and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 173 IR 189 at [63] ; d. conduct engaged in prior to 3 October 2006 and for which a contravention was not recorded until 3 October 2006 is not a prior contravention: see Alfred v Walter Construction Group Ltd [2005] FCA 497 at 13; e. if conduct prior to 3 October 2006 for which a contravention was not recorded prior to 3 October 2006, is taken into account it is to be given less weight than a prior contravention: see R v McInerney (1986) 42 SASR 111 at 113 and 124; f. In relation to the second respondent, the only prior contraventions which are relevant are those which relate to his conduct (although it is noted in this case the application does not seek a penalty to be imposed on the second respondent). 21. In Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v CFMEU (Supra) the Supreme Court of Western Australian in fixing a penalty for unlawful industrial action in contravention of s38 of the BCII Act, was referred to eight proceedings against the CFMEU over the previous 6 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCA 1040">I agree with his Honour's observations: compare Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2 ) [2009] FCA 548 at [16] per Jessup J and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 173 IR 189 at 209 [64] per Dowsett J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCA 865">2) (supra at [17] of these reasons) a non-exhaustive list of considerations to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion in respect of a contravention of what was Part XA of the Act, her Honour was not intending to convey the impression that by making reference to whether previous contraventions of Part XA of the Act had occurred, her Honour was suggesting that previous contraventions of other provisions of the Act or other contraventions relevant to the exercise of the discretion ought to be excluded from consideration. I respectfully agree with the observations on these matters of Jessup J in Williams v CFMEU (No. 2) and Dowsett J in Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 173 IR 189 at [64] . I respectfully disagree with the approach adopted in Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v CFMEU [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at 389 --- 390 [67] per Le Miere J. I disagree in the sense that the exercise of the discretion ought not to be fettered by an exclusionary rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FCA 787">There are three instances of similar previous conduct by the Union involving breaches of s 38 ; see Stuart-Mahoney, Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169 and Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 299. Although the relevant conduct in Temple , concerned breaches by the Western Australian Branch of the Union of s 38 of the Act, nevertheless the conduct is previous relevant conduct; see Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No. 2) [2009] FCA 548 per Jessup J at [22]---[25], see also Temple per Dowsett J at [63]. The second respondent has not engaged in any similar previous conduct. In contrast to the circumstances in Stuart-Mahoney, Temple and Duffy (No 2) , the respondents' conduct on 6 October 2006 was of limited duration and impact and penalties at the lower end of the scale are appropriate. </sentence>

See also the judgment of Dowsett J in Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169 , especially at [56] ff in relation to "penalties" and the earlier Full Court decision in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Hamberger [2003] FCAFC 38 ; (2003) 127 FCR 309 at [51] . [4] I have omitted reference to Mr Cook's internal citations in relation to deterrence, "the message" to be communicated, and the "meaningful level" of penalty to be imposed. Such matters, as I shortly show, are dealt with by the Full Court in McAlary-Smith and other cases to which I refer.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FCA 650">The Applicant relied on the conviction which was imposed on the CFMEU in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1758 (which varied the declaration of Kiefel J in BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2000] FCA 1853 , see further [42] below), as a relevant prior conviction. In that case the CFMEU was also required to pay indemnity costs: see BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union [2002] FCA 702. The CFMEU accepted that prior convictions were relevant and may justify a heavier penalty than might otherwise be imposed. Counsel for the CFMEU told the Court that the CFMEU had not been found guilty of contempt of Court in relation to any earlier action taken in Victoria; the "only potential prior conviction" of the CFMEU was the conviction imposed in the BHP Steel case. It was submitted that "prior convictions of another autonomous division and/or autonomous branch of the respondent should not be taken into account". Reliance was placed on Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169. Alternatively, the CFMEU submitted that, if the fine was considered a relevant prior conviction, in the absence of statutory provision, it could not lead to the imposition of a penalty that was disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence: see Hoare v The Queen [1989] HCA 33 ; (1989) 167 CLR 348 ; Veen v The Queen [1979] HCA 7 ; (1979) 143 CLR 458 and Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14 ; (1988) 164 CLR 465. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] FCA 548">Turning to the third question, counsel for the respondents submitted that "prior contraventions of another autonomous division and/or branch of the first respondent should not be taken into account". He relied in this respect upon the passage of the judgment from Le Miere J in Leighton Contractors to which I have referred above, and upon the following passage in the judgment of Dowsett J in Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 173 IR 189 , 209 [63]: 
 The respondents submitted that in a large organisation such as the CFMEU, with autonomous state branches, it is not necessarily appropriate to treat conduct by all branches throughout the country as relevant past conduct for the purpose of fixing a penalty in connection with the unlawful conduct of one branch. There is substance in that submission. Whether previous misconduct is relevant to fixing a penalty is a question of logic.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] FMCA 272">Further, the remarks of Dowsett J in Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 , (2008) 173 IR 189 are also relevant. At [64], his Honour said: "The respondent submitted that "... contraventions of industrial legislation per se should not be taken into account when assessing prior conduct. What should be relevant is prior breaches of provisions which contain the same elements in the case under consideration. " I do not accept that proposition. On the criminal side, it has never been suggested that only previous convictions for offences similar to that charge are relevant to sentence. Rather, a sentencing court looks to the general record of conduct of the relevant offender, his or her attitude to the law as disclosed by such conduct, apparent attempts at rehabilitation and similar considerations. Repeated conduct of a particular kind may lead to an identified need to prove some particularly persuasive form of deterrent against similar future misconduct. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] FMCA 236">The CFMEU has already been punished for its prior contravention which disentitles it from securing any discount for "having a clean slate". Prior contraventions of the same or similar legislation are relevant in assessing penalty. Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 per Dowsett J at [64]: "64 The respondents submitted that "... prior contraventions of industrial legislation per se should not be taken into account when assessing prior conduct. What should be relevant is prior breaches of provisions which contain the same elements in the case under consideration. " I do not accept that proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2009] FCA 267">In Alfred v Wakelin (No 1) (at [28] to [31]) I referred to certain decisions which identified principles of general application to the question of penalty: 
 28 In Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) (1999) 94 IR 231 ; [1999] FCA 1714 Branson J identified certain factors relevant to the assessment of whether conduct calls for a penalty to be imposed and, if so, the amount of the penalty as including: 

 
 (a) The circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place (including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act);
 (b) Whether the respondent has previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of ...the Act;
 (c) Where more than one contravention ...is involved, whether the various contraventions are properly seen as distinct or whether they arise out of the one course of conduct;
 (d) The consequences of the conduct found to be in contravention ...of the Act;
 (e) The need, in the circumstances, for the protection of industrial freedom of association; and
 (f) The need, in the circumstances, for deterrence. 

 
 29 Observations in other cases are also relevant. In Leighton Contractors (2006) 164 IR 375 ; [2006] WASC 317 at [58] Le Miere J made the following comment when dealing with contraventions of the BCII Act: 

 
 [ 58 ] Contraventions of the Act, whether by individuals or organisations, are always to be treated as a serious matter. The main object of the Act is to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building work to ensure that building work is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole. 

 
 30 In Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 at [58] Tracey J observed as follows: 

 
 ...in light of the statutory purposes of the BCII Act, the need for general deterrence for contraventions of the BCII Act is particularly strong. Penalties must be imposed at a meaningful level if they are to serve as a general deterrent to others who may be disposed to engage in proscribed conduct. 

 
 31 Any penalty must nevertheless be proportionate to the conduct of the individual or organisation in contravention ( Temple v Powell (2008) 173 IR 189 ; [2008] FCA 714 at [58] ).

<sentence id="cs20" from="[2008] FCA 1455">31 Any penalty must nevertheless be proportionate to the conduct of the individual or organisation in contravention ( Temple v Powell (2008) 173 IR 189 ; [2008] FCA 714 at [58] ).  Hadgkiss v Aldin (2007) 164 FCR 394 ; [2007] FCA 2068 involved more serious contraventions and resulted in fines on individuals of $9000 and $7500 with two thirds suspended in the form of a good behaviour bond (that is, effective fines of $3000 and $2500). Suspended fines also act as a deterrent. Temple v Powell (2008) 173 IR 189 ; [2008] FCA 714 involved far more serious conduct with more serious consequences and resulted in a fine of $12,000 on the CFMEU and $2500 for an employed organiser of the CFMEU. Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2006) 164 IR 375 ; [2006] WASC 317 involved a multiplicity of offences in contrast to the present case and that in Temple v Powell . In Leighton Contractors , the parties agreed and the Court imposed penalties of $90,000 on the CFMEU, $30,000 on the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union of Workers and $30,000 on a CFMEU official.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] FCA 1292">45 I accept that, in relying on Laing , Dowsett J in Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 at [50] - [52] apparently adopted a broad view of the scope of paras (b) and (c) of the definition of "building industrial action" in s 36(1) of the BCII Act, which would extend the paragraph to unions. This case, however, proceeded by way of an agreed statement of facts, the parties agreeing that the union had contravened s 38 of the BCII Act, and his Honour's attention was not drawn to the relevant passages in Davids or Giudice . The same may be said of the earlier judgment of Le Miere J in Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 4) [2006] WASC 317 (" Leighton "), at [28]-[31] where once again reliance was placed on Laing without reference to Davids or Giudice . </sentence>
