<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 366">In relation to the second element, in my view one or more of those claims (see [7] to [8]) falls within items mentioned in the table in O 8 r 2. The substance of those causes of action (item 1) arose in Australia: Distillers Co (Bio-chemicals) Ltd v Thompson [1971] 1 NSWLR 83 at 90; Webster Computer Systems Pty Ltd v Fujitsu Ltd [2007] FCA 825 at [13]; Anabelle [2007] FCA 1190 at [13] - [15]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 735">This proceeding is of a kind described in Item 13 of the Table to O 8 r 2. It is sufficient for the grant of leave if any one of the causes of action falls within an item in the Table to O 8 r 2 ( Webster Computer Systems Pty Ltd v Fujitsu Ltd [2007] FCA 825 at [11] and [12] per Conti J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 288">I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Conti J, which were handed down on 29 May 2007 (see Webster Computer Systems Pty Ltd v Fujitsu Ltd [2007] FCA 825). Without repeating the reasons for judgement expressed by me in Anabelle Bits Pty Ltd v Fujitsu Ltd [2007] FCA 1190 on 26 July 2007 and the further reasons given by me in relation to a similar application in that matter earlier today, it seems clear to me that there is sufficient material to indicate that the Court has jurisdiction in the proceeding number NSD 306 of 2007 and that the proceeding is of a kind mentioned in Order 8 rule 2. Evidence from the Commonwealth Attorney General's Department demonstrates that there is no convention, treaty or other agreement in force between Australia and Japan on the service of documents in civil proceedings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1190">10 In a substantially similar case ( Webster Computer Systems Pty Limited v Fujitsu Limited NSD 306 of 2007) which is presently in Cowdroy J's docket, Conti J made an order on 9 May which was the subject of his Honour's reasons for judgment of 29 May ( Webster Computer Systems Pty Ltd v Fujitsu Ltd [2007] FCA 825). Conti J ordered as follows:
 
 'The applicant have leave pursuant to Order 8 Rule 3(2) of the Federal Court Rules to serve the application and statement of claim on the first respondent by using the diplomatic channel. ' </sentence>
