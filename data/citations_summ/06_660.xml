<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 1046">The respondents' first submission is that paragraph 8(1)(b) of the State Act does no more than identify a function of the Board and that it is not mandatory for the Board to determine, in writing, the class or classes of persons to participate in an ACC State investigation. Although there is good reason to think that it is a mandatory requirement ( D v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 660 ; (2006) 152 FCR 497 at 507-508 [53] - [54]) I do not need to decide the point because I am satisfied that examiners may exercise their powers under the State Act even though not identified in a determination. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 803">Mr Abbott submitted that items 2(b) and 3(b) of Schedule 2 exceeded the powers of the Board under s 7C(1)(e) of the Act in that they impermissibly purported to delegate to persons other than the Board the power to identify persons authorised to participate in the special investigation mentioned in Schedule 1. However, in oral submissions, Mr Abbott conceded that Mansfield J had rejected a similar contention in D v Australian Crime Commission (2006) 152 FCR 497 ; [2006] FCA 660 (" D ") and he could not submit that his Honour was plainly or clearly wrong. In D , Mansfield J rejected this contention (which was put at [52]) in the following terms (at [58]): 
 
 I do not consider that s 7C(1)(e) requires a determination in terms that, upon its making all the persons who may participate in a particular ACC operation or investigation are then immediately capable of identification. There is no reason why that should be so.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 759">I was told by the parties that there is no case which determines in an authoritative way the scope and effect of s 16. The section was referred to in passing in P v Board of Australian Crime Commission (2006) 151 FCR 114 at 121 [24]- [26] and D v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 660 ; (2006) 152 FCR 497 at 503 [31] per Mansfield J.  The submission was considered by Mansfield J in D v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 660 ; (2006) 152 FCR 497 at [28] - [60] and rejected. With respect, I think his Honour's decision is correct and I will follow it. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 580">SS asserted that these items impermissibly sought to delegate to persons other than the Board the power to identify persons authorised to participate in an intelligence operation. Moreover, the purported delegation operates prospectively and thus is not limited to persons having the relevant duties at the time the ATS determination was made. SS acknowledged that Mansfield J dismissed a submission to the same effect in D v Australian Crime Commission (2006) 152 FCR 497 ; [2006] FCA 660. SS, however, did not identify any argument indicating why Mansfield J's conclusions in D v Australian Crime Commission should not be followed. I adopt the conclusion set out in [58] of D v Australian Crime Commission and the preceding reasons Mansfield J gave in support, namely: 
 I do not consider that s 7C(1)(e) requires a determination in terms that, upon its making all the persons who may participate in a particular ACC operation or investigation are then immediately capable of identification.</sentence>
