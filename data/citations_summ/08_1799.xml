<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 688">Moreover, in O'Shea v Heinemann Electric Pty Ltd (2008) 172 FCR 475 ; [2008] FCA 1799 Middleton J suggested that while s.507 of the Workplace Relations Act (the predecessor to s.474 of the FWA insofar as it relates to unprotected industrial action) was in different terms to s.187AA, basically the same purpose was behind both provisions. As Middleton J stated at [28] --- [29]: It seems one purpose of the operation of s 507 is to deter industrial action for minor grievances. An employee will seriously consider stopping work for just 5 minutes if the consequence is losing a half day's pay.</sentence>
