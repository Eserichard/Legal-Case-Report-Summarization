In Edelsten v Ward (No 2) (1988) 63 ALJR 346 , Brennan J again referred to the jurisdiction as an " exceptional jurisdiction ". Section 25(2) has been invoked by other Judges of this Court sitting alone when considering an application to grant a stay of a decision of a Full Court and the principles espoused by Brennan J have there been applied: eg, Wainter Pty Ltd; In the matter of New Tel Ltd [2005] FCA 1224 , 54 ACSR 554. See also: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Manaf (No 2) [2009] FCA 993 ; SZKUO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1570 ; Employment Services Australia Pty Ltd v Poniatowska [2010] FCA 1043. Sometimes the application for a stay is heard before one of the Judges who constituted the Full Court whose decision is under challenge: eg, George v Fletcher (No 2) [2010] FCA 655. But it need not be.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWCA 373">23 The divergence of approach I identified in Miller was referred to without demur by Tobias JA (Ipp and Campbell JJA agreeing) in Bennette v Cohen (No 2) [2009] NSWCA 162 (at [63] --- [65]). Jagot J also accepted that such a divergence of approach existed, and that she would, if necessary, apply the less stringent approach, in SZKUO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1570 ; (2009) 262 ALR 632 (at [8] --- [10]).</sentence>
