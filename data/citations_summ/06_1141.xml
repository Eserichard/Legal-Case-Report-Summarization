<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 313">111 Mr Faulkner relies on the usual rule that costs should follow the event. He emphasises that Dr Monks has been wholly successful in defending the proceedings. He submits that there has been no disentitling conduct on Dr Monks' part and that it was reasonable for her to raise the defence of illegality in the circumstances of the case. I agree. I also take into account the fact that the discretion to apportion costs is one to be exercised only in the most exceptional of circumstances: Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Limited (No 3) (1979) 42 FLR 213. As noted above, it has been said that a court should be mindful not to discourage litigants from canvassing all material issues for fear of an adverse costs order. Reliance was placed by Mr Faulkner on Stena Rederi Aktiblag v Austal Ships Sales Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1141 and Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 115">1 This appeal concerns the reward for salvage fixed by Tamberlin J in favour of the appellants at AUD850 000 ( United Salvage Pty Ltd v Louis Dreyfus Armateurs SNC [2006] FCA 1141). The first appellant is an international salvage operator; the second appellant the owner of the tug the 'Tom Tough' and the third appellant the owner of the tugs the 'Wistari' and the 'Kuttabul' . The 'Tom Tough' and the 'Wistari' are salvage capable tugs. The three tugs were involved in the provision of salvage services to the ship La Pampa at Gladstone Harbour, Queensland on 27 March 2002. The appellants ('the salvors') contend that the reward is inadequate and results from errors as to facts and as to the criteria to be applied in assessing a reward.
