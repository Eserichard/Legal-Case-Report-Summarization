15 In relation to Mr Rundle, ASIC relied upon evidence of asset dissipation prior to these proceedings. The transaction relied upon involved the transfer to his wife of his interest in their matrimonial home. It was described in my reasons for judgment given on 9 November 2007 in connection with consent orders affecting Mr Rundle: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd ACN 009 071 968 v Carey (No 18) [2007] FCA 1718. In that case, as I noted, ASIC was prepared to accept the proposed consent orders which dispensed with the continued appointment of a receiver to Mr Rundle's property on the basis that: 
1. The process of identification of the property was complete. 
 2. He had been generally cooperative with the receiver and ASIC expected that he would comply with the freezing orders then proposed. </sentence>
