<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 709">In my view, no order under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Act) should be made suppressing access to these documents. The only evidence led in support of the making of that order was the assertion by Mr Murdoch that the information in the documents was confidential and commercially sensitive. However, an order under s 50 will not be made solely on the basis of the subjective assertion by the person seeking the order. There is also an objective criterion to be satisfied ( Autodata Limited v Boyce's Automotive Data Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1517). There was no evidentiary foundation laid to support an objective assessment of the confidentiality or commercial sensitivity of the documents. It was not obvious from a perusal of the documents that the information contained therein was commercially sensitive. The document disclosing the contract rates and Mr Iannello's letter of 16 November 2007 could possibly be objectively commercially sensitive but, in the absence of any evidentiary foundation, I am unable to reach that conclusion, without engaging in speculation. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that a suppression order under s 50 of the Act should be made in respect of the documents comprising "Confidential Exhibit SM-1". </sentence>
