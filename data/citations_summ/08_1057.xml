<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 320">The applicant further contended that if Coynes were liable to pay duty and entitled to receive a remission, that circumstance did not constitute a defence to a demand under s 35A. The applicant submitted that consistently with the legislative goal of protection of the revenue, entitlement to remission of duty could not affect liability under s 35A, as the revenue could otherwise suffer loss without the compensation the legislature intended. Goods could be lost, diminished in value or stolen prior to entry for home consumption and if, in such case, the duty were remitted in recognition of the owner's hardship, the revenue would have sustained loss, unless compensation were available under s 35A. Section 35A did not impose a tax, but provided compensation for 'escaped' duty. The compensatory nature of the liability under s 35A indicated that it must apply irrespective of the remission of duty, which was confined to the distinct and entirely different liability to pay duty. Accordingly, in Drew v Dibb [2008] FCA 1057 ; (2008) 169 FCR 320 , Finkelstein J recognised that the availability of a rebate or remission of duty did not constitute a defence to a demand under s 35A.  In Drew v Dibb [2008] FCA 1057 ; (2008) 169 FCR 320 , Finkelstein J considered warehouse licensees liability for allegedly valueless imported cigarettes which were stolen from their warehouse. At the date of the theft, s 35A coexisted with s 92(4) of the Act, which provided that the licensee of any warehouse shall: 
 
 pay the duty on all warehoused goods removed from its warehouse except by the authority and on all warehoused goods not produced to the officer on demand unless such goods are accounted for to the satisfaction of the Collector.
