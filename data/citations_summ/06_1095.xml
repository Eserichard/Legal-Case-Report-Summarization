<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 145"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1246">The applicant alleged that the Tribunal rejected the various integers of his claims individually without considering them in their totality. He cited what Jacobson J had said in SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 91 at [53] and [54]: It is well established that in determining whether the persecutory conduct claimed by an applicant amounts to serious harm, the Tribunal is under a duty to consider the "totality of the case put forward": NBFP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 95 at [54] --- [62]; VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 927 ; (2004) 81 ALD 332 at [62] ; Khan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1478 at [31] . In doing so, it must consider each integer of the claims: VTAO at [62]; Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 ; (2001) 194 ALR 244. As Weinberg J said in MZWPD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1095 at [69] , the Tribunal was bound to consider each incident of alleged persecution, not merely in isolation but also in conjunction with the others. An act that might not amount to persecutory conduct involving serious harm when viewed in isolation may do so when considered in its full context. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 782">However, as Jacobsen J said in SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 91 at [53] the Tribunal has a duty to consider the totality of the case put forward. His Honour referred to the judgment of Weinberg J in MZWPD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1095 at [69] that the Tribunal was bound to consider each incident of alleged persecution, not merely in isolation, but also in conjunction with the others. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 91">54 As Weinberg J said in MZWPD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1095 at [69] , the Tribunal was bound to consider each incident of alleged persecution, not merely in isolation but also in conjunction with the others. An act that might not amount to persecutory conduct involving serious harm when viewed in isolation may do so when considered in its full context.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 2097">These findings were clearly findings of fact, and an assessment of the relevant degree and the nature of the harm (whether serious or something lesser) and it was for the Tribunal to make (see in particular SZBOV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1407 (" SZBOV ") at [19]). (Note SZBOV cited with approval in SZGPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 683 at [42] , per Collier J; see also MZWPD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1095 at [85] , per Weinberg J, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFDJ [2006] FCAFC 53 at [17] , per Ryan, Tamberlin and Mansfield JJ. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 1318">81 The jurisdictional error in this case may possibly be formulated in other ways. It is well established that the Tribunal must consider all the substantive issues raised by the evidence before it, even if the applicant does not clearly articulate all such claims: see NAZH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 5 at [51] per Madgwick J; MZWPD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1095 at [69] - [85] per Weinberg J; SBBA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 90 at [8] per Weinberg, Stone and Jacobson JJ; and Sellamuthu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 247 ; (1999) 90 FCR 287 at 294 per Wilcox and Madgwick JJ. In the present case, it could well be said that the Tribunal did not consider whether the primary decision-maker's perception of what had occurred at the Departmental interview was fundamentally defective because of the mistranslation of Mr Nguyen's statement. As we have seen, this issue was clearly raised on the evidence, including specifically by Mr Nguyen. As this possibility was not the subject of argument, it is unnecessary to consider it further. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FMCA 287">VTAO has been cited with approval; see, for example, MZWPD &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1095 , where Weinberg J cited the decision in Htun as requiring every integer of the applicant's claim to be considered and then referred to VTAO as authority for the proposition that it is possible that individual instances of discrimination may not be considered persecution when considered as isolated incidents, but may amount to persecution when considered cumulatively (at [84]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] FMCA 1026">The first error was to consider separately the elements of this claim but not to consider the cumulative impact of the various elements of the claim [18] .</sentence>
