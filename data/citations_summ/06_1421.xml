<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] FCA 1571">9 Her counsel developed that argument by reference to the Tribunal's letter which invited the appellant to a hearing. That letter included the observation that the Tribunal had considered the material before it, but was unable to make a decision on that information alone. There was no new information before the Tribunal, only the information that was before the delegate. The appellant submitted because she did not attend the hearing, the Tribunal had to give particulars of the information it relied on to reject her application. This argument falls at its first hurdle. The Tribunal did not reject the application on the basis of any information but rather on account of a lack of, or insufficiency of, information such that the claims of the appellant were characterised as "untested assertions"; see SZING v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1421 at [4] to [5] and the authorities referred to in that judgment.</sentence>
