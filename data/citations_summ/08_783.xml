<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 822">A helpful review and summary of the relevant authorities is found in Re Universal Music (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sharman Licence Holdings Ltd; Ex parte Merlin BV [2008] FCA 783 at [30] - [44] per Jacobson J: [30] With the exception of one authority to which I will refer later, the principles which govern the exercise of the discretion to grant access by a non-party under O 46 r 6 are to be found in cases dealing with applications by media organisations. [31] This is hardly surprising because the principle which informs the exercise of the power is that of open justice, the underlying rationale being the belief that exposure to public scrutiny is the surest safeguard against abuse of power of the courts: see Seven Network at [21]ff; Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd ; ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 2) [2006] FCA 407 ; [2006] FCA 407 ; (2006) 232 ALR 398 at [16] ff; Rich v Harrington [2007] FCA 1979 ; (2007) 99 ALD 297 at [17] ff. [32] In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd (No 3) [2002] FCA 609 , Finkelstein J said at [7] that the proper approach is that access should be allowed unless the interests of justice require a different course.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 230">This statement of principle has been applied in a number of first instance decisions of this Court: see Nicholls v Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2009] FCA 123 at [4] per Mansfield J; Re Universal Music (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sharman Licence Holdings Ltd; Ex parte Merlin BV [2008] FCA 783 at [31] - [33] per Jacobson J; Rich v Harrington [2007] FCA 1979 at [23] per Branson J; Y v University of Western Australia (No 2) [2006] FCA 466 ; (2006) 151 FCR 322 at 332 [46] per Siopis J; Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 2) [2006] FCA 407 ; (2006) 232 ALR 398 at 403 [18] per French J. The earlier decision of Finkelstein J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 3) [2002] FCA 609 was to a similar effect except that the reasoning was in terms at [7] confined to: 
... cases where a non-party seeks access to material which has been relied upon by the judge. </sentence>
