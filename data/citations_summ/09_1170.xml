<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWCA 392">8 Mr Rushton relied on the cases of Coward v Allen [1984] FCA 53 ; (1984) 52 ALR 320 and Zang v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police [2009] FCA 1170 ; (2009) 260 ALR 580. The former case concerned search warrants, and as I understand it, the issue raised in the interlocutory proceedings dealt with in that case was whether the defendant could examine items already seized under a warrant, the exercise of which was under challenge. As I understand it, there was no threat of a further trespass in reliance of challenged search warrant. In that case it was held that the balance of convenience did not favour restraining the police from examining the items that had already been seized. In Zang there was reference made to Coward v Allen . As I understand it, the question was a rather similar one, and in that case, injunctive relief was granted. </sentence>
