<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1565">There have now been three judgments of the Court in respect of contraventions of s 16 (among other provisions) of the Spam Act . They are, Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377 per Nicholson J; Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (No 4) [2009] FCA 1225 ; (2009) 261 ALR 326 per Logan J; and a further ex tempore judgment by Logan J on 16 December 2009 concerning further respondents in the Mobilegate litigation ( Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd (No 6) [2009] FCA 1533). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1533">Another factor which I took into account in the ACMA v Mobilegate (No 4) judgment is that articulated by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity 1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377 (Clarity1) at para 43. By reference to other authorities, his Honour observed that, while he accepted that the issue of capacity to pay is a relevant factor, it is one "of less importance when balanced against the necessity of imposing a penalty that satisfies the objective of general deterrence". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1225">There is but one directly applicable authority in respect of the Spam Act and the imposition of penalties under that Act. That is a judgment delivered by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377 (Clarity1). One finds, with respect, in his Honour's judgment in Clarity1 a very helpful collation indeed of relevant principle. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1545">26 Also of general relevance to most (if not all) civil penalty provisions is the significance that a pecuniary penalty may have for deterrence upon both the current offender and others: cf Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1990) ATPR 41-076 ; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v D M Faulkner Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1666 at [53] per Bennett J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Gullyside Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1727 at [34] per Kiefel J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v High Adventure Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 247 at [11] ; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 21 at [15] per Goldberg J. A " civil penalty ", it has been said, " needs to be sufficiently high to deter contravention by others, but not so high as to be oppressive ": Vivian v Fitzgeralds [2007] FCA 1602 at [29] per Logan J. An apparent limited capacity of a respondent to pay cannot mitigate against the need for an appropriate pecuniary penalty to be applied: Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1399 at [41] , [2006] FCA 1399 ; 155 FCR 377 at 386---7 per Nicholson J. See also: Beaton-Wells C, 'Recent corporate penalty assessment under the Trade Practices Act and the rise of general deterrence' (2006) 14 CCLJ 65 ; Yeung K, 'Quantifying Regulatory Penalties: Australian Competition Law Penalties in Perspective' [1999] MelbULawRw 18 ; (1999) 23 Melb Univ L Rev 440 (particularly at 468---74).  In a case where the breach of the Act is an attempt to induce a reseller to impose a minimum price for goods supplied to the reseller, the question of loss or damage will rarely, if ever, arise. The Act does not distinguish in terms of culpability between the various types of conduct which constitute the practice of resale price maintenance. The same conclusion was also reached by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1399 at [29] , [2006] FCA 1399 ; 155 FCR 377 at 384 when considering s 24(2) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) . The same conclusion should also be reached in respect to s 42Y(3) of the 1989 Act now under consideration. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1530">11 The Act prescribes a cap on pecuniary penalties, namely:
 
&#8226; in relation to a body corporate;
 
 o in the case of a contravention of subs 68(1) or (2) or 101(1) or (2) --- $10 million for each contravention;
 
 o in any other case --- $250,000 for each contravention (s 570(3)) ;
 
&#8226; in relation to a person other than a body corporate --- not more than $50,000 for each contravention (s 570 (4)). 12 In addition to the factors prescribed by s 570(2) , factors the Courts have taken into account in imposing pecuniary penalties include:
 
&#8226; the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended;
 
&#8226; whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level;
 
&#8226; whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act ;
 
&#8226; whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention;
 
&#8226; the financial position of the contravenor and the capacity to pay;
 
&#8226; the penalty imposed must be substantial enough that the relevant party realises the seriousness of its conduct and is not inclined to repeat it;
 
&#8226; although the penalty should achieve the object of general deterrence, it must not be so high as to be oppressive.

 Pecuniary Penalties --- application of principles 
 
13 Considering the facts of this case in light of factors which should be taken into consideration, I make the following observations:
 
&#8226; The conduct of the first respondent as described earlier in this judgment represents multiple breaches of the service provider rules under the Act , including improper imposition of fees, failures to comply with the TIO scheme, and failures to comply with specified directions of the applicant. It is not in dispute that the second respondent, in his role as sole director, shareholder and Chief Executive Officer of the first respondent, was knowingly concerned in or party to the conduct of the first respondent and aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contravening conduct of the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 616">Mr Cross indicates that Transpacific admits it breached its obligations under clause 29(ii)(a) and (b) of the Award by failing to notify and discuss with the Union the changes which would have a "significant effect". Mr Cross submits that when awarding a penalty this Court should consider the totality of the conduct rather than adding the two contraventions, see Australian Communication &amp; Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 at [46] where Nicholson J made the following comments on the totality principle: [46] The totality principle requires consideration of the appropriateness of a pecuniary penalty having regard to the totality of the conduct rather than simply by the addition of each individual contravention: ACCC v Leahy at 285---286 per Merkel J and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd (ACN 008 274 020) (No 1) (2004) ATPR 42-022 at 49,081 per Lander J. There are two aspects of this matter which attract the operation of that principle. First, there is the high volume of contraventions rendering the conduct at the high end of the scale and arguably likely to attract close to the maximum penalty. The applicant concedes that the maximum penalty provided under the Spam Act would be extreme given all of the circumstances. Second, every time the respondents contravened s 16(1) or s 16(9) of the Spam Act they also contravened s 22(1) and s 22(3) meaning that there was a degree of overlap from the same conduct in relation to contraventions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 130">1 By orders made on 27 October 2006 ( Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2005) 155 FCR 377) , the Court ordered, amongst other things, that:
 
 1. the first respondent, Clarity1, pay to the Commonwealth of Australia a pecuniary penalty pursuant to s 24(1) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) in the amount of $4.5 million; and</sentence>

 23. Mr O'Grady for the Office contends that the Court should determine the penalty based on the totality principle. This requires consideration of the appropriateness of a pecuniary penalty having regard to the totality of the conduct rather than simply by the addition of each individual breach ( Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity 1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 at [46] ). Merkel J referred to this principle in Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Lotus Cove Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 43 at [44-45] : 
 
 
 44 In the present case, the question of penalties should not be approached with the primary emphasis being placed on the number of breaches, even taking into account s 178(2)of the Act. The award is unusual in that it establishes a complex scheme to prevent avoidance of its terms.</sentence>
