<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 113">Although the above authorities apply to the decisions of a tribunal, they may be applied by analogy to ministerial decisions. In Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts and Others [2008] FCA 399 ; [2008] FCA 399 ; (2008) 167 FCR 463 , North J said at [123]: 
 
 The mere fact that not every issue was addressed in the statement of reasons or in departmental advice contained in departmental briefs does not prove that the material was not considered by the Minister. There are other explanations for the absence of mention of the matters in the statement of reasons. The Minister may have excluded some on the basis that they were not sufficiently important, or that the environmental concern was not sufficiently in question to warrant express mention. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 330">Perhaps the strictest formulation of the test is that propounded by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] 1 AC 374 at 410. His Lordship held that the unreasonableness ground of judicial review "applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it. " Judges of this Court have preferred to frame the test in terms which are somewhat less vehement: see, for example, Commonwealth v Pharmacy Guild of Australia (1989) 91 ALR 65 at 87; Alexandra Private Geriatric Hospital Pty Ltd v Blewett (1985) 7 FCR 341. Some judges have quoted with approval and applied Lord Diplock's alternative formulation in Bromley London Borough Council v Greater London Council [1983] 1 AC 768 at 821 where his Lordship said that, in order for a challenge under the unreasonableness ground to be made out, it must "be shown that in reaching the decision the body exercising the discretion has acted on an erroneous view of the applicable law; and decisions that, looked at objectively, are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them. ": see Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 399 ; (2008) 167 FCR 463 at 487 [102] (per North J). Although these formulations of the test for unreasonableness differ in their stringency, they make clear that it will be a rare case in which an unreasonable exercise of discretionary power will be made out. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1106">7 The case ultimately concerned three grounds of argument. The first ground was whether the Minister had failed to take into account the principles of ecologically sustainable development, or had failed to do so correctly, in view of the statute: see Blue Wedges [2008] FCA 399 at [65] . That argument was rejected at [71] by a reading of the statement of the Minister's reasons. There was at least on that basis no question of the construction of the Act, but merely a reading of the decision against the words of the Act. The second basis upon which the argument was rejected was that if the Minister had determined the issue globally, then such an approach was within the purview of the meaning of the Act. This argument was again resolved against the applicant on the basis of a fairly obvious reading of the statute. Although it was a novel question, it was not one which was of sufficient difficulty or complexity to take the case out of the ordinary rule. 1 On 28 March 2008, the Court dismissed an application brought by Blue Wedges Inc to challenge the decision of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (the Minister) to approve the channel deepening project involving the dredging of Port Philip Bay: Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 399 ( Blue Wedges ). The respondents, being the Minister, the Port of Melbourne Corporation (PMC) and the State of Victoria, have sought costs on the basis that they were successful in resisting the application. The ordinary rule is that costs follow the event, and would thus entitle the respondents to their costs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] NSWLEC 182">62 The Andersons have failed to establish any of the grounds relied upon to challenge the Director-General's decision to approve the application for consent under s 90 of the Act. It is important to emphasise that the Court was not called upon to decide whether it would have granted the application for consent. The Court has a limited function. It can only consider challenges to the process by which the Director-General's decision was made and whether the Director-General acted in accordance with the law: Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 399 ; (2008) 157 LGERA 428 at [129] - [131]. That is, the Court is not permitted to review the merits of the Director-General's decision.</sentence>
