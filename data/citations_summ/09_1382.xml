<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 14">BRIT conceded at first instance that it had taken adverse action against Mr Barclay in three respects, namely by suspending him from duty, suspending his access to the internet and requiring him not to attend the premises of BRIT. The fourth form of adverse action alleged was requiring Mr Barclay to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him. This was not conceded and the primary judge did not determine whether it was adverse action. His Honour did refer to a conflict of authority on the question whether being liable to investigation or disciplinary proceedings can constitute a sufficient alteration of the position of an employee to that employee's prejudice to amount to adverse action. The relevant authorities are: Kimpton v Minister for Education of Victoria (1996) 65 IR 317 ; United Firefighters' Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board [2003] FCA 480 (2003) 198 ALR 466 at [89] ; Police Federation of Australia v Nixon [2008] FCA 467 (2008) 168 FCR 340 at [46] - [48]; and Jones v Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre Ltd [2009] FCA 1382 at [23] - [27]. It would also be necessary to consider whether, even if requiring an employee to respond to disciplinary proceedings does not amount to adverse action, it might constitute threatening to take adverse action which, by virtue of s 342(2)(a) of the Fair Work Act , is itself adverse action. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 799">I accept that Ms Quinn's suspension from her employment is likely to have had a substantial impact on her reputation and that it may impose a stigma that adversely affects her future career prospects: Paras at [29] and [48]; Jones v Queensland Tertiary Admission Centre Ltd [2009] FCA 1382 at [27] and Foster at [46]-[47] and [54]. Much of the loss of reputation has probably been caused by the first suspension but nevertheless, I accept that the new suspension is likely to continue to harm Ms Quinn's reputation and her future career prospects. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 399">On 25 November 2009 I made interlocutory orders restraining QTAC from taking any action against Ms Jones until the hearing of the substantive application filed in these proceedings: Jones v Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre Ltd [2009] FCA 1382. Background facts to these proceedings are outlined in Jones [2009] FCA 1382 at [13] - [14] and in the Agreed Chronology filed 1 February 2010. In summary, QTAC processes student applications in Queensland for admission to undergraduate and diploma courses offered by tertiary institutions in that State, as well as applications to some tertiary institutions interstate. It is not in contention that members of QTAC are tertiary institutions, the majority of which are located in Queensland. Ms Jones, who is the Chief Executive Officer of QTAC, has been the subject of serious bullying allegations by individual employees of QTAC and the Australian Services Union ("ASU"). The members of QTAC wish to hold a general meeting to consider an independent report, commissioned by the Chair of the QTAC Board of Directors, investigating those allegations (a report entitled "Report on Grievances against CEO, QTAC" dated 28 September 2009 produced by Ms Carol Watson, hereinafter referred to as "the Carol Watson Report"). My interlocutory orders of 25 November 2009 currently prevent the holding of this meeting or other action against Ms Jones by QTAC in reliance upon the Carol Watson Report or other documentation identified in those orders.  Further, as I observed in the interlocutory judgment: The terms of Ms Jones' employment contract allow QTAC to terminate her employment at three months notice for any reason whatsoever or for no reason whatsoever. There is no specific term in the contract entitling Ms Jones to natural justice in respect of termination of her employment. I do not consider that a term as to natural justice can be implied into Ms Jones' contract of employment on its written terms ( Jones [2009] FCA 1382 at 37-42).  On 25 November 2009 I made interlocutory orders restraining QTAC from taking any action against Ms Jones until the hearing of the substantive application filed in these proceedings: Jones v Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre Ltd [2009] FCA 1382. Background facts to these proceedings are outlined in Jones [2009] FCA 1382 at [13] - [14] and in the Agreed Chronology filed 1 February 2010. In summary, QTAC processes student applications in Queensland for admission to undergraduate and diploma courses offered by tertiary institutions in that State, as well as applications to some tertiary institutions interstate. It is not in contention that members of QTAC are tertiary institutions, the majority of which are located in Queensland.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 284">Given the concessions, properly made by BRIT in relation to the taking of adverse action, it will only be necessary to determine whether or not the institution of the disciplinary proceedings also constituted "adverse action", if it later becomes necessary to consider the award of compensation to Mr Barclay. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that three members of the Court, in the course of interlocutory judgments, have held that the commencement of disciplinary proceedings arguably amounts to the taking of adverse action: see Kimpton v Minister for Education of Victoria (1996) 65 IR 317 at 319 (per North J); United Firefighters' Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board (2003) 123 IR 86 at 110-111 (per Goldberg J); Jones v Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre Ltd (2009) FCA 1382 at [26] --- [27] (per Collier J). On the other hand, in another interlocutory judgement, Ryan J held, in Police Federation of Australia v Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 at 355-6, that the resumption of a disciplinary investigation into allegations against a police officer did not amount to an alteration of that officer's position because "alteration" required a substantive change in, or reduction of, the advantages enjoyed by the employee in that capacity. </sentence>
