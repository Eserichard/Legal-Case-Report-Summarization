<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1373">I have referred already to the requirements of s 76(1) and to the considerations it includes amongst matters relevant for the Court to have regard to in determining an appropriate pecuniary penalty. I need not repeat them. Additionally, a considerable body of authority has enlarged upon the principles governing the imposition of pecuniary penalties. Those principles were helpfully distilled by Kenny J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v TEAC Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1859 at [16] . Her Honour there said: 
 "The relevant principles governing the imposition of pecuniary penalties are discussed in Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 at [60] - [75]; Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,151-52, 154; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Consumer and Competition Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1997) 71 FCR 285 at 290-295; J McPhee &amp; Son (Aust) Pty Ltd v Australian Consumer and Competition Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532 ; and Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 at [51] - [58]. These authorities indicate that further relevant matters include: 

 
 (a) the size of the contravening company; 

 
 (b) the degree of power the company has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market; 

 
 (c) whether the conduct was systematic, deliberate, or covert; 

 
 (d) the period over which the conduct occurred; 

 
 (e) the effect on the functioning of the market and other economic effects of the conduct; 

 
 (f) whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level; 

 
 (g) whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and discipline, or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; and 

 
 (h) whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 2061">126 It seems to me that these difficulties inform the approach which Spender J took in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Jurlique International Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 79. The effect of what his Honour said at [109] --- [111] is that the Court should only depart from the penalties agreed by properly informed and legally assisted parties where it is clear that it should do so.
