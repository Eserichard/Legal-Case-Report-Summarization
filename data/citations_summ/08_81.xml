<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 118">6 The learned primary judge found against the appellant. His Honour held that what was supplied to the purchasers of the apartments had to be identical in juridical terms to that which it acquired: Brady King Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 81 at [29] . On the appeal the Commissioner does not support that view (and did not below). Rather, the Commissioner contends that the appellant did not hold or acquire the "parent" property by 1 July 2000.
