<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 368">A convenient starting point is the judgment of French J (as his Honour then was) on 7 September 2006 ( Austal Ships Pty Ltd (ACN 079 160 679) v Thurlow [2006] FCA 1219). As can be seen from that judgment, Austal manufactures high speed ferries including catamarans and trimarans. It competes in an international market. One of its major competitors is Incat. Incat's principal ship building facilities are located in Tasmania.  Finally, Austal stresses that the email from Mr Craig Clifford (Mr Bob Clifford's son) of Incat to Mr Rothwell, Chairman of Austal of 21 June 2006, although stated to be 'without prejudice' has been waived in respect of privilege for the all the respondents. That document has already been identified as being a document of key significance according to the decision of French J ( Austal Ships v Thurlow [2006] FCA 1219) in relation to preliminary discovery.  In June 2003, Austal contracted for the design and construction of a 126 metre trimaran, vehicle passenger ferry for a European ferry operator Fred Olsen SA. As was observed in Austal Ships v Thurlow [2006] FCA 1219 , at that time the high speed vehicle passenger ferry market had been dominated by catamarans and the use of trimarans was a relatively new concept in that market. Austal's internal research was contained in a report entitled 'Analysis of the Ship Motion Performance of an Austal 101 metre Catamaran and a Comparison with a 126 metre Trimaran in the Irish Sea' (the first Report). As indicated above, the first Report reached the conclusion that the trimaran was significantly inferior to the catamaran on the routes and conditions to which it referred. The first Report and the follow up reports were stored in a computer archive within Austal. The document was strictly an internal and confidential document of Austal. In fact it transpired, according to Austal, that both the conclusion and the basis for it in the first Report were quite erroneous. In a subsequent report, the error was explained and the conclusion in the first Report was corrected.  In September 2006 in Austal Ships v Thurlow [2006] FCA 1219 , French J granted preliminary discovery to Austal pursuant to O 15A rr 3 and 6 of the Federal Court Rules .  The text of the offending email attaching the first Report and sent by Mr Thurlow is set out in Austal Ships v Thurlow [2006] FCA 1219. In particular, it observed that it was well known in the market that the Austal 101 is ' far inferior to the Incat 98 metre in terms of sea keeping, yet in this Austal report the Austal 101 comes out significantly better than the trimaran which is around 26 metres longer on the waterline ...'.

 (b) the nature of the foreshadowed proceeding is a relevant factor to take into account in deciding whether all reasonable inquiries were made: Legent (1992) (unreported, Federal Court, Lockhart J, No G134 of 1992, 13 July 1992) at 7. Where the action is for breach of confidence and infringement of copyright, a letter before action may not have obtained information of the kind and width for which the processes of discovery make provision. 


 
 (c) such a proceeding may create circumstances of urgency when there is a potentially serious breach of an obligation of confidentiality and unauthorised reproduction of a sensitive internal report: Austal Ships Pty Ltd v Thurlow [2006] FCA 1219 at [40] per French J. 


 
 (d) the provision does not contemplate an order where some reasonable inquiries have been made but rather where all reasonable inquiries have been made. It appears to contemplate a reasonable exhaustion of alternative sources of information and, in any particular case, involves a pragmatic balancing of considerations: CGU Insurance Ltd v Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Berhad [2001] FCA 1223 ; (2001) 187 ALR 279 at [25] per Tamberlin J.</sentence>
