<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 803">I heard this matter in Darwin on 25 and 26 March 2009. Soon after I reserved my decision in this matter, two judges delivered three decisions on similar and, in some cases, identical, factual and legal issues. They were: SS v Australian Crime Commission (2009) 256 ALR 474 ; [2009] FCA 580 (" SS ") per Jagot J, delivered on 29 May 2009; AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission (2009) 178 FCR 171 ; [2009] FCA 642 (" AA1 ") per Besanko J, delivered on 22 June 2009; and GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759 (" GG ") per Besanko J, delivered on 20 July 2009. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 553">It was also submitted that, in any event, his Honour was correct in the views which he expressed in AA [2009] FCA 642 and in GG [2009] FCA 759.  This argument was accepted by Besanko J in AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 642 and in GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759. In the former case, at [62]---[64], his Honour said: The applicant submits that s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act is not engaged by s 7B(3) and s 7E of the ACC Act because the reference to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in s 7B(3) is not a mention or reference to a person holding or occupying a particular office or position in general terms. The submission is that a mention or reference in an Act to, for example, a director of a company or an officer of an organisation would be a mention or reference in general terms, but a mention or reference to an office occupied by one person is not a mention or reference in general terms . In proceedings SAD 64, SAD 65, SAD 66 and SAD 67 of 2009, on 11 June, 15 June and 18 June 2009, Besanko J heard applications in which the applicants in those proceedings sought interlocutory injunctions restraining the respondents from conducting the examinations contemplated by the summonses issued to those persons. In a judgment delivered on 22 June 2009, his Honour refused to grant the injunctions sought ( AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 642). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 4">90 It should also be noted that in AB counsel for the ACC conceded that the content of the obligation in s 29(1A) was informed by s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) (which obliges a decision-maker required to give written reasons for a decision to "set out the findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based"). In this case the respondents made no such concession but asserted --- correctly in our opinion --- that s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act was not engaged by the obligation under s 29(1A) since that requires the examiner to record, but not to 'give', written reasons for the decision. That this is the correct approach is confirmed by decisions about the analogous provision in s 28(1A) of the Act: see Barnes v Boulton [2004] FCA 1219 ; (2004) 139 FCR 356 ; SS v ACC [2009] FCA 580 at [90] ; AA v Board of the ACC [2009] FCA 642 at [30] ; GG v ACC [2009] FCA 759 at [45] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1027">A similar argument was put in two matters I heard earlier this year. I rejected the argument. I take the liberty of repeating what I said in AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 642 at [45] - [48]: 
 
 "The applicant submits that a person otherwise given the summons within the terms of s 29A(3) includes a person given the summons, not only by the Commission or an examiner, but by a person served with the summons, or by a person who has been given the summons by a person who in turn has received the summons from the person served with the summons. The applicant submits that if this proposition is correct then it follows that the Statement should set out the obligations and rights in s 29B(3) and (4) either because the words 'otherwise given, a summons' in s 29B(1) have a different meaning from the same words used in s 29A(3), or because a person 'otherwise given, a summons' can fall within the terms of both s 29B(1) on the one hand and s 29B(2) and (4) on the other. 
 

 
 
 The respondents submit that the Act creates two classes, namely, a class of persons served with a summons or otherwise given a summons by the Commission or an examiner, and a class of persons to whom disclosure is made by a person in the first class or by a person otherwise in the second class. It seems to me that there are arguments on both sides. In support of the applicant's submission, it can be said that the examiner must reach a state of satisfaction before issuing the summons and there is no reason to think that he or she could or should not record in writing his or her reasons at the same time. In support of the respondent's submission, it can be said that there is no obligation on the examiner to give reasons to the person summoned and that, as the record in writing referred to in s 28(1A) performs the function identified by Finn J in Barnes v Boulton [2004] FCA 1219 ; (2004) 139 FCR 356 at 363-364 [28] - [29], there is no reason to require the record to be made before the summons is issued. (See also my discussion in AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 642 at [26] - [30]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 759">I reject this submission for the same reasons I rejected the same submission in AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 642 (" AA "). In that case, I said (at [45]-[48]): 
 "The applicant submits that a person otherwise given the summons within the terms of s 29A(3) includes a person given the summons, not only by the Commission or an examiner, but by a person served with the summons, or by a person who has been given the summons by a person who in turn has received the summons from the person served with the summons.
