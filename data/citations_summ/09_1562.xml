<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 625">It has been held that it is at least open, as a matter of law, to a decision maker applying the ASCO code when determining whether someone has a skilled occupation, to consider both the tasks listed for that occupation, and also the extent to which another classification in ASCO appears more suited to the tasks performed by the visa applicant (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Kamruzzaman [2009] FCA 1562 at [64] and [69]). Some occupations might need close examination of skills or tasks rather than lead statements, when the classification is made. However, in my opinion, an application of the ASCO classifications does not, in all cases, require the focusing of the assessment upon the 'tasks' parts of the definition. In the present case, the 'lead statements' provided an equally relevant, and clearer, distinction between the two occupations addressed by the delegate and the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] MRTA 30">The facts of the present case are similar to those considered in the recent decision of Minister of Immigration and Citizenship v Kamruzzaman [2009] FCA 1562 (Greenwood J 23 December 2009) on appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court. In Kamruzzaman, the applicant (Mr Hossain) submitted that, at time of application, he was employed by the Arab Bangladesh Bank as an assistant officer. The applicant claimed his duties extended beyond the responsibilities of a Bank Worker, essentially claiming that he was working as a Business and Information Professional [not elsewhere classified] (the ASCO definition of which is similar to Financial Dealers and Brokers (nec) in that it does not stipulate any specific tasks for the occupation). The Tribunal in Kamruzzaman had found that Mr Hossain's duties in that case were most closely akin to the ASCO description of a Bank Worker. </sentence>
