The bankruptcy notice was served on 10 October 2009, but its time for compliance was extended by a series of Federal Court orders culminating with an order of Edmonds J on 18 December 2009. His Honour dismissed Mrs Coshott's application to set aside the bankruptcy notice, but exercised an independent power to extend the time for compliance (see Coshott v Barry [2009] FCA 1521 , (2009) 7 ABC(NS) 489). He ordered: The time for compliance with Bankruptcy Notice NN4442/09 by the applicant be extended until the day on which final orders are made in proceeding No. 2872/09 in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney. </sentence>
