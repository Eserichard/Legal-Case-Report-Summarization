<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] SASC 19">Looking at the affidavit of 28 May 2007 in the context of the current proceedings, there are a number of additional reasons as to why that application and the accompanying affidavit amount, in my view, to the institution of vexatious proceedings. The most obvious being that the application of 5 November 2007, together with the content of its accompanying affidavit of 28 May 2007, was a further attempt by Mr Garrett to re-litigate issues which had already been determined in the Federal Court by Finn J in Garrett v Fosters Wines Estates Ltd. [235] As indicated earlier in my reasons, Mr Garrett sought to act in a number of different capacities and sought to set aside the Asset Sale Agreement, being the same subject matter as contained in the affidavit of 28 May 2007. Similar to matters raised before Finn J, the affidavit alleged that the sale agreement was "under-value, not commercial and was not in the best interests of the company". [236] There were also allegations about oppression of interests and breach of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) by various directors.  Whilst I will not endeavour to comment on each proceeding instituted by Mr Garrett in the Federal Court, I will make the following observations. In the course of the 21 actions, at least 20 proceedings instituted by Mr Garrett in the actions were dismissed, struck-out or refused. Reasons were published for the majority of these decisions, and within these reasons the proceedings instituted by Mr Garrett are described, inter alia , as "hopelessly misconceived", [227] "incoherent", [228] "embarrassing", [229] "vexatious", [230] "ostensibly untenable" [231] and as having "no reasonable prospect of success".

In the Federal Court proceedings in Garrett v Foster's Wines Estates Ltd, [64] Mr Garrett, purporting to act in a number of different capacities, sought to set aside the Asset Sale Agreement between the Wine Company Pty Ltd, Mildara Blass and Suntory Australia Pty Ltd. The application also sought an order that FWE pay to Andrew Morton Garrett&reg; in his capacity as Trustee of the AGFT No 3 the monies that would have been due under the Garrett Family Licence. The Asset Sale Agreement lay at the heart of the circumstances giving rise to the Deed of Settlement.  In the course of his reasons, Finn J referred to the Deed of Settlement entered into between FWE and other parties on 26 July 2000. His Honour noted that there was significant reference to this Deed of Settlement in the Statement of Claim, but indicated that Mr Garrett had accepted during the course of the hearings that the Deed of Settlement was not in issue in the proceedings before him. [65] Nonetheless, Finn J noted that the documentation relied on by Mr Garrett with regard to the application sought "impermissibly, but irrelevantly for present purposes, to attack collaterally the leave given in the Supreme Court of Victoria.
