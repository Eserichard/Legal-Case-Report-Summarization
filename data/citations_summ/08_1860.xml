<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 453">In Champagne View Pty Ltd v Shearwater Resort Management Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 214 at [47] , Gillard J said that, whilst he would not go as far as Finkelstein J "in stating that any other order other than each party bear its own costs can only be made "in special circumstances", "[a]s a general proposition if there is no other material before the court other than the pleadings then it would be extremely difficult to make any order other than each party bear its own costs". His Honour went on to observe (at [49]) that whilst "evidence may be adduced which establishes with some degree of certainty the likely outcome of the trial", such "evidence must be confined and not venture into areas of disputed fact". In Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Kyriackou [2008] FCA 1860 , Finkelstein J in fact agreed with this last-mentioned proposition, adding (at [10]): 
 
 It is a very sensible rule that where an action has been settled or is to be discontinued that costs should be determined without a trial. Not only is the trial hypothetical, in the sense that there is no longer a controversy about the substantive issues raised in the litigation, it would be extraordinary wasteful, both of the court's time and the parties' resources, to require a trial solely confined to costs. 
 
  There is no need for a trial to determine the disposition of costs. Indeed, the authorities establish that, where a case has settled or otherwise come to an end, there should not be a trial for the sole purpose of deciding the disposition of costs: see, for example, Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Kyriackou [2008] FCA 1860 at [6] ; Re the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of the Commonwealth of Australia; ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 (' Lai Qin ') at 624; Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 162 (' Chapman ') at [7]; and Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd [1993] FCA 585 ; (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201, where Hill J referred to the previous cases, saying: 
 
 (1) Where neither party desires to proceed with litigation the Court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceedings by making a cost order. 
 

 
 
 (2) It will rarely, if ever, be appropriate, where there has been no trial on the merits, for a Court determining how the costs of the proceeding should be borne to endeavour to determine for itself the case on the merits or, as it might be put, to determine the outcome of a hypothetical trial. This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue. 
 

 
 
 (3) In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate, however, for the Court to determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them. 
 

 
 
 (4) In a particular case it might be appropriate for the Court in its discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior to the commencement of the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation. 
 

 
 
 (5) Where the proceedings terminate after interlocutory relief has been granted the Court may take into account the fact that interlocutory relief has been granted. [Citations omitted. ]

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 253">In aid of their motion, those defendants, on 17 October 2008, served on ASIC a notice to produce. That notice sought all ASIC files brought into existence since the investigation into the defendants' affairs had commenced. As the primary Judge remarked, the notice was "served with the intention of establishing that ASIC's case against the defendants was bound to fail from the outset of the proceeding and that the defendants were accordingly entitled to their costs on an indemnity basis". ASIC applied to set aside the notice to produce. That application was heard on 14 November 2008 by Finkelstein J who, on 9 December 2008, set aside the notice: see Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Kyriackou [2008] FCA 1860. His Honour reasoned that the production of the material which had been sought would lead, not merely to an inquiry into the costs which had been incurred, but to a trial of the action for the sole purpose of resolving the issue of costs, a course deprecated by authorities such as Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of the Commonwealth of Australia; Ex parte Lai Quin [1997] HCA 6 ; [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622: see, especially, per McHugh J, at 624. Referring to Champagne View Pty Ltd v Shearwater Resort Management Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 214 and several authorities which preceded it, Finkelstein J then approved the proposition, advanced by Gillard J in that case, at [49], that evidence in support of an order for costs in a proceeding discontinued before trial "must be confined and not venture into areas of disputed fact". </sentence>
