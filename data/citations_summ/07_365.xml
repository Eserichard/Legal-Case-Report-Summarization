<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 518">Section 87(1A) was introduced into the Native Title Act by the Native Title Amendment Act 2009 (Cth). Prior to the amendment of the Native Title Act in 2009 the requirement that the Court must consider it appropriate to make the determination sought by the parties was contained in s 87(1). Given the identical wording between s 87(1A) and the old s 87(1) in respect of this requirement, the exercise of the Court's discretion pursuant to the s 87(1A) should be taken to import the same principles as those applying to the making of a consent determination of native title under the old s 87(1). The discretion conferred by s 87(1) must be exercised judicially and within the broad boundaries ascertained by reference to the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act, including the resolution of native title disputes by mediation and agreement: Hughes v Western Australia [2007] FCA 365 at [8] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 516">The terms of s 87A(4) of the Native Title Act do not necessarily require the Court to receive evidence, make findings, embark on its own inquiry on the merits of the claim made in the application or even to form a concluded view as to whether the legal requirements for proving native title have been met. It is appropriate for the Court to make orders under s 87A where no evidence of the primary facts substantiating native title has been received if the Court is satisfied that the parties have freely and on an informed basis come to an agreement: Brown v Western Australia at [23]-[24] in respect of s 87A and Hughes v Western Australia [2007] FCA 365 at [9] ; Ward v Western Australia [2006] FCA 1848 at [8] . The exercise of the Court's discretion pursuant to s 87A of the Native Title Act imports the same principles as those applying to the making of a consent determination of native title under section 87: Brown v Western Australia ; Nangkiriny v Western Australia [2002] FCA 660 ; (2002) 117 FCR 6 ; Nangkiriny v Western Australia [2004] FCA 1156 ; James v Western Australia [2002] FCA 1208 ; Hughes v Western Australia and under alternatively s 87 and s 87A ; Brown v Western Australia . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1343">In considering the effect of these words, it is important to identify what it is that s 87(1A) requires the Court to consider appropriate. The wording of the section makes it clear that the question for the Court is whether it is appropriate to make an order in the terms of the agreement reached between the parties. Therefore the central focus of the section is that agreement: Lovett v Victoria [2007] FCA 474 (" Lovett ") at [37]; Nangkiriny v Western Australia (2002) 117 FCR 6 ; [2002] FCA 660 at [8] ; James v Western Australia [2002] FCA 1208 at [4] ; Ward v Western Australia [2006] FCA 1848 at [9] ; Cox v Western Australia [2007] FCA 588 at [12] ; Brown v Western Australia [2007] FCA 1025 at [23] ; Hughes v Western Australia [2007] FCA 365 at [9] ; Kogolo v Western Australia [2007] FCA 1703 at [18] and Eringa v South Australia [2008] FCA 1370 (" Eringa ") at [33]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] NNTTA 179">The second native title party is a prescribed body corporate established following the Federal Court making a determination of native title in favour of the Eastern Guruma People on 1 March 2007 --- Hughes (on behalf of the Eastern Guruma People) v Western Australia [2007] FCA 365.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1334">Numerous decisions of the Federal Court have emphasised that provisions such as s 87 and s 87A of the Native Title Act are designed to facilitate and encourage the resolution of native title claims by agreements between parties. They recognise that the Court adopts a different approach to the task of deciding whether it is appropriate to make a determination reached by agreement, than it brings to the task of deciding if native title should be recognised after a contested hearing. In each case, the definition of native title is the same. The Act requires the Court to set out details of the matters mentioned in s 225 of the Native Title Act in all determinations whether reached by agreement or following a hearing. These decisions make plain that, although there needs to be some foundation upon which the Court can exercise its jurisdiction, in matters in which the parties have reached agreement on the terms of a determination, the Court will have particular regard to whether the agreement has been freely entered into on an informed basis. See for example: Eringa, Eringa No 2, Wangkangurru/Yarluyandi and Irrwanyere Mt Dare Native Title Claim Groups v The State of South Australia [2008] FCA 1370 per Lander J at 33; Nangkiriny v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 660 ; (2002) 117 FCR 6 ; Ward v State of Western Australia [2006] FCA 1848 ; Lovett on behalf of the Gundtjmara People v State of Victoria [2007] FCA 474. If that question is answered in the affirmative, the Court will consider the fact that an agreement has been reached as weighing in favour of the making of the determination of native title: James on behalf of the Martu People v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 1208. It may even be that in some cases, the freely informed agreement will be a sufficient basis for the Court to make such consent orders: Ward v State of Western Australia , North J at [8]; Hughes (On behalf of the Eastern Guruma People) v Western Australia [2007] FCA 365 , Bennett J at [9]. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FCA 1703">The Court's jurisdiction to hear and determine native title applications is specifically provided for by the Act in s 81. This jurisdiction expressly includes the power to make orders by consent pursuant to s 87A. These statutory provisions make it clear that the Court's jurisdiction is enlivened. It should, however, be noted that the agreement in this case relates to part of the land and waters the subject of the Ngurrara application. The making of a determination of native title in respect of part of an application is a matter that falls within both s 87(3) and s 87A of the Act. It follows that the Court may make orders determining that native title exists in relation to Determination Area A while leaving the issues outstanding in relation to Determination Area B for resolution at a later date (Munn (for and on behalf of the Gunggari People) v State of Queensland [2001] FCA 1229 ; (2001) 115 FCR 109 at [6] ). This approach has been taken in a number of cases in Western Australia under s 87 (Nangkiriny v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 660 ; (2002) 117 FCR 6 ; Nangkiriny v Western Australia [2004] FCA 1156 ; James on behalf of the Martu People v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 1208 ; Hughes (on behalf of the Eastern Guruma People) v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 365) and under alternatively s 87 and s 87A ( Brown (on behalf of the Ngarla People) v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 1025). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FCA 1025">5 I congratulate the parties on the agreement they have reached and acknowledge the efforts of the National Native Title Tribunal in assisting the parties. As this Court stated in Hughes (on behalf of the Eastern Guruma People) v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 365 at [5] :
 
 '[s]ettlement of native title claims by agreement is to be welcomed and encouraged. It means that the parties can decide for themselves how best to institute an arrangement that satisfies their respective rights and interests in a way that, as appropriate, recognises the rights and interests of the other parties'. </sentence>
