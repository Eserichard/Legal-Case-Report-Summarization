<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 862">Mr Pignoni submits that s.116(2)(g) brings up a type of action which is personal to the bankrupt in the nature of a personal injury or a role of that nature. Mr Pignoni referred the Court to the decision in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1708 per Collier J which was a decision in respect of a claim concerning a Trade Practices type of breach and the bankrupt in those proceedings was seeking to allege that it was a personal action that fell within s.116(2)(g). In that decision Her Honour referred to a previous judgment of Greenwood J that relevantly indicated that where there is a connection between the personal injury aspect of a matter and a property aspect of a matter it is the property aspect of the matter which vests in the Trustee. If the issues cannot be separated then the Trustee maintains the action. However, if it can be separated then the bankrupt obtains the personal action and the Trustee retains the property action. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1304">26 In Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 1371 , at [36] to [48] Spender J summarily stated his conclusions in respect of proceeding QUD525/2005, having regard to earlier and other proceedings which had been filed in this Court and elsewhere by Mrs Rogers or, as the case may be, Mr Rogers. It is instructive to reproduce his Honour's summary:
 
 
 "36 I have analysed the extensive Statement of Claim in considerable detail. I have had regard to the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434 and the reasons for judgment of Collier J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1708. 
 

... 
 
 
 38 Notwithstanding the voluminous material in the Statement of Claim, the concern of Mrs Rogers in these proceedings as at December 2005 was directed at obtaining orders in relation to property at Fingal in New South Wales, which had been the subject of orders of the New South Wales Supreme Court in the matter 5702/2005. 39 In the proceedings before me, Mrs Rogers alleged that the respondents were seeking to enforce an improperly obtained consent judgment and writ in respect of the Fingal property.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1305">12.10.06 The Respondents in proceeding QUD525/2005 apply for the proceeding to be dismissed or permanently stayed. Justice Spender reserved his decision. 07.12.06 Justice Collier dismissed the balance of proceeding QUD130/2006: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 1708. 15.12.06 Mr Rogers commenced proceeding QUD504/2006 by way of an appeal against Justice Collier's decision in QUD130/2006. 23.02.07 Matter QUD504/2006 dismissed by Justice Greenwood: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 195">2 On 7 December 2006, her Honour Collier J made orders that proceedings QUD130 of 2006 commenced by application filed on 7 April 2006 by the applicant be dismissed and that the applicant pay the costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be taxed if not agreed ( Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1708). Those orders were made consequent upon an application by the respondents by notice of motion that the applicant's proceedings be dismissed or alternatively that the proceedings be permanently stayed. </sentence>
