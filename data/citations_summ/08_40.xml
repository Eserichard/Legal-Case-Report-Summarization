<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 32">In Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop.com.Limited [2008] FCA 40 (at [10]-[14], I outlined what I considered to be the relevant principles, saying: There is of course no doubt about the power under s 56 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) to order an applicant (or a respondent) to give security for costs and also a power to increase the amount of any security ordered to be given. Relevant considerations have been referred to in many cases. Amongst the list of considerations which may be taken into account are the following:
 whether the claim is genuine and has a reasonable prospect of succeeding; whether the party applying for security for costs is attempting to shut down a genuine claim; whether the impecuniosity might have been caused or contributed to by the conduct of the applying party; whether, in the case of a corporation, those standing behind the corporation have made their assets available to fund the costs of litigation and in turn for the benefit that they might receive if it is successful; and whether making the order would frustrate the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1060">10 Had there been a change in the circumstances of the Appellant or any prospect that the Appellant could provide security if further time were permitted, the proceeding may well have been stayed and the time previously ordered extended. The Court undoubtedly has power to vary orders previously made, including a power to vary the time at which security is to be provided: Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 56(3) ; Federal Court Rules , O 28, r 5(2). As to the practice of the Court and the circumstances in which that power may be exercised, in Truth about Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd [2001] FCA 1603 , Hely J observed:
 [11] It is clear from the terms of O28 r5(2) that the Court has power to set aside or vary the original security for costs order. The Court retains jurisdiction, because of the very nature of an interlocutory order, to set aside, vary or discharge it up to the time of the final disposition of the proceedings. However, as McLelland J recognised in Brimaud v Honeysett Instant Print Pty Ltd (1988) 6 ACLC 942 , it would be conducive to great injustice and enormous waste of judicial time and resources if there were no limit on the power of a party to have any interlocutory application or order relitigated at will. Hence the ordinary practice is that an application to set aside, vary or discharge an order of a substantive nature made after a contested hearing in contemplation that it would operate until a final disposition of the proceedings, must be founded on a material change of circumstances since the original application was heard, or the discovery of new material which could not reasonably have been put before the Court on the hearing of the original application. That principle was applied by a Full Court of this Court in Darling Harbourside (Sydney) Pty Ltd v Sanirise Pty Ltd (unreported, Beaumont, Carr, Sackville JJ, 17 May 1996) to an order for the provision of security for costs. The Full Court set aside an order varying an order for the provision of security upon the basis that there had been no material change in circumstances established so as to warrant a variation of the original order.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 423">2 On 30 January 2008 following a contested hearing on 17 December 2007, I gave reasons ( Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop .com.Limited [2008] FCA 40) requiring Capital to pay into Court, by 20 February 2008 security for Adultshop's costs in the amount of $68,000. That was quite a brief timeframe, but the reason it was so was because the matter had already been listed for trial for five days from 28 April 2008. </sentence>
