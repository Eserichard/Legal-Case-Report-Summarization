<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] NSWSC 850">25 The writ of the carrier is directed principally to obtaining an order pursuant to s 29 of the Act pursuant to its claim to be entitled to commence proceedings pursuant to s 15 and s 17 of the Act and in view of the commencement of the Dutch proceedings. The carrier's position was that it was able to seek relief pursuant to s 29 based upon s 15 and s 17 of the Act and in the alternative, seek damages against the cargo based upon its asserted general maritime claim and or maritime lien, without thereby prejudicing its argument that the Court had no jurisdiction, and that if it failed in its objection to jurisdiction, it would, by reason of the issue of the writ, be taken to have submitted to jurisdiction: see Pan Australia Shipping v The Comandate No 2 [2006] FCA 112 , 234 ALR 483 , [48] --- [55] (although the decision of the primary judge that there was in that case an election to abandon a London arbitration was overturned on appeal: see Comandate Marine Corp v Pan Australia Shipping [2006] FCAFC 192 , 238 ALR 457). This position was accepted as correct by REL and Baltship and I will proceed on the basis that it was open to the carrier. Given that I have rejected the attack on the jurisdiction of the Court to hear Baltship's and REL's claims and no forum non conveniens argument has been advanced, and because it was accepted that the Dutch Court has not contractually had jurisdiction conferred upon it (and no other basis for it having jurisdiction was advanced), the application for relief pursuant to s 29 of the Act should be rejected.
