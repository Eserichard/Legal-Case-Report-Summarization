<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCAFC 57">2 The claims for damages were dismissed. His Honour the primary Judge, also ordered that the appellant pay the respondent's costs to be taxed upon an indemnity basis ([2006] FCA 1088).  His evidence about allegedly obtaining credit approval from Connect Credit Union turned out to be unsupported by evidence which he claimed he would produce. ... the mere fact that Mr Kitto [the lending manager of the respondent] says he does not remember anything happening does not lead me to accept Mr Upton's assertion that it did. ' (see Upton v Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1088 at [18] )
 
 (b) '... Mr Upton says that ... on [9 December 2002] Mr Kitto telephoned him to advise him of the pay out figure, and suggested that Mr Upton should "come back with an offer". Mr Kitto denies that he said this, and I am positively satisfied that he did not. ...' (at [19])
 
 (c) 'Mr Upton says that there were various conversations from this time onwards [on and after 1 April 2003] with Mr Kitto during which Mr Kitto said he would recommend to his CEO that Mr Upton's pay-out [said to be an offer of $100,000] would be accepted.</sentence>
