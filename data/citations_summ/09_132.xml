<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] WASCA 76">227 Whilst engaging in conduct, within the meaning of s 52 , includes refraining other than inadvertently from doing an act (and so may include advertently refraining from doing an act for perceived honest or altruistic purposes), the question of whether the conduct is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive is to be determined objectively. A corporation may contravene s 52 even though it acts honestly and reasonably: Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Ltd v Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd [1978] HCA 11 ; [1978] HCA 11 ; (1978) 140 CLR 216 , 228; Parkdale v Puxu (197); Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 , 666. Nevertheless, where advertence involves or reflects a design to deceive, a court will more readily find the conduct misleading and deceptive: Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 [33]; Telmak Teleproducts (Australia) Pty Ltd v Coles Myer Ltd [1989] FCA 272 ; (1989) 89 ALR 48 ; 69; Corporation of the City of Adelaide v Adelaide City Fines Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 132 ; (2009) 253 ALR 417 [110].</sentence>
