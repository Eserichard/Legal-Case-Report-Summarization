<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 259">The calculation of Ms Shanley's ability to earn in the periods covered by the decisions under review is to be taken from the figures provided in her income tax returns, in conjunction with the business records of Generating Business Solutions Pty Ltd, and the Profit and Loss Statements for Ms Shanley trading as Kiku Arts. The calculation is not to equate ' operating loss with ability to earn' . [5] The relevant periods covered by both sets of documents do not correspond with any financial year and will need to be estimated by Comcare. 
 Whether Ms Shanley failed to seek 'suitable employment'?

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 52">61 It is not clear in what sense his Honour used the word "acquiesces". If in the sense of an estoppel, a difficulty may be created by the fact that conduct on the part of the Commissioner cannot operate as an estoppel against the operation of the tax legislation: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Wade [1951] HCA 66 ; (1951) 84 CLR 105 at 117. However we need not pursue this matter, which was not the subject of submissions. We do not know what evidence was available to Meagher JA as to the conduct of the couriers and of the Commissioner that gave rise to an acquiescence on the part of the latter. There was no evidence before the Tribunal of the dealings between the interviewers and the Commissioner in this respect. In its absence we would be unable to determine whether the latter has relevantly acquiesced, and if so, what flows from it in terms of the Commissioner's ability or otherwise to levy SGC on Roy Morgan. More importantly, the present argument was not propounded before the Tribunal. Accordingly, the Tribunal did not err in law in failing to deal with the far-reaching consequences contention: Hussain at [38]-[39]; Comcare v Davies [2008] FCA 393 at [21] ; Chen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1901 ; (2000) 106 FCR 157 at [88] - [90].

His Honour referred to Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Raptis [1989] FCA 381 ; (1989) 19 ALD 726 at 728, where Gummow J said that "some difficulty" must arise "in finding an 'error of law' in the failure in the Tribunal to make a finding first urged in this Court".

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] AATA 567">Mr Warnock submitted that my decision in Robinson v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [11] supports the position of Senior Member Beddoe in Hooper v Comcare [12] . He also says Hooper is at odds with paragraph 37of the Federal Court of Australia decision of Flick J in Comcare v Davies [13] ; and Comcare v Davies (No. 2) [14] . In Davies, His Honour differentiated the High Court case of Timbers v Nelson (supra) from the subsequent High Court decision in Cage Developments v Schubert [15] . Mr Dube referred me to Woodbridge v Comcare [6] where Hill J said that consideration of sections 19(4)(a) to (f) are not exclusive considerations and section 19(4)(g) may reveal other relevant or intervening circumstances. But some technical distinctions should be made. I was also referred to the decision of the High Court in J &amp; H Timbers Pty Ltd v Nelson [7] which was cited in Comcare v Davies [8] . There, the High Court of Australia said "the earning capacity of a man as a worker is measured by the remuneration that is the fruit of his labour, his wages or their equivalent. It is not to be measured by the profits he derives by embarking his capital in a business or by his usual capital equipment in earning money". The relevance of capital invested and return on capital was also referred to by the respondent and the decision of Cage Developments Pty Ltd v Schubert [9] is informative where the High Court held that it was correct to assess compensation "by considering what services the worker actually performed in the business and what those services would have been worth if, instead of serving himself, he had been serving an employer, or, put another way, what he would have had to pay another for those services". That approach was confirmed in Comcare Australia v Leslie Bruce Woodbridge [10] .  The point of distinction was that actual earnings might in some circumstances be regarded as being the same as "ability to earn". That was said to be where the business involved "personal services .....(e.g. the business of a sole plumber or casual gardener) and no significant investment of capital is involved" [16] . Robinson and Hooper also emphasise the point that in self employment, actual net profit may conceal expenditure which might not otherwise be regarded as business expenditure and therefore, net profit is not necessarily the best measure of ability to earn. Those decisions are not inconsistent with the applicant's present position managing his small business in establishing a farm.</sentence>
