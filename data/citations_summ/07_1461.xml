<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 651">See also what was said in SZFJU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1461 per Branson J at [10] (" SZFJU "): "I accept that Tribunals, and particularly lay Tribunals, sometimes assert that there is 'no evidence' on an issue when they mean that, although there is some evidence on the issue, they do not regard the evidence as sufficient to support a particular finding (see, for example A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 227 at [23] - [27] and Wickramasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 30 at [18] ). In every case the meaning intended to be conveyed by the Tribunal is to be determined by reference to the language used by the Tribunal understood in the context provided by the Tribunal's reasons for decision as a whole. In this case, having twice asserted that there was 'no evidence' of a particular character, the Tribunal went on to state that the appellant had not provided 'any information which would support [his] claim other than his own speculative assertion'. I conclude that the Tribunal's language, understood in the context provided by its written reasons as a whole, suggests that the Tribunal intended to convey that there was no evidence at all on the two matters identified by it". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 572">I should note had there been any such need, the Tribunal's finding that there was no evidence before it to satisfy it that the applicant would be unable to avail himself of State protection would probably not have been sufficient to properly address that question. The issue of course is not one of "no evidence", but whether in the Tribunal's view it could be satisfied that reasonable and adequate State protection was available to the applicant. But, as I said, it is not necessary for this Court to consider that issue because simply the Tribunal's earlier clear findings were not attended with any level of doubt to make consideration of the issue of State protection necessary. I should just note in passing too that the Tribunal's reference to "no evidence" is probably a reference to insufficient evidence because there was some evidence in relation to this issue before the Tribunal, and that was the evidence that the applicant himself had put forward by way of his assertions ( SZFJU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1461 at [10] , per Branson J). But as I said, the issue is not one that, in light of the Tribunal's findings, that can assist the applicant today. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 2097">I should just note that I understood the Tribunal's references to "no evidence" as being no evidence beyond the evidence the applicant gave it or insufficient evidence such as to make a finding positive to the applicant. (See SZFJU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1461 at [10] , per Branson J. ) Hearing before the Court
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 1798">I also note what Branson J said in SZFJU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1461(at [10]) , that Tribunals often say such things as "no evidence" when what they really mean is that there was "not sufficient evidence. " But I note that this Tribunal decision does not fall into that category. In fact the Tribunal plainly found (at CB 127): "There is no credible evidence upon which I could find that the applicant stands at serious risk of suffering harm in the reasonably foreseeable future if he returns to China. " 
That is, the Tribunal was unpersuaded by the evidence that had been put before it that the applicant was at risk for a Convention reason if he were to return to China. In all, therefore, ground one in the application is not made out. Ground Two --- Failure to consider claims pursuant to s.91R of the Act
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 1680">8. I should note that I make this distinction because Branson J recently observed ( SZFJU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1461 at [10] ) that tribunals often say things such as "no evidence" when what they really mean is there was not sufficient evidence. It is important that this message go back to the Tribunal as Her Honour's point is a very clear one and one which is instructive for this Court.</sentence>
