<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 576">4 When the matter came before me on 8 February 2007, the respondent opposed the application for an extension of time. However, it appeared to me at that time to be appropriate to grant an extension of time notwithstanding the lack of clarity in the questions of law which were said to be raised by the appeal. I took the view, on that occasion, that the period of delay in filing the application for extension of time was only small and that no real prejudice was occasioned to the respondent (see Lever v Comcare [2007] FCA 99). I directed that the applicant file a notice of appeal, conforming to the requirements of Order 53 of the Federal Court Rules , by 4 pm on 1 March 2007, and I made further directions for the preparation of the matter for hearing. </sentence>
