<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 590">As I also observed in Citrus (No 8) [2008] FCA 1556 , a long --- and non-exhaustive --- list of relevant issues for the Court in considering whether to award indemnity costs can be found in such cases as Colgate-Palmolive v Cussons [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 and InterTAN Inc v DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 54.  In Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 8) [2008] FCA 1556 I discussed in some detail principles relevant to the award of indemnity costs by the Court in appropriate circumstances. A number of those key principles are: the purpose of an order for costs is to indemnify or compensate the person in whose favour it is made, not to punish the person against whom it is made; the usual rule is that costs should be on a party-party basis, but that the Court has a wide and unfettered discretion to award costs on an indemnity basis in appropriate cases in particular circumstances; each case depends upon its own particular facts; indemnity costs can be awarded where it appears that a proceeding is commenced or continued in circumstances where the applicant properly advised should have known there was no chance of success. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 498">In summary, the applicants' argument is: Judgment was given in favour of the first and second respondents in the primary proceedings on 5 September 2008 ( Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 7) [2008] FCA 1364). This notice of motion was filed on 26 September 2008. On 17 October 2008 in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 8) [2008] FCA 1556 all outstanding costs issues were dealt with, and, subject to a number of reserved interlocutory costs, the first, second and third applicants were ordered to pay the costs of the first and second respondents. The orders made on those dates have been entered by the applicants. Other than in the circumstances contemplated by O 35 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules --- none of which are relevant in this case notwithstanding the submissions of the applicants concerning O 35 r 7(2)(e) and (f) --- an order once entered can only be set aside by an appeal court. In conclusion, I note that even had I been prepared to exercise my discretion so as to order non-party costs against Mrs Tracy, I would not have been prepared to order costs against her on an indemnity basis. In Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 8) [2008] FCA 1556 I ordered the applicants to pay the costs of the first and second respondents on a standard basis, for the reasons I explained in that judgment. I need not repeat those reasons here. No satisfactory reasons have been provided by the first and second respondents in relation to Mrs Tracy to distinguish her circumstances from those of the applicants, so as to warrant a departure from the usual approach of the Court to order costs payable on a party-party basis.  In Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 7) [2008] FCA 1364 , delivered 5 September 2008, the background facts to the proceedings are described in detail. In that judgment I ordered that the amended application filed by the applicants on 16 February 2006 be dismissed, and that the cross-claim filed by the first and second respondents on 5 June 2007 be allowed. Subsequently in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 8) [2008] FCA 1556 , delivered 17 October 2008, I ordered that, with the exception of a number of costs incurred by the applicants in relation to interlocutory applications, the applicants pay the costs of the first and second respondents, such costs to be taxed if not otherwise agreed. In so ordering I rejected the claim of the first and second respondents that their costs be paid by the applicants on an indemnity basis. </sentence>
