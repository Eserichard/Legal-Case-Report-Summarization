<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 404">Nonetheless, while I accept in light of Repacholi that a claim in negligence against CASA might well be properly pleaded in the appropriate circumstances, I have substantial doubts, based on the available material, about the viability of a negligence claim in the applicants' particular circumstances. The absence of material facts in the pleading, which I discuss below in connection with the misfeasance claims, means that the precise content of the duty allegedly owed to the applicants remains undeveloped. As pleaded, the duty is currently formulated at an unsatisfactory level of generality: see Pharam-a-Care Laboratories Pty Ltd v Australia (No 3) [2010] FCA 361 at [99] quoting Australian Wool Innovation Ltd v Newkirk [2005] FCA 290 at [24] and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2008] FCA 1623 at [2] . In this regard, I note that the reasons in Repacholi indicate that in that case there was at least some attempt to give content to the alleged duty by reference to an obligation to collect information regarding takeoff procedures: see Repacholi at 108 [57]. This lack of specificity indicates that, in truth, in the applicants' case, the negligence claim against CASA is very largely speculative. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 361">Emphasis is placed by Senior Counsel on behalf of the Applicant on the statement by French J in Charlie Carter that it " does not necessarily follow that a conclusion may not constitute a material fact ". With reference to this statement, Hely J in Australian Wool Innovation Ltd v Newkirk [2005] FCA 290 observed: 
 
 [24] On the other hand, French J has expressed the view that a conclusion may constitute a material fact: Charlie Carter Pty Ltd v The Shop, Distributive &amp; Allied Employees' Assn of Western Australia (1987) 13 FCR 413 ; Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall (Aust) Pty Ltd WAG 83 of 1991, 3 September 1991 (unreported). In his Honour's view, the real issue in a case where an objection is raised that a conclusion only is pleaded is whether the facts are pleaded at too great a level of generality to allow the pleading to serve its intended purpose. Drummond J agreed with that approach in State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 499. ... 
 

 
Reference may also be made to the like comment of Greenwood J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2008] FCA 1623 at [2] that " [n]ot all conclusionary pleadings will be struck out. Whether a pleading ought to be struck out will depend upon whether the facts have been pleaded at too great a level of generality or at too high a level of abstraction ". </sentence>
