<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 54">Those principles were applied by Moore J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 476. In the light of the injunctive order proposed to be made, and in the particular circumstances, I do not think any of those three purposes would usefully be served now by corrective advertising. The public interest is adequately protected by the injunctive order, in effect reinforcing the voluntary action taken by Harris Scarfe. The absence of any identified consumer who suffered loss as a result of the contravening conduct makes it quite unlikely now that corrective advertising would alert any particular consumer to the possibility of a remedy. And I have already indicated the injunctive order itself is to aid in preventing a repetition of the contravening conduct. </sentence>
