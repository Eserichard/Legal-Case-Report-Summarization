<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 505">First, a full search of the Australian Company's records has been undertaken. The Australian Company has done, it seems to me, all that is within its power to do in order to identify affected policyholders likely to have an interest in the scheme. The diligence of the search is a relevant consideration in determining whether to grant a dispensation: Re Calliden Group Ltd [2007] FCA 2019 (" Re Calliden ") at [62]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1598">An intention that might suggest itself is that of making mandatory a consideration that this Court was already at liberty to take into account and has taken into account, namely, the interests of non-transferred (remaining) Australian branch policyholders of the transferor insurer, and existing (continuing) Australian branch policyholders of the transferee insurer, neither of which categories would fall within s 17C's concept of "affected policyholder": see Re Insurance Australia Ltd, above at [25], [70], [75], [76]; Mercantile &amp; General Reinsurance Company of Australia Ltd , above, at [23]; PMI Indemnity Ltd [2005] FCA 1842 at [25] ff; Re Calliden Group Ltd [2007] FCA 2019 at [90] - [91]. Importantly, in no case has the Court had regard to the interests of policyholders of an overseas branch or discussed the desirability of their being considered. In Mercantile &amp; General Reinsurance Company of Australia Ltd, above, for example, Emmett J referred to the effect of a scheme on the Australian branch policyholders of the transferee foreign general insurer, and not the policyholders of its overseas branches. His Honour also said (at [3]) that the non-Australian assets and liabilities of the transferee foreign general insurer could be ignored. Justice Emmett's comment relating to the desirability of legislative amendment to which I referred at [34] above is to be understood against the background of the fact that his Honour took into account the interests of only the Australian branch policyholders of the transferee foreign general insurer. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1357">First, a full search of Westport's records has been undertaken. Westport has no means of compelling brokers/agents to conduct searches on its behalf. Westport has done all that is within its power, and is confident that it has identified every policyholder contained within its own records. The diligence of the search that has been undertaken is a consideration relevant to the decision whether or not to grant a dispensation: Calliden Group Limited in the matter of Calliden Group Limited [2007] FCA 2019 ( Calliden Group Limited ) at [62]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1114">In several cases the Court has confirmed schemes under Div 3A of Pt III of the Act on the basis that the financial interests of policyholders have been adequately protected even though, as a consequence of the implementation of the scheme, there will be a reduction in excess capital or solvency coverage ratio for the policyholders: see Mercantile and General Reinsurance Company of Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 1773 at [19] - [24]; PMI Indemnity Limited (No 2) [2005] FCA 1842 at [71]- [74]; Calliden Group Limited in the matter of Calliden Group Limited [2007] FCA 2019 at [88] - [91]; MMIA Pty Limited and QBE Insurance (Australia) Limited [2008] FCA 1239 at [16] - [18], [32]-[33]; Calliden Limited, in the matter of Calliden Limited [2009] FCA 186 at [12] - [21].  An "affected policyholder" is defined in s 17C(1) of the Act to mean the holder of a policy affected by a scheme, and is the holder of a policy being transferred under the scheme. The Court may, however, take into account, as relevant to the exercise of its discretion, the effect of the scheme on other policyholders, notably the holders of policies issued by the transferee insurer: see Re Insurance Australia Limited [2004] FCA 524 ; (2004) 139 FCR 450 at [19] ; Mercantile &amp; General Reinsurance Company of Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 1773 at [23]; PMI Indemnity Limited (No 2) [2005] FCA 1842 at [25] ; Re Calliden Group Limited [2007] FCA 2019 at [90] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 186">As will shortly appear, there has been no compliance with that provision. However, compliance with s 17C(2) is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to the power of the Court to confirm the scheme arising: see Re Armstrong Jones Life Assurance Ltd (1997) 74 FCR 160 at 162 per Emmett J; Re Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Life Assurance Ltd [2000] FCA 1259 ; [2000] FCA 1259 ; (2000) 104 FCR 37 at 40 per Katz J; Re Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 524 ; (2004) 139 FCR 450 at 461-463 per Lindgren J; MLC Lifetime Company Ltd and MLC Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1367 at [11] per Bennett J; Re Calliden Group Ltd [2007] FCA 2019 at [81] per Lindgren J.  Prior to December 2007 it was thought that it would be desirable for Calliden Group to operate as a non-operating holding company. This would reduce the number of authorised insurers within the group and also free up capital which, so long as Calliden Group was an authorised insurer, was required to be maintained by it. On 15 November 2007, this Court confirmed a scheme transferring Calliden Group's insurance business to Calliden: see Calliden Group Ltd in the matter of Calliden Group Ltd [2007] FCA 2019. From that day, Calliden operated the two former insurance businesses of Calliden Group. However, apart from that augmentation Calliden had its own pre-existing general insurance business. It was incorporated in February 2005 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliden Group. For the year ended December 2007, it had gross written premiums of about $65 million. It wrote policies in a number of areas of general insurance including commercial, public and product liability, sports, leisure and community, construction, commercial and domestic motor, household and niche personal lines but did not write workers compensation or compulsory third party. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1239">24 In exercising my discretion to make the dispensation orders, I took into account the fact that APRA did not object, that the Scheme is between companies in the same Group, and the widespread nature of the advertising: Re Calliden Group Ltd [2007] FCA 2019 at [62] (Lindgren J).
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 636">
 

10 Section 17C sets out those steps which must be undertaken before an application may be " made " for confirmation. For the purposes of s 17C, it is considered that an application for confirmation of a scheme is " made " at that point in time when a hearing is held which seeks confirmation and not at that point in time when proceedings are filed with this Court: Re Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 524 at [30] ---[37] per Lindgren J [2004] FCA 524 ; , 139 FCR 450 at 458---9.
