<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 408">The Minister also makes reference to a number of authorities as to the nature of further evidence that may be received after judgment has been reserved ( Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Ltd (No.2) [2008] FCA 1761 at [12] --- [15], Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Lee v Professional Services Review Committee No 292 (No 2) [2010] FCA 1490 at [2] , BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 389 at [10] , McLaughlin v Dungowan Manly Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 89 at [45] --- [56], Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 837">Customs also visited a number of other exporters of the product affected by the review and analysed various items of confidential information it obtained from them and Qenos as to their businesses as well as their costs and prices. Customs then prepared confidential appendices to Report 134. I have given separate reasons for confidentiality orders that I made during the hearing in respect of this class of information: Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd v Minister of State for Home Affairs (No 3) [2009] FCA 389. Customs found that all relevant information it had considered during the review indicated that prices and costs had increased since the last review. The evidence in the confidential evidence indicated that those increases were significant and substantial. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 404">Three grounds under this section were advanced. These were: 
(a) The Statutory Demand was not made in compliance with s 459E of the Act because it was not in the prescribed form (see s 459E(2)(e) of the Act) and was not accompanied by an affidavit that:
 
(i) Verified that the claimed debt was due and payable by BMG as at 21 August 2007; and
 
(ii) Complied with the Rules of Court. (see s 459E(3) of the Act). The alleged non-compliance with each of the provisions referred to above was said to be constituted by the failure on the part of Adelaide Bank to verify the Statutory Demand or otherwise include in the affidavits read in support of its case on the present Application a statement by an appropriately qualified witness to the following effect:
 
I believe there is no genuine dispute about the existence or amount of the debt. In support of these contentions, Mr Watts relied upon the decision of Tamberlin J in IFA Homeware Imports Pty Ltd v Shanghai Jerrys Candle Company Ltd [2003] FCA 533. (b) The Statutory Demand was issued for an improper purpose. That purpose was said to be the purpose of preventing or delaying BMG, Mr Watts and Mrs Watts from taking action against Adelaide Bank for damages or compensation by reason of the bank's conduct in allegedly dishonouring various alleged agreements and arrangements and in taking possession of the property and in taking steps to sell it as mortgagee in possession; and
 
(c) The amount of the debt claimed in the Statutory Demand was misstated. At the hearing on 10 December 2008, Mr Watts conceded that there was in existence as at 21 August 2007 a debt due from BMG to Adelaide Bank but submitted that the correct amount of the debt due from BMG to Adelaide Bank at that time was $16,281.29. Subsequently, in a submission which I allowed Mr Watts to advance as a result of my decision made on 21 April 2009 (see BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 389) , Mr Watts submitted that no moneys were due from BMG to Adelaide Bank and that Adelaide Bank had an obligation to account to BMG for surplus funds of approximately $86,286.32.
