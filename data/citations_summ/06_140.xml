<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 90">23 However, we will deal with the contention on the assumption there was a need to look to extrinsic evidence to assist in understanding the order. The construction of the order was a matter of law: Universal Musical Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Networks Ltd [2006] FCAFC 41 ; (2006) 150 FCR 110 at 116. It has been held that in considering the effect of orders made by a court, the court can have regard to the reasons for judgment and other surrounding circumstances including the pleadings: Athens v Randwick City Council [2005] NSWCA 317 ; (2005) 64 NSWLR 58. That case does not support the contention that Tracey J was obliged to have regard to the transcript of the hearing before Gray J. In fact, Gray J gave reasons for the orders which he made: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton [2006] FCA 140. Paragraph 11 of Gray J's reasons support the construction of the orders at which we have arrived. In [11] of his reasons, he said:
 It is also appropriate, in my view, to make orders endeavouring to ensure that any assets over which the respondent does have control will be frozen effectively. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCAFC 118">24 On 30 March 2006, Merkel J held, inter alia , that the motions to set aside the orders of Sundberg J, Gray J and Merkel J should be dismissed with costs. In relation to the orders of Sundberg J, Merkel J said at [4]:
 
 "The orders made by Sundberg J were superseded by the orders made by Gray J granting interlocutory injunctions: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton [2006] FCA 140. The orders were first challenged by Siminton by his motion of 14 March 2006, which was well after the original orders were spent. The only apparent purpose of that challenge was Siminton's endeavour to have the orders declared to be a nullity so that they could not found the motion of the applicant (APRA) against him for contempt. For the reasons given (at [42]-[53]) of my reasons for judgment handed down today I have concluded that the challenge to the orders made by Sundberg J is to be rejected. The motion to set aside the orders has been brought too late, is misconceived and is without merit. "

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 326">6 On 10 January 2006, the application by APRA for interlocutory relief was heard inter partes by Gray J. Gray J made orders which, inter alia, restrained Siminton until the trial of the action or further order from receiving money from members of the public by way of deposit in the Terra Nova Cache or the Principality of Camside and from dealing with or disposing of certain assets and moneys: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton [2006] FCA 140. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 336">4 The orders made by Sundberg J were superseded by the orders made by Gray J granting interlocutory injunctions: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton [2006] FCA 140.
