Although there is no authority in this Court directly on point I note that in Ogawa v Phipps [2006] FCA 361 ; (2006) 151 FCR 311 , which concerned a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court, Finkelstein J made an order in the nature of mandamus requiring Phipps FM to order that the proceeding be transferred to the Federal Court. The matter was so transferred and addressed by the Federal Court in Ogawa v Registrar of the High Court of Australia [2006] FCA 607 , though ultimately it was dismissed by consent. </sentence>
