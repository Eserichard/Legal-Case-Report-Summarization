<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1229">On 20 October 2009, I heard submissions from counsel for the second respondent (Sirtex) and the first respondent (Dr Gray) concerning the issues that may be agitated at the hearing of the application of Sirtex for assessment of damages payable by Dr Gray, which hearing is listed to commence on 9 November 2009. The assessment of damages follows the handing down of the primary judgment of French J on 17 April 2008: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 20) (2008) 246 ALR 603 ; 76 IPR 222 ; [2008] FCA 498 ; and the order of French J made 15 August 2008: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 22) [2008] FCA 1315.  On 15 August 2008, following delivery of the principal judgment on 17 April 2008, French J ordered that the assessment of damages in the proceeding be adjourned to another judge at a date to be fixed: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 22) [2008] FCA 1315.  At [2] of his reasons for this order, his Honour explained that the assessment of damages could not be carried out before his resignation from the Court following his appointment as Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia commencing on 1 September 2008. It was therefore necessary that the assessment be done by another judge. His Honour explained that on 15 August 2008 he declined to make declarations or rulings sought by Sirtex by way of declaration concerning the heads of damages it was entitled to recover. French J noted that various categories of loss were proposed subject to a carve out for any expense "caused by the grossly unreasonable conduct of Sirtex itself". </sentence>
