<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 271">My judgment was upheld by Edmonds J (see Jalagam v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 197). His Honour held: 36. There is no requirement in s 494D (or elsewhere) for the notice appointing the authorised recipient to be in any particular form; any notice in writing meeting the elements of subs 494D(1) will suffice. There is no requirement for the notice under subs 494D(1) to be signed at all --- but even if there was a requirement that it be signed by the appellant, there would still be room for application of the presumption that the appellant could meet that requirement through an agent: McRae at 663D. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] MRTA 2586">The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction in this matter. 

James Silva
 
 [1] Jalagam v MIAC [2008] FMCA 1417 (Smith FM, 2 October 2008). This finding, which concerned the interpretation of s.494D, was not disturbed on appeal in Jalagam v MIAC [2009] FCA 197 (Edmonds J, 6 March 2009). AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 380">There must also be a causative relationship between the fraud and the stultification or frustration of the legislative scheme governing the Tribunal's procedures. In Jalagam v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 197 it was alleged that a migration agent's failure to communicate a delegate's decision speedily amounted to fraud. As Edmonds J stated (at [42]): Plainly, SZFDE required not only that there be fraud in the sense of dishonesty, but also that there be a causative connection between that and the Tribunal being 'disabled ... from the true discharge of its imperative statutory functions with respect to the conduct of the review': SZFDE at [51]; such that its decision was, in law, no decision at all: (SZLIX at [18]; also [20]). If the appellant would in any event have been out of time, any dishonesty (assuming, contrary to his Honour's finding, that there was some dishonesty by anyone at Tan &amp; Tan) would not have made any difference. There would be no link between the suggested 'fraud' and the Tribunal's decision-making process: SZFNX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 at [32] and [34] also speaks of this requirement. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] MRTA 1533">Section 494B(4) of the Migration Act 1958 allows the Minister to give the applicant a document by dating the document and dispatching it within 3 working days by prepaid post or other prepaid means to either the last address for service or the last residential or business address provided to the Minister by the recipient for the purpose of receiving documents. Whether a person has provided an address to the Minister for the purposes of receiving documents in s.494B(4) is a question of fact to be determined in each case. It is not necessary for the applicant to have personally provided the relevant address; it is sufficient if another person acting under the applicant's instruction has done so: Jalagam v MIAC [2008] FMCA 1417 upheld on appeal in Jalagam v MIAC [2009] FCA 197. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 324">Mr Reynolds went on to submit that the decisions in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLIX [16] , SZMGX v Minister for Immigration [17] , SZLHP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [18] , Jalagam v Minister for Immigration [19] , and SZHVM v Minister for Immigration [20] , should be distinguished on their facts. </sentence>
