<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 18">The MRT fell into jurisdictional error in making this finding. Specifically: a) There was no evidence on which the MRT's finding was based. (aa) The MRT's finding was irrational, or not based on logically probative material, or not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds: MIEA v Pochi [1980] FCA 85 ; (1980) 31 ALR 666 at 689-690; MIMIA v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 at [37] [38]; SZMDS v MIAC [2009] FCA 210 ; (2009) 107 ALD 361 at [21]- [29]. b) The applicant submitted to the Department pay slips which recorded that he was employed as a "cook": see pages 57 to 60 of the Court Book. The MRT overlooked this evidence. In his updated written submissions, the applicant submitted: In the present case, the applicant contends: a) The Tribunal's finding that ["] the work reference on which TRA's assessment of the applicant was based contained false and misleading information about the applicant's skills and experience as a cook" was not supported by probative material. It may have been supported by speculation by the restaurant manager. Such speculation is not "probative material". b) The Central Finding or inferences of fact on which the Central Finding is based "cannot reasonably be drawn from" the Tribunal's findings of fact. c) The Tribunal, when drawing inferences based on evidence, must act "rationally and logically": SZMDS v MIAC [2009] FCA 210 ; (2009) 107 ALD 361 at [24] . The Tribunal failed to act rationally and logically in drawing inferences based on the restaurant manager's evidence. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 515">On appeal, the Applicant was successful. It was held that the Refugee Review Tribunal had fallen into jurisdictional error because its conclusion about a key issue in the Applicant's case "was based squarely on an illogical process of reasoning...The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error having regard to the way it reached the conclusion" ( SZMDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [27] at [29]-[30]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 97">The claimant to refugee status in SZMDS claimed persecution by reason of his homosexuality. That claim had been rejected by the Minister's delegate and that decision had been affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal. An application to the Federal Magistrates Court was dismissed but an appeal was allowed by a Judge of this Court: SZMDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 , 107 ALD 361. In allowing the appeal, it was said that " [t]he Tribunal's conclusion that the applicant was not a homosexual was based squarely on an illogical process of reasoning " with the result that the Tribunal " fell into jurisdictional error having regard to the way it reached the conclusion that the applicant was not a homosexual ". Special leave to appeal was granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] HCA 16">An application by the first respondent to the Federal Magistrates Court was dismissed but a subsequent appeal to the Federal Court of Australia (Moore J) [61] ("the Federal Court") was allowed on the basis that "the Tribunal's conclusion that the first respondent was not a homosexual was based squarely on an illogical process of reasoning" with the result that the Tribunal "fell into jurisdictional error having regard to the way it reached the conclusion that the applicant was not a homosexual" [62] .
  The reiteration in ss 36 and 65 of the Act of the term "satisfied" is significant for the issues on this appeal by the Minister from the decision of the Federal Court (Moore J) [2] . The Federal Court allowed an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court (Scarlett FM) [3] and quashed the decision of the RRT (the second respondent). Moore J held that the RRT had fallen into jurisdictional error because its determination that the first respondent was not a refugee was based on illogical or irrational findings or inferences of fact [4] and remitted the matter to the RRT to be heard and determined according to law. The RRT had affirmed the decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse the grant of a protection visa to the first respondent. In this Court the RRT entered a submitting appearance. The Federal Court's reasoning and findings on what was headed "[i]rrational and illogical fact finding" included the following [75] :
 
 
 "The Tribunal made no finding about how, during the applicant's brief return to Pakistan, it might conceivably have become known to his family or anyone else that he had become, on his account, a practising homosexual. His claimed fear was based on his apprehension that his family and others in Pakistan might come to know of his homosexuality. However, the Tribunal does not say how that might have emerged during a brief visit when he was the custodian of the information. The second is that the decision maker accepts or is content that the applicant answers or meets that requirement or condition. Upon review by the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the RRT") of a refusal by the Minister (or the delegate of the Minister), the RRT exercises all the powers and discretions conferred by the Act upon the Minister (s 415(1)). The reiteration in ss 36 and 65 of the Act of the term "satisfied" is significant for the issues on this appeal by the Minister from the decision of the Federal Court (Moore J) [2] . The Federal Court allowed an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court (Scarlett FM) [3] and quashed the decision of the RRT (the second respondent). Moore J held that the RRT had fallen into jurisdictional error because its determination that the first respondent was not a refugee was based on illogical or irrational findings or inferences of fact [4] and remitted the matter to the RRT to be heard and determined according to law. The appeal to the Federal Court followed a Federal Magistrate's determination [73] that the Tribunal decision contained no jurisdictional error. In an amended notice of appeal the first respondent claimed that the Tribunal's decision was "unsupported by probative material, and the inference of fact upon which it based its decision could not reasonably be drawn, when it concluded that the appellant's short visit to Pakistan before travelling to Australia cast doubt on whether he engaged in homosexual conduct in the UAE, or that he was genuinely fearful of persecution in Pakistan" [74] .
  As Moore J noted, it was central to the reasoning of the RRT that the first respondent was not a homosexual [13] . Before turning to consider what his Honour held were the defects, fatal to the exercise by the RRT of its jurisdiction, in the inferential reasoning to that conclusion, something should be said of the importance for this case of the doctrine of jurisdictional error, and its constitutional under-pinning. It is the operation of that doctrine which marks this case off from those in which judicial review is attempted for alleged factual error not going to jurisdiction. 
  The account given by the first respondent of his personal history was summarised by Moore J as follows [12] :
 
 
 "In 1991 he married his wife, and had four children from that relationship. In 1995 he travelled from Pakistan to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where he worked in a factory. He returned to Pakistan in 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 285">However, the Tribunal's conclusions were supported by many reasons for disbelieving the claimed history of persecution by the wife's family and police officers at their instigation. It gave many reasons for rejecting various items of corroborative evidence, which were rational and open to it. The criticisms made by the Tribunal of the credibility of the two applicants, as witnesses whose evidence has been taken by it over six hours of hearing, are not shown on the evidence before me to be flawed by such irrationality or unreasonableness which could be characterised in any of the terms which have been suggested to show jurisdictional error (cf. Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 , [2003] HCA 30 , and assuming the correctness of SZMDS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2009) 107 ALD 361 , [2009] FCA 210 pending delivery of the High Court's judgment on appeal). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 236">Assuming that an illogical or irrational process of reasoning to a conclusion of fact may give rise to jurisdictional error (see, for example, SZMDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 ; (2009) 107 ALD 361 , but note that judgment in the Minister's appeal to the High Court is reserved [2009] HCATrans 301 (10 November 2009)), the Federal Magistrate was right to conclude that there was nothing illogical or irrational about the Tribunal's reasoning. The inconsistencies between the appellant's account of his movements and the passport entries provided a logical and rational basis for rejecting him as a credible witness. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 60">The single judgements in SZANI v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [13] and SZMDS v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [14] provide illustrations of the applications of those principles. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FMCA 93">In particular, I am unable to detect the basis for complaining that the Tribunal's decision made illogical findings or findings which were not open to it on a reasonable assessment of the evidence. I do not consider that the material before me raises a ground of jurisdictional error such as was found by Moore J in SZMDS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 , which remains binding upon me, although it is subject to a reserved judgment in the High Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FMCA 90">Grounds 2 and 6 of the amended application appear to challenge the Tribunal's reasoning on grounds of illogicality or unreasonableness. There is current authority binding on this Court that would allow a court on judicial review to find a failure to exercise jurisdiction if a Tribunal presented a justification for its decision which was entirely unpersuasive in articulating a logical and rational basis for an adverse assessment of an applicant's evidence and claims. Moore J in SZMDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 identified relevant authorities, and his judgment is binding upon me while it is under appeal in the High Court. However, I would not characterise the present Tribunal's reasoning as being " based squarely on an illogical process of reasoning " (see SZMDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 at [29] ), nor does it have the character found by Gordon J in SZLGP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1198 as a decision relying only upon minor or trivial inconsistencies or admissions in evidence.  Grounds 2 and 6 of the amended application appear to challenge the Tribunal's reasoning on grounds of illogicality or unreasonableness. There is current authority binding on this Court that would allow a court on judicial review to find a failure to exercise jurisdiction if a Tribunal presented a justification for its decision which was entirely unpersuasive in articulating a logical and rational basis for an adverse assessment of an applicant's evidence and claims. Moore J in SZMDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 identified relevant authorities, and his judgment is binding upon me while it is under appeal in the High Court.

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] FMCA 57">I am not persuaded that there is a foundation supporting Ground 4 in the Tribunal's reasoning about these matters, applying principles identified by Moore J in SZMDS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 , (2009) 107 ALD 361 (in relation to which judgment on appeal is reserved in the High Court). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 1226">For the above reasons, in my opinion, the applicant's criticisms of the Tribunal's reasons individually and collectively fall far short from revealing any irrationality or unreasonableness which could establish jurisdictional error, whether directly under principles referred to by Moore J in SZMDS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 (in relation to which, the High Court has reserved judgment), or indirectly through principles of apprehended bias. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCA 1332">In respect of first ground of the Amended Application, the Federal Magistrate distinguished the present matter from the decision in SZMDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2009] FCA 210 ; (2009) 107 ALD 361. The Federal Magistrate stated that, in the present case, the Tribunal's findings regarding the appellant's credibility formed a rational and logical basis for its conclusions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FMCA 1150">Counsel for the Minister has addressed these grounds with reference to authority in a manner which I would accept. I do not think it necessary for me to repeat her submissions, which can be found on the file, nor repeat the references to all the authorities she cites. The contention in the first ground that the Tribunal's decision was affected by irrationality or illogicality appears to rely on principles which were applied in an exceptional case by Moore J in SZMDS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 with reference to previous authority. That decision is currently under appeal in the High Court, but I am bound to follow the principles identified by Moore J. However, in my opinion, the two matters put in the argument under ground 1 fall far short of establishing any such jurisdictional error in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FMCA 1013">If this was an example of the totality of the Tribunal's approach and the matters it relied on, then jurisdictional error may well have been discerned. (See, for example, SZMDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 210. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FMCA 908">Before the Court the applicant also complained about the Minister's submission in the alternative, that illogicality on its own cannot form the basis for jurisdictional error. Given the finding above, it is not necessary to consider this matter. I note only that in relation to the judgement in SZMDS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 (" SZMDS "), which appears to establish a competing position from the authorities relied by the Minister (at [19] of written submissions), that the High Court has granted special leave to the Minister to appeal against the judgment (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZMDS [2009] HCATrans 183 (31 July 2009) per Hayne and Heydon JJ).

<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FMCA 857">In my opinion, its reasoning is manifestly distinguishable from the situation addressed by Moore J in SZMDS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 210. I note that the High Court has given special leave to appeal from that judgment, but at present I am bound to apply it. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] FCA 842">There is however a question whether a Tribunal decision which lacks rationality and logicality is one that exhibits jurisdictional error. The decision of the Full Federal Court in VWST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 286 holds it is not. However, another line of Federal Court authority suggests otherwise: see for example, SZMDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 , where Moore J, having reviewed a number of recent authorities on this point since 2004, found, at [22] --- [30], that a decision of the Tribunal could suffer from jurisdictional error where it lacked logicality. This issue, I am informed by counsel for the Minister, is now the subject of a grant of special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia in SZMDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 , made 31 July 2009.

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] FCA 814">The Tribunal's findings were open to it on the evidence before it and for the reasons it gave. The findings of the Tribunal were not 'irrational' or 'illogical' in the sense of SZLGP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1198 or SZMDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 , nor were they unreasonable in the sense of Wednesbury unreasonableness (see, for example, Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at [30] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] FCA 576">In his Honour's opinion, the Tribunal's finding with regard to the letters of support was within the category of authorities which has found that there is no failure of procedural fairness or other jurisdictional error in a Tribunal's reasoning where it finds that corroborative evidence did not outweigh credibility concerns in an applicant's own evidence citing SZMDS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2009] FCA 210 ; (2009) 107 ALD 361 and WAKK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 225 at [70] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2009] FMCA 469">If the attack on "subjective assessments" is a contention that the Tribunal's decision was reasoned in such an unreasonable or irrational manner as to show no real or genuine exercise of jurisdiction, then I can find no evidence to support that contention (compare SZMDS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 210 and the cases cited therein). The fact that earlier or different members may have made different factual findings cannot provide, in itself, evidence of jurisdictional error affecting the most recent decision. The applicant has not taken me to any aspect of the earlier decisions which would illustrate or demonstrate irrationality or unreasonableness on the part of the present Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2009] FMCA 268">I have carefully considered the Tribunal's reasoning, and do not consider it is capable of being characterised as lacking a logical foundation, or being perverse, capricious, or manifestly unreasonable within the sense required by authorities to give rise to evidence of jurisdictional error (see Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 , and other authorities recently applied by Moore J in SZMDS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 210). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2009] FMCA 248">In my opinion, the present Tribunal's dealing with the letters of support falls within the line of authorities which finds no failure of procedural fairness or other jurisdictional error in a Tribunal's reasoning which found that corroborative evidence did not outweigh credibility concerns in an applicant's own evidence.
