<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1480">None examined the enactment history of s 51A. If it be thought, contrary to my reading of Keane JA's reasons, that his Honour's reference to Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 as "established authority" was a conclusion that s 51A(2) effected a reversal of the legal and persuasive onus of proof, I would be driven to the respectful view that his Honour was plainly wrong for the reasons that I have given. Perhaps not surprisingly, Emmett J also agreed with Allsop J as to the operation of s 51A(2): [2008] FCA 2 at [6] , 165 FCR at 233---4. The third member of the Full Court, Stone J, considered that the issues thrown up by s 51A(2) were best left to be resolved by a Full Court where there had been full argument and where the outcome depended on the view taken of the section: [2008] FCAFC 2 at [76] , 165 FCR at 247---8. </sentence>
