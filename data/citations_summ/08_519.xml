<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] RRTA 1170">Different interpretations of s 91R(3) have been taken in the Courts, in particular whether the section imports a "sole purpose" test ( SAAS v MIMA [2002] FCA 726 ; (2002) 124 FCR 182 (not disturbed on appeal); SZIAT v MIAC [2008] FMCA 44 (Nicholls FM, 30 January 2008) upheld on appeal and SZIAT v MIAC [2008] FCA 766 (Gordon J, 26 May 2008) at [33]) or a "dominant purpose" test ( SZJZN v MIAC [2008] FCA 519 ; (2008) 169 FCR 1 at [35] ; however, this has been treated as obiter dicta in SZMBL v MIAC [2009] FMCA 44 (Smith FM, 10 February 2009) at [112] (not disturbed on appeal: SZMBL v MIAC [2009] FCA 622 (North J, 22 May 2009)) and SZNAB v MIAC [2009] FMCA 152 (Driver FM, 3 June 2009) at [7]) or where conduct has mixed motives, whether the conduct may not be taken into account either as supporting or as disproving a refugee claim, unless a motive of strengthening the claim is positively excluded ( SZMPJ v MIAC [2008] FMCA 1640). </sentence>

The matter is currently under consideration in the High Court in SZJGV v MIAC and was heard in that court in May 2009. However, in light of the Tribunal's findings in this matter and the fact that the first application for a protection visa was made more than four years ago, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate further to delay the present matter until the High Court hands down its decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 583">In the current case, the Minister's written submissions refer to SZJZN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 519 (" SZJZN" ) per Madgwick J and appear to draw from what was said at [35]: "35 In my opinion the problem referred to can be adequately overcome, and the real mischief that concerned the legislation's framers met, by interpreting "the purpose" as meaning "the dominant purpose". The Second Reading speech gives a sharper account of the mischief the subsection was aimed at than the Explanatory Memorandum and it supports the approach I favour. The context generally speaks against giving the statute an over-literal interpretation. The Minister refers to SZJZN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 169 FCR 1 ; [2008] FCA 519 at [34] to [35] where Madgwick J observed that "the purpose" in s.91R(3) could be interpreted as meaning "the dominant purpose" to reflect the legislature's intention. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 152">The matter came before me for a show cause hearing on 26 February 2009. At that time, my view was that the Tribunal did not err in relation to its application of s.91R(3). In relation to the application of the dominant purpose test, I was guided by the decision of his Honour Madgwick J in SZJZN v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 519 at [35] : In my opinion the problem referred to can be adequately overcome, and the real mischief that concerned the legislation's framers met, by interpreting "the purpose" as meaning "the dominant purpose". The Second Reading speech gives a sharper account of the mischief the subsection was aimed at than the Explanatory Memorandum and it supports the approach I favour.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] HCATrans 103">It is a case called SZJZN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 519 ; 169 FCR 1 and there is some dicta, I think, of Justice Madgwick that suggests that dominant purpose is sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 91">Nor is there any evidence that the applicant claimed a subjective fear of persecution in China by reason of his alleged practice of Falun Gong in Australia. Accordingly, the first respondent submits that the alleged Falun Gong practice in Australia did not engage s 91R(3) and therefore this section did not require the Tribunal to make a finding of fact, or a finding as to the applicant's motives, in relation to it. Discretion to refuse relief If, contrary to the above submissions, the Court finds that the Tribunal breached s 91R(3) , the first respondent submits that the Court should exercise its discretion to refuse relief because the breach did not affect the outcome of the Tribunal decision (see SZLWI v MIAC [2008] FCA 1330 at [45] ; SZJZN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 519 at [41] ; SZMAN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1351 at [31] - [38]; SZJHG v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2007] FMCA 2050 at [47] - [48]). The Tribunal took into account the applicant's conduct in Australia in the context of considering a possible sur place claim which was not articulated by the applicant, to the applicant's benefit. The Tribunal did not rely on the conduct in Australia to find against the applicant and would have come to the same conclusion if it had made a s 91R(3) finding and disregarded the conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 44">In support of Ground 6, it was submitted that "on the proper construction of s 91R(3) , a decision-maker may only disregard conduct engaged in by a person in Australia if the sole purpose for which the person engaged in the conduct in Australia was to strengthen the person's claim to be a refugee" (citing SZJZN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2008) 169 FCR 1 , [2008] FCA 519 at [32] and [35]). The Tribunal failed to appreciate this, and it "failed to consider that the applicant's conduct in Australia may have had multiple purposes" . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] RRTA 529">The Tribunal also understands that when determining whether conduct has been engaged in 'otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person's claim to be a refugee' the decision-maker may only disregard conduct engaged in for the dominant purpose of strengthening a refugee claim ( SZJZN v MIAC [2008] FCA 519 (Madgwick J, 18 April 2008) at [35]). Findings as to whether an applicant has engaged in activities for the purpose contemplated by s.91R(3) are findings of fact ( SZKHD v MIAC [2008] FCA 112 (Collier J, 19 February 2008) at [31]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 1606">Mr Godwin referred the Court to SZJHG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [23] at [47], SZMAN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [24] at [31]-[38], SZJZN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [25] at [40] and SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [26] at [45]-[46] in support of the proposition that the Court should exercise its discretion and refuse to grant relief in the circumstances. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 1491">Mr Godwin, counsel for the First Respondent referred the Court to SZJZN v the Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 519 ; (2008) 101 ALD 284 (" SZJZN ") where Madgwick J said at [35], obiter, that " the purpose " referred to in s.91R(3)(b) for which the Applicant entered into conduct in Australia meant " the dominant purpose ". Madgwick J stated at [32] as follows: " It cannot, in my opinion, be the position that, where an applicant ha multiple purposes for engaging in conduct in Australia, no matter how relevantly unimportant the s.91R(3) purpose may be, its existence will prevent the decision-maker from having regard to it. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] RRTA 396">That said, regarding s.91R(3) of the Act, the Tribunal understands that when determining whether conduct has been engaged in 'otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person's claim to be a refugee' the decision-maker may only disregard conduct engaged in for the dominant purpose of strengthening a refugee claim ( SZJZN v MIAC [2008] FCA 519 (Madgwick J, 18 April 2008) at [35]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 1351">Moreover in SZJZN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 519 ; [2008] FCA 519 ; (2008) 169 FCR 1 Madgwick J suggested (at [40]) that if, contrary to his view, " conduct " in s.91R(3) should be regarded as including ideas and beliefs motivating the conduct, the only " infraction " of s.91R(3) by the Tribunal " was in looking at such ideation with a view to considering whether it might assist the appellant in relation to his likely future conduct if returned to China, and coming to a negative conclusion ". It was however said to be plain that had no regard been had to such ideation, the application was in any case doomed to fail so that any error was immaterial. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] RRTA 190">Despite the provisions of s91R(3) of the Act, conduct which is taken partially with the intention of strengthening refugee claims may nevertheless be taken into consideration by the Tribunal SZJZN v MIAC [2008] FCA 519 .</sentence>
