<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 251">In Canpoint International Pty Ltd v Anar International Pvt Ltd [2008] FCA 4 , Stone J, in dealing with an offsetting claim in relation to loss of business, said (at [58] to [59]) as follows: 
 [58] ... Whilst the Court does not require evidence of a standard expected on a final claim in applications of this kind, contradictions in evidence can be fatal if they make the claim as a whole implausible; see Edge Technology [2000] NSWSC 471 ; 34 ACSR 301. ... It is accepted that the amount claimed by the plaintiff may have "elements of uncertainty"; Elm Financial Services [2004] NSWSC 560 at [19] . 

 
 [59] In Edge Technology [2000] NSWSC 471 ; 34 ACSR 301 , a bare assertion of an amount for loss of profits without further evidence as to how that amount was calculated was held to be insufficient to ground a genuine offsetting claim in that amount; see Edge Technology at 316. ... The Court thus has sufficient evidence to say that the claim is genuine, whilst not seeking to assess the merits of the claim.
