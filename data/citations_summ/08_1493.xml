<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1592">
 This was a copyright infringement and breach of confidence case in which I previously delivered reasons for decision finding in favour of the applicant, Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd ("Krueger"), on the issues of both liability and quantum: Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage &amp; Distribution Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 803 (liability judgment) and Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage &amp; Distribution Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1493 (quantum judgment). The reader's familiarity with those earlier reasons is assumed for present purposes.  Vawdrey submits that, notwithstanding the matters I referred to in the quantum judgment, its conduct in the defence of the infringement action was not such as to warrant departure from an ordinary party-party costs award. I reject this submission. In the quantum judgment, I cited four examples of conduct I considered supported an indemnity costs order: [2008] FCA 1493 at [63]. Vawdrey submits that the first example, the evidence of Paul and Michael Vawdrey that each was the creator of the sliding gates restraint system (which was inconsistent as between the two and with co-defendant Camerons' claim that they had created the system), was not unreasonable at the outset and did not result in Krueger being put to proof unreasonably. I cannot accept this submission. Vawdrey knew or should have known that the evidence was unreasonable at the outset. As I found in the liability judgment (at [20]), Paul Vawdrey's evidence that he came up with the idea was inconsistent with his own earlier statutory declaration that he could not remember who came up with the idea as well as his father's evidence (at [44]). While a party is of course entitled to put mutually inconsistent theories in the alternative, the proffer of such inherently implausible evidence here in light of other evidence within that party's own control and knowledge from the outset goes beyond ordinary litigation conduct. Moreover, I find that it did lengthen the conduct of the trial, both by adding to the cross-examination required of Messrs Vawdrey and by increasing the amount of evidence that Krueger had to put on to meet the point.  It is difficult to know where to begin in unpacking this submission. First, as I noted in the quantum judgment, Camerons should, as a prima facie matter, be liable for the whole of the costs related to breach of confidence because Vawdrey was not a party to that claim: [2008] FCA 1493 at [65] . It is unclear why Vawdrey would appear to submit, against its own interests and against what has already been acknowledged by the Court in its favour, that Camerons should be liable for less than all such costs. Probably what Vawdrey meant to say was that: 1. the Cameron entities should be liable for all of the costs of the breach of confidence claim (and thus three-sixths of the overall costs) and two-thirds of the copyright costs on the basis that there were two Camerons corporate respondents but only one for Vawdrey (and thus a further two-sixths of the overall costs); and 2. Vawdrey should be liable for the remaining one-third of the copyright costs (and thus one-sixth of the overall costs).  In the quantum judgment, I outlined my preliminary views as to the appropriate costs orders, which were that Vawdrey pay: (1) on an indemnity basis, one-third of Krueger's costs of and incidental to the proceedings up to and including the trial on liability; and (2) on a party-party basis, Krueger's costs of and incidental to the proceedings following the conclusion of the trial on liability, but excluding Krueger's costs of and incidental to the settlement with the first to third and fifth respondents (collectively, the Camerons parties): [2008] FCA 1493 at [63] - [65]. The question of the costs of the cross-claim was addressed in the liability judgment: see para 3 of the Orders made on 30 May 2008.  In the end, therefore, I am not dissuaded from my tentative view that, prima facie, Vawdrey should bear one-half of Krueger's costs in relation to the copyright claim because that was the only claim made against Vawdrey and because the Camerons entities, who acted and were represented together, must be considered collectively, not individually, as Vawdrey's co-respondent on the copyright claim. The reason I did not propose to make what seemed prima facie to be the appropriate costs order was because the issues and evidence involved in the breach of confidence and copyright claims were overlapping. For example, evidence that Camerons communicated the substance of the Krueger Drawings to Vawdrey in order to aid Vawdrey in the creation of its own drawings was relevant to establishing both a breach of Camerons' obligation of confidence to Krueger as well as a breach of Krueger's copyright in the Krueger Drawings. I thus considered that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the parties or a taxing officer to apportion costs on a per-claim basis: [2008] FCA 1493 at [65] .  Vawdrey next submits that, whatever the correct apportionment of the costs liability ought to be, those costs should be awarded against it only on the ordinary party-party basis rather than an indemnity basis. In the quantum judgment, I cited the reasons of Besanko J in Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2 ) [2008] FCA 746 at [17] (which in turn cited Goldberg J's decision in Flags 2000 Pty Ltd v Smith [2003] FCA 1067 ; (2003) 59 IPR 191) for the proposition that a respondent's conduct in its unsuccessful defence of an infringement action may warrant an award of costs against it on an indemnity basis: [2008] FCA 1493 at [58] , [63]. The cited cases, among others, stand as authority for the general proposition that a defendant's conduct in the defence of an action may support an award of indemnity costs where, among other things, the applicant is put to proof of its case unreasonably, the conduct causes undue delay or waste, or the conduct demonstrates wilful disregard of known facts of established law.  Moreover, although Krueger's claimed gross profit margin of 40% was rejected, it was not an arbitrary figure. Krueger produced two witnesses, Messrs Bridgman and Rankin, who gave evidence in support of that figure backed by detailed calculations and data. Indeed, the factual basis for Krueger's damages claim was not seriously disputed by Vawdrey; rather, the question ultimately came down to one of methodology, as I explained in the quantum judgment: [2008] FCA 1493 at [47] - [52]. As the experts themselves agreed, and as I explicitly found (at [48]), there was nothing inappropriate per se in either side's approach. In those circumstances, it cannot be said that Krueger's claimed amount was unreasonable.  In the quantum judgment, I did not make final orders, but instead directed the parties to submit a joint minute of proposed final orders as to the amount of damages and costs: [2008] FCA 1493 at [66] . The parties now agree, subject of course to any eventual appeal by the fourth respondent, Vawdrey Australia Pty Ltd ("Vawdrey"), that the appropriate order is that there be judgment for Krueger against Vawdrey in the sum of $438,904.60, including interest, to be paid within 28 days. The calculation of the sum of $438,904.60 was provided by the parties and was also the subject of agreement. The calculation is set out in Confidential Annexure A, as a component of the calculation is confidential. </sentence>
