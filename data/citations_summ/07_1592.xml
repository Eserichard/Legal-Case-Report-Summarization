<citphrase id="cp23.15" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">migration act 1958 (cth), ss 6 , 6a. in an application for review of a decision of the minister for immigration and ethnic affairs made in 1984 refusing an application for a permanent entry permit to an applicant who was the spouse of a permanent resident on the basis that the applicant's marriage had been assessed as being one where the parties did not genuinely intend to continue living as a married couple in australia, it being the minister's policy to refuse permanent entry permits in such cases.  held: (1) that relevant considerations which should have been taken into account were not, thus making the minister's decision invalid pursuant to s 5(2)(b) of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (the act), such considerations being:  (i) a report made in 1981 by an interviewing officer in suva expressing an opinion that the marriage relationship was genuine, such report being part of the history of the relationship, all of which was relevant in determining the quality of the marriage as at the date of the minister deciding the application. although the report was not presented to the minister, it was on the departmental file and was accordingly to be regarded as being constructively before him.  peko-wallsend ltd v. minister for aboriginal affairs (1985) 59 alr 51 , referred to.  (ii) statutory declarations of neighbours and acquaintances as to the applicant leading a normal married life and a letter of a social worker as to the applicant's wife living at home with the applicant, such documents being available to the minister, but there being nothing to indicate that he had taken any account of them.  (2) that in determining whether an administrative decision made under statutory authority falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp23.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 255">Third, and in any event, there is no general obligation or duty on the Tribunal to make enquiries in the statutory context under which the Tribunal is required to operate ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 121 at [21] to [22] per Gummow and Hayne JJ. See also SZJBA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 at [46] per Allsop J, WAGJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 277 at [24] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 285">In relation to the complaint that the Tribunal failed to make inquiries to the assistant parish priest who was the purported author of a letter received by the Tribunal, I am not satisfied that this omission evidences any jurisdictional error. The Tribunal is normally not bound to make further inquiries to establish the authenticity or truth of corroborative documents, and there is no circumstance in the present case which brings the situation within the extraordinary circumstances in which a duty to make further inquiries might arise. I have assumed that Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZIAI (2009) 259 ALR 429 , [2009] HCA 39 at [25] gives continuing life to the principles previously applied in cases such as Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [77] , and SZJBA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 at [59] - [60]. In the absence of any obligation to make such an inquiry, the failure of the Tribunal to make it would not cause a fair-minded lay observer in the present case to doubt whether the Tribunal might not be conducting its review with an open mind. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 90">In particular, I do not consider that the Tribunal was under any legal obligation to adjourn, so as to engage in further investigations as to the authenticity of the documents presented by the applicant, either by itself or by requesting the Secretary to conduct investigations pursuant to s.427(1)(d). It has been well-established in the Federal Court that the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion in relation to investigation is not vitiated by a failure to investigate, except in exceptional circumstances (cf. Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [77] , and SZJBA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 at [59] - [60]) . This line of authority may have survived the High Court's judgment in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 (see [25]). Assuming that it has, I can find nothing in the present circumstances satisfying the principles which have been articulated in the Federal Court. Importantly, the argument presented in particular (iii) of Ground 1 does not explain how inquiries " of the PRC authorities directly " could properly have been made by the Tribunal, nor how they would have clearly resolved the Tribunal's concerns about these documents. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 1300">It is the case, as Mr Pinder, in my view, again correctly submitted, that there is no general duty on the Tribunal to have made inquiries or to have investigated, nor to have made inquiries of his employer in the circumstances of this case ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 121 at [21] to [22] per Gummow and Hayne JJ.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 1198">As to the reference of failure to investigate, there is no general obligation on the Tribunal to make any further investigation that I can see in this case. The applicant does not say with any specificity what the Tribunal failed to investigate. If what he means is that it failed to make inquiries, then, as have said, I cannot see that there is any obligation on the Tribunal to have done so ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 121 at [21] to [22] per Gummow and Hayne JJ; see also SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 at [46] per Allsop J; WAGJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 277 at [24] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 1247">Secondly, the appellant submits that the Tribunal, pursuant to SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 , was obliged to undertake reasonably open and regular administrative steps to permit or facilitate fulfilment of the ' real and meaningful nature of the invitation to comment ' (at [53]). The appellant submits that such obligation arises where the Tribunal is aware that the record of claims made by an applicant and received by the Tribunal is incomplete. It is submitted by the appellant that the Tribunal was aware of a ' conspicuous absence of any explanation ' of the medical records submitted by the appellant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCA 1118">SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 was another case where the circumstances were rare or exceptional. In that case a coversheet together with a five page submission had apparently been forwarded by facsimile to the Refugee Review Tribunal in response to a s 424A letter under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) inviting comment on certain information, but only the cover sheet was received. Allsop J, as his Honour then was, held that it was a case where the Tribunal needed to see and should have inquired about the absence of the missing five page submission. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCAFC 123">25 As to ground 3, her Honour was satisfied that the appellant's counsel in the hearing before the Tribunal had been properly instructed and had had an opportunity to flag the need for further inquiries into the provenance of psychological and sentencing reports, but had not done so. Her Honour distinguished the present case from that in SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 , where the failure in the Tribunal's process was merely " to take a simple administrative step of an office or housekeeping nature ". Her Honour also placed importance on the fact that there was no challenge to the facts contained in those documents. Her Honour accordingly held that no duty to make further inquiries arose in these circumstances. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FMCA 750">The issue before the Court on appeal was whether the Tribunal should have made further enquiries of the two persons who had provided the certification, and/or the Association itself (at [16]). It is important to note that the way that the matter was argued before his Honour did not involve any submission that the power of the Tribunal to make further enquiries imposed upon it any duty or obligation to do so. This was done with reference to SGLB , SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCA 1592 , and WAGJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 277 (at [18]). The issue before his Honour, therefore, was "whether or not it was unreasonable not to have made further inquiries" (at [18]). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FMCA 582">While this ground is expressed in terms of procedural fairness, in submissions the applicant placed reliance on s.425 of the Migration Act which requires the Tribunal to invite the applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. It was contended that the requisite " meaningful opportunity " to appear to give evidence and present arguments under s.425 (see Allsop J in SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 at [53] and SZGYM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1923 at [27] per Graham J) had not been provided. In light of s.422B of the Act and the manner in which this ground was argued I have considered whether there was a failure to comply with s.425 of the Act.  Reference was made to the remarks of Goldberg J in Mazhar (at [31]), including the oft-cited comment that the invitation to a hearing " must not be a hollow shell or am empty gesture" (also see SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 at [53] per Allsop J). Particular reliance was placed on SZGYM in which Graham J stated at [27]: Whilst there is no provision in the Act dealing with the engagement of interpreters it is evident that a meaningful opportunity to give evidence and present arguments in the case of a person who is not fluent in the English language will only be afforded if an interpreter is present and it is evident that, subject to a reasonably accurate interpretation, that which the applicant wishes to convey to the Tribunal and that which the Tribunal wishes to convey to the applicant is fairly interpreted. </sentence>

In the present case, there was no special circumstance which would give rise to any such duty (compare: Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [77] , SZJBA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 at [59] - [60], SZIAI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 [Special leave granted 13-2-09], SZICU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 1 at [29] , and Wrecker v Secretary, DEST [2008] FCAFC 108 ; (2008) 168 FCR 272 at [110] ).

In that case Allsop J considered a circumstance in which the Tribunal relied upon the fact that an appellant failed to submit a response to the invitation to make submissions when in fact the Tribunal had received a cover sheet stating that submissions were enclosed even though, apparently by mistake, they were not.

39 It seems to me that the circumstances of this case were not such as to require the Tribunal to make some further inquiry about the documents submitted by the appellant before making a decision on the application for review. The circumstances in which such inquiry is required are limited to rare or exceptional cases such as were considered by Kenny J in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 242 ALR 455 and by Allsop J, as his Honour then was, in SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2008] FCA 1803">31 It is useful to also note a judgment of Allsop J, as his Honour then was, in SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 , to which reference was helpfully made by counsel for the appellant. In that case, a cover sheet together with a five page submission had apparently been forwarded by facsimile to the Tribunal in response to a s 424A letter inviting comment on certain information, but only the cover sheet was received. Plainly, it was a case where the Tribunal needed to see, and should have inquired about the absence of, the missing five page submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2008] FMCA 1201">In any event, the Tribunal did not proceed without making enquiries; it made repeated enquiries of the applicant and his lawyers, and it gave an opportunity to respond until the decision was handed down. The practical difficulties of obtaining confidential information from 
Dr Crimmins are to be contrasted with the situation in Lee (supra) where the Tribunal could simply have obtained information that was in the possession of the department. The present case is also distinguishable from SZJBA v MIC [2007] FCA 1592 where pages were missing from a document sent by facsimile.  In SZJBA v MIC [2007] FCA 1592 Justice Allsop held that in relation to s.425A letters each invitation must be real and meaningful. SZJBA is a very different case from the present. There a page was missing from a facsimile sent to the Tribunal. The applicant was not in a position to know of the defect. Here the applicant was fully aware of the shortfall in his material --- he was best placed to provide further material --- but declined.

<sentence id="cs28" from="[2008] FMCA 1268">I note the clear qualification placed on these general principles in the remarks of Kenny J in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 (2007) 242 ALR 455 , in particular at [63] that: A failure by a decision maker to obtain important information on a critical issue, which the decision-maker knows or ought reasonably to know is readily available, may be characterized as so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would proceed to make the decision without making the inquiry: see Prasad at FCR 169-70; ALR 562-4 per Wilcox J ... 
And at [77]:
 
 this is one of those rare or exceptional cases where a decision-maker acting reasonably would have made some further inquiry before making a decision. 
 It is in this context that I note the remarks of Wilcox J in Prasad as quoted by Kenny J, with emphasis, in Le at [64] that: Equally, [a power] is exercised in an improper manner if the decision-maker makes his decision --- which perhaps in itself, reasonably reflects the material before him --- in a manner so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable person could have taken this course, for example by unreasonably failing to ascertain relevant facts which he knew to be readily available to him. I also note the endorsement of the remarks of Kenny J in SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 by Allsop J at [60]: The same conclusion is to be reached by the application of the principles that in certain circumstances the decision of a Tribunal or decision-maker will be vitiated if some inquiry is not made. Most recently, Kenny J examined these cases in her Honour's comprehensive judgment in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318. It can readily accepted, as her Honour said, that there is no general obligation to inquire found in s 424(7), nor is there a general obligation to initiate inquiries or to make an applicant's case for him or her.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2008] FCA 1372">In this circumstance what vitiates the decision is the manner in which it was made. Since this is a limited proposition, it does not conflict with the larger statement that the Tribunal is under no general duty with respect to making enquiries... 
Appl'd: Bunnag v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 357 at [36] per McKerracher J. In circumstances where a migration agent forwards by way of facsimile a cover sheet together with a five page submission and where only the cover sheet is received, it has been held to be unreasonable for the Tribunal not to inquire about the missing pages: SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 , 164 FCR 14 per Allsop J. 18 There was, however, no opposition to advancing the submission as to a failure to make inquiries in terms of the decision being unreasonable. So structured, the dispute centred upon whether or not it was unreasonable not to have made further inquiries. No submission was advanced on behalf of the Appellant, nor could it have been advanced, that the power of the Tribunal to make further inquiries imposed upon it " any duty or obligation to do so ": Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 at [43] , 207 ALR 12 at 21---2 per Gummow and Hayne JJ. See also: SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 at [46] , [2007] FCA 1592 ; 164 FCR 14 at 25 per Allsop J; WAGJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 277 at [24] . Nor was any submission advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister that there was not a line of inquiry which was readily available to the Tribunal and centrally relevant to the task being undertaken: eg, Li v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1098 at [28] , [2007] FCA 1098 ; 96 ALD 361 at 367 per Kenny J. The simple submission advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister was that there was material upon which the Tribunal could justifiably have based its decision and there was, in those circumstances, no duty to inquire further. The response of the Association was disclosed to the now Appellant and he provided his response.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs31" from="[2008] FCAFC 108">109 Although the Tribunal is invested with these powers, the Tribunal is under no statutory duty to exercise a power of inquiry or compulsion. In that sense, the Tribunal is in an analogous position to the Refugee Review Tribunal in relation to that Tribunal's permissive powers ( MIMIA v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [43] per Callinan J at [124]; SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor 96 ALD 270 ; [2007] FCA 1592 per Allsop J [46] to [49]). The circumstances under which a decision will be invalid for failure to inquire are strictly limited. In Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-170, Wilcox J put the limitation in these terms:
 It is no part of the duty of the decision-maker to make the applicant's case for him. It is not enough that the court finds that the sounder course would have been to make inquiries. But in a case where it is obvious that material is readily available which is centrally relevant to the decision to be made, it seems to me that to proceed to a decision without making any attempt to obtain that information may properly be described as an exercise of decision-making power in a manner so unreasonable that no unreasonable person would have so exercised it. It would follow that the court, on judicial review, should receive evidence as to the existence and nature of that information. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs32" from="[2008] FCA 789">15 Insofar as the second contention is concerned, it may be accepted that the Tribunal carries out an " inquisitorial process ": SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 at [53] , [2007] FCA 1592 ; 164 FCR 14 at 27---8. Allsop J there observed:
 [53] ... the obligation of the Tribunal to give a real and meaningful invitation to comment carried with it the obligation to take reasonably open and regular administrative procedural steps to permit or facilitate fulfilment of the real and meaningful nature of the invitation, where not to take such steps would undermine or subvert the meaningfulness or the reality of the invitation. That obligation involves such mundane things as opening letters, reading them once opened and taking at least basic simple steps that would be taken in any well-run commercial, professional or governmental office, conformable with the recognition of the importance of the response to the invitation to the rights of the applicant and the review process contained within Pt 7 of the Migration Act . This does not rest on some posited duty of inquiry. It is not engaging in steps that require for their enforcement some express statutory power. ... ... [57] These conclusions can be fortified by the recognition, so often stated, that the Tribunal is engaged in an inquisitorial process... [58] This inquisitorial function has become relevant in a number of contexts. In Applicant S [2004] HCA 25 ; 217 CLR 387 at [76] McHugh J said: If the Tribunal had considered the issue that it was legally required to consider, it was open to the Tribunal to investigate whether such a perception existed, whether within the Afghan society or some section of it, or objectively. Indeed, arguably in the context of its inquisitorial process, the Tribunal had a duty to seek evidence concerning this vital matter. See also: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S 154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 at [58] , [2003] HCA 60 ; 201 ALR 437 at 450---1; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 at [73] , 207 ALR 12 at 30---3.  The legislative requirement is that an invitation must be extended to an applicant " to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review ": Migration Act , s 425(1). This right is " clearly an important and central right " in the review system established by Part 7 of the Migration Act : Liu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1362 at [44] , [2001] FCA 1362 ; 113 FCR 541 at 552; Amankwah v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1162 at [13] [1999] FCA 1162 ; , 91 FCR 248 at 251.

<sentence id="cs34" from="[2008] FCA 774">33 Notwithstanding those matters and the emphasis given to them by the appellant, the question for determination before this Court is whether there is error on the part of the Federal Magistrate. The ground is really put forward on the footing that the Federal Magistrate erred by failing to find error on the part of the Tribunal by reason of jurisdictional error because the Tribunal failed to make external inquiries of either the Australian High Commission or other authorities such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or United Nations agencies as to the content and accuracy of the documents. I am not satisfied that there is any such jurisdictional error on this ground. In other words, the Tribunal, consistent with authority, is not required to make external forensic third party inquiry in relation to the documents ( Prasad v MIEA [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169 per Wilcox J; MIMIA v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 ; [2004] HCA 32 per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [43] per Callinan J at [124]; Appellant S395/2002 v MIMA [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 78 ALD 8 ; 203 ALR 112 ; SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor 96 ALD 270 ; [2007] FCA 1592 per Allsop J [46] to [49]).</sentence>

In making this argument, the appellant relies on the principles set out in SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14. However, that case is inapposite here for the reasons set out below. 62 In SZJBA [2007] FCA 1592 ; 164 FCR 14 , Allsop J said, starting at [53]:
 
 On either basis, the obligation of the Tribunal to give a real and meaningful invitation to comment carried with it the obligation to take reasonably open and regular administrative procedural steps to permit or facilitate fulfilment of the real and meaningful nature of the invitation, where not to take such steps would undermine or subvert the meaningfulness or the reality of the invitation. That obligation involves such mundane things as opening letters, reading them once opened and taking at least basic simple steps that would be taken in any well-run commercial, professional or governmental office, conformable with the recognition of the importance of the response to the invitation to the rights of the applicant and the review process contained within Pt 7 of the Migration Act .

In our opinion, that case is distinguishable from the present case because in that case there was a failure to inquire into readily available and centrally relevant information, which is not the situation in the present case. Having regard to the procedural history in the present case, there was no apparent reason for the Tribunal to consider that further inquiries as to why the appellant did not appear would have been of any assistance to it in reaching a conclusion. The obligation imposed on the Tribunal by ss 425 and 425A of the Act is satisfied if the appellant is notified as to the time and place of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs38" from="[2008] FMCA 4">The letters were submitted to the Tribunal after it had given the applicant's adviser (who indicated that he had come into the matter late and had not a chance to obtain firm instructions) the requested opportunity to put on further submissions and file documents in support of the application. It could not be said that the Tribunal's invitation to do so was not " real and meaningful " (see SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 at [50] --- [60]. The Tribunal considered the letters and their content. The fact that because the Tribunal considered the applicant completely lacked credibility, it did not accept that the contents of the letters were true does not establish a failure to meet its s.425(1) obligation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs39" from="[2007] FCA 2036">21 The authorities of the Court have made it clear that as a general rule there is no duty on the Tribunal to carry out its own inquiries.
