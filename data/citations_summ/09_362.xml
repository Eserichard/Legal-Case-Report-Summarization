<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] RRTA 49">The applicant's 1996 application was refused by a delegate of the Minister [in] July 1997 and she applied to this Tribunal for review of that decision. The Tribunal (differently constituted) affirmed the decision under review [in] July 1999. In a letter to the Minister dated [in] April 2009 seeking his intervention under section 48B of the Act the applicant's current representative said that the applicant had subsequently joined the Muin and Lie class action and that she had made several telephone calls to her original representative regarding the progress of that action. Her current representative said that in 2003 the applicant had found that her original representative's office had closed and she was unable to contact him. She said that the applicant had been placed in immigration detention [in] March 2007. After the applicant was detained she unsuccessfully sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision on her 1996 application: see SZKKC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1133 ; SZKKC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 362. [In] March 2010 the Department wrote to the applicant indicating that the Minister had exercised his discretion under section 48B of the Act to permit her to make a further application for a protection visa.
