<citphrase id="cp14.15" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">migration act 1958 (cth), ss 6 , 6a. in an application for review of a decision of the minister for immigration and ethnic affairs made in 1984 refusing an application for a permanent entry permit to an applicant who was the spouse of a permanent resident on the basis that the applicant's marriage had been assessed as being one where the parties did not genuinely intend to continue living as a married couple in australia, it being the minister's policy to refuse permanent entry permits in such cases.  held: (1) that relevant considerations which should have been taken into account were not, thus making the minister's decision invalid pursuant to s 5(2)(b) of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (the act), such considerations being:  (i) a report made in 1981 by an interviewing officer in suva expressing an opinion that the marriage relationship was genuine, such report being part of the history of the relationship, all of which was relevant in determining the quality of the marriage as at the date of the minister deciding the application. although the report was not presented to the minister, it was on the departmental file and was accordingly to be regarded as being constructively before him.  peko-wallsend ltd v. minister for aboriginal affairs (1985) 59 alr 51 , referred to.  (ii) statutory declarations of neighbours and acquaintances as to the applicant leading a normal married life and a letter of a social worker as to the applicant's wife living at home with the applicant, such documents being available to the minister, but there being nothing to indicate that he had taken any account of them.  (2) that in determining whether an administrative decision made under statutory authority falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp14.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 907">" The review process ", it may be accepted, " is inquisitorial rather than adversarial ": NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 at [58] , [2004] FCAFC 263 ; 144 FCR 1 at 18 per Black CJ, French and Selway JJ. And s 427(1)(d) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) confers a discretionary power upon the Tribunal to " require the Secretary to arrange for the making of any investigation ...". But that section does not impose any general duty to inquire: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Cassim [2000] HCA 50 at [12] to [14] [2000] HCA 50 ; , 175 ALR 209 at 212 to 213.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 198">The short answer to the applicant's submission based upon SZBEL is that s 425 does not require the RRT to identify the significance of the questions that it puts to a claimant or the ultimate matter or issue to which those questions go. That is not what is required by SZBEL , and is an attempt to import the requirements of s 424A(1) into s 425. " Considering the question of a Tribunal's obligation to advise on the sufficiency of evidence Flick J stated the following in S1925 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 246 at [24]: Nor can the Appellant avoid these consequences by, for example, contending that the failure to invite further clarification was a denial of procedural fairness. It was for the Appellant to advance such information as he considered relevant to his application. An invitation seeking further information was forwarded and a response provided by the Appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1398">12 In relation to the 'failure to investigate claim', his Honour held that the Tribunal was not under any obligation to investigate the appellant's claims: citing Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 , Re Ruddock: Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437 and S1925 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 246. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 901">The second ground in the amended application, which is numbered 3, alleges that the Tribunal failed to investigate the applicant's claim. Although the Tribunal is empowered to make inquiries, it is under no obligation to undertake them. This was made clear by the High Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21 [43]. Similarly, in Re Ruddock; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437: The tribunal conducting an inquisitorial hearing is not obliged to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which the applicant chooses not to embark on. (per Gummow and Hayne JJ at 451 [58], Gleeson CJ agreeing at 438 [1]) 
Such matters were also considered and explained by Flick J in S1925 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 246 at [17] --- [23]. </sentence>
