<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 298">In relation to item (2) above - the fact that the claim expressed in the statutory demand as a debt for "Breach of Agreement" was in truth an unliquidated claim - the plaintiff relies on reasoning found in the decision of Finn J in Hardel Property Holdings Pty Ltd v Allmark Property Management Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 22 ; (2008) 26 ACLC 122 and, in particular, the following statement of his Honour at [25]: 
 
"A use of the statutory demand procedures in respect of a debt known to be spurious would give rise to an abuse of process if the statutory demand in turn was used to found a winding up application, the more so if, as alleged here, there is some evidence suggesting the likelihood that the statutory demand procedure itself is being used for some tactical purpose relating to proceedings in another court. " 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 509">The emphatic language of s 459G(3) admits of no other conclusion: see Pinn v Barroleg Pty Ltd (1997) 138 FLR 417 ; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Tixana Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 968 ; (2003) 202 ALR 401 ; Hardel Property Holdings Pty Ltd v Allmark Property Management Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 22 ; (2008) 26 ACLC 122 at [1] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1148">11 It is now well settled that, if a s 459G application and affidavit are not filed and served within the time so specified, the Court has no power to extend the period for the making of such an application: see Aussie Vic Plant Hire at [3]; David Grant &amp; Co Pty Limited (rec apptd) v Westpac Banking Corporation [1995] HCA 43 ; (1995) 184 CLR 265. In the present matter, the statutory demand was served on Dromana on 29 November 2007. The application to set it aside was filed in the Supreme Court of Victoria on 20 December 2007. It was not served on Mr Gryst until 21 December 2007. In consequence, that application was not one made "in accordance with section 459G" of the Act. The emphatic language of s 459G(3) admits of no other conclusion: see Pinn v Barroleg Pty Ltd (1997) 138 FLR 417 ; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Tixana Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 968 ; (2003) 202 ALR 401 ; Hardel Property Holdings Pty Ltd v Allmark Property Management Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 22 ; (2008) 26 ACLC 122 at [1] . While counsel for the plaintiff has sought to avoid this conclusion by recourse to "purposive legislation", the Parliament, in my view, has spoken on this matter with unmistakeable clarity.</sentence>
