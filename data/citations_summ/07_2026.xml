<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] HCA 21">In his reasons for judgment delivered on 19 December 2007 in a related Federal Court proceeding, Emmett J recorded that the ACC accepted that the ACC Act does not abrogate the right or duty of a recipient of a s 29 notice to claim legal professional privilege on behalf of a person (whether the recipient of the notice or a third party) who holds the privilege [2] . The litigation which has reached this Court has been conducted on that footing. It also appears to have been accepted that the powers of the ACC would not extend to the use or dissemination of documents to the content of which the privilege attached, and that such use or dissemination might be restrained by injunction.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] HCATrans 4">If I could simply give the reference - it was in the decision of MM v Australian Crime Commission [2007] FCA 2026 ; (2007) 244 ALR 452 at [30] . MR GLEESON: [2007] FCA 2026 ; (2007) 244 ALR 452 at paragraph [30] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1971">40 On the other hand, the advantage that the investigative team have gained from access to the Disputed Documents is ephemeral in the extreme. Of course, if there had been any impropriety in connection with the Commission's gaining access to the Disputed Documents, the ephemeral nature of the advantage may be irrelevant. The principle of legal professional privilege is very important and should not be abrogated, except by clear statutory intervention. Further, it is clear that the Commission Act does not abrogate legal professional privilege, notwithstanding that the exercise of powers under the Commission Act may, in some circumstances, make it difficult for the privilege to be asserted (see MM v Australian Crime Commission [2007] FCA 2026).  46 Focus then shifted to the Related Proceeding. Directions hearings in relation to the Related Proceeding were conducted on a number of occasions during 2006 and 2007, with a final hearing on 28 November 2007. On 19 December 2007, I ordered that the Related Proceeding be dismissed with costs (see MM v Australian Crime Commission [2007] FCA 2026). An appeal was instituted by notice of appeal filed by Mr Hogan on 25 January 2008. That appeal was discontinued on 2 May 2008.  32 I concluded in the Related Proceeding that no officer of the Commission engaged in unlawful conduct in connection with the obtaining of any of the Disputed Documents from third parties: see MM v Australian Crime Commission [2007] FCA 2026. Further, Mr Hogan does not suggest that the Commission has engaged in any unlawful or improper conduct in relation to the Disputed Documents. While the Commission has exercised exorbitant powers conferred by the Commission Act, which override the rights of private individuals to privacy in relation to their own affairs, the Commission has not exceeded its powers. The consequence of the lawful exercise of those powers has been that documents that may be the subject of legal professional privilege have been given to the Commissioner and have been seen by officers of the Commission. The question is whether that, of itself, is sufficient to justify the Court's intervention in the performance by the Commission of its investigative duties and powers in the manner now sought by Mr Hogan. </sentence>

35 Secondly, a government agency or authority (such as ASIC) in the exercise of its compulsory powers must provide the person the subject of the exercise of the power with a reasonable opportunity to claim legal professional privilege on his or her own behalf: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Ltd (1989) 20 FCR 403 , 414 and MM v Australian Crime Commission [2007] FCA 2026 ; (2007) 244 ALR 452 at [35] - [36] ; but see JMA Accounting Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2004) 139 FCR 537 at [10]- [13]. Given the arrangements put in place by ASIC (see [9], [11] above), there was no (and could be no) complaint that the examinees were not provided with a reasonable opportunity to claim legal professional privilege on their own behalf. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1806">72 The ACC relied upon a series of decisions of this, and other Courts, in the main dealing with the use of inquisitorial or coercive powers to submit that natural justice or procedural fairness does not apply to the exercise of what they submitted, is a similar power under s 29 of the ACC Act, including: May v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 287 ; (1999) 92 FCR 152 (a notice under section 261 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth)); MM &amp; Anor v ACC [2007] FCA 2026 (a decision made by an examiner under section 29 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) in relation to a taxation avoidance investigation); Structureco Inc v Registrar of Trademarks [2003] FCA 1290 ; [2003] 132 FCR 558 (involving section 202 of the Trademarks Act 1995 (Cth)); Woodroffe v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2000) 179 ALR 750 (a notice given under s 218 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth)); Johns v ASC [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408 at 430 --- 431 (exercise of a power under section 127(4)(b) of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (Cth)); Riverside Nursing Care Pty ltd v Bishop [2000] FCA 1147 ; (2000) 100 FCR 519 (a duty imposed under section 67 of the Aged Care Act 1997 (Cth)).</sentence>
