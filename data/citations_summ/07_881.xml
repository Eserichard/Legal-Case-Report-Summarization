<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 136">15 The originating application was amended by leave granted by Gilmour J on 6 June 2007. On 7 June 2007 an ex parte interim injunction was granted against ONGC restraining it from taking further steps to demand or obtain payment or renewing such claims or demands, from the banks under the performance guarantees: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 881. Orders were also made on 7 June 2007 for leave to serve ONGC out of the jurisdiction. The injunction against the banks was extended on 12 June 2007 and on 19 June 2007, following an inter partes hearing, when an application by the banks to discharge the injunction was dismissed: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 927. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 2082">To maintain service ex juris , Clough needs to demonstrate a prima facie case for the relief claimed: FCR O 8, r 3(2)(c).

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1319">

68 In Clough Engineering Limited v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 881 , Gilmour J was concerned with an application for leave pursuant to O 8 of the Federal Court Rules to serve an application out of the jurisdiction and for orders to restrain Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd ("ONGC") from taking further steps to demand or obtain payment or renewing or claiming to renew such demand in respect of certain performance guarantees granted by the three respondent banks to ONGC. The applicant, Clough Engineering Limited, sought a declaration that ONGC by demanding and threatening to make a demand on the performance guarantees granted by the banks had engaged in, or proposed to engage in, unconscionable conduct in contravention of s 51AA of the TPA. Gilmour J granted leave to serve and he made an order restraining ONGC from taking any further step to demand or obtain payment or renewing or claiming to renew a demand for payment from the banks under the performance guarantees. Gilmour J said that there was authority which clearly supported the proposition that an inappropriate threat to call or a call on performance guarantees can be unconscionable conduct within s 51AA of the TPA and he referred to the decision in Samton . His Honour considered that it was appropriate to grant an injunction restraining ONGC from making a call on the performance guarantees and he appears to have relied on the fact that there was a serious question to be tried as to whether ONGC's conduct was unconscionable within s 51AA of the TPA. He also relied on another exception to the autonomy principle, namely, breach of a negative stipulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 927">6 The affidavit of Mr Malcolm Rutter sworn 15 June 2007 provides a very detailed account of the background to the Construction Contract and what has occurred since its execution. I have set out the relevant factual background as exposed in that affidavit in my reasons of 7 June 2007 when I, amongst other things, restrained ONGC from taking any further step to demand or to obtain payment or renewing or claiming to renew a demand for payment from any of the respondent Banks under the respective performance guarantees: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 881 [8]-[23]. It is accordingly not necessary for me to repeat that background detail here. Mr Rutter has variously deposed in his affidavit to the effect that Clough is not in any way in default under the Construction Contract. The Banks do not, understandably, attempt to contradict this. ONGC has not appeared in this application. </sentence>
