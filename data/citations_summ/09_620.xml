<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 155">In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Bargwanna [2009] FCA 620 ; (2009) 72 ATR 963 (at [28]), Edmonds J held that having regard to the scope, object and purpose of the 1997 ITA Act and the 1936 ITA Act as a whole, such provisions are not to be read widely. Strict adherence to the statutory requirements is necessary before the status is conferred. Although that decision is on appeal, it may readily be accepted that a loose interpretation permitting exemption would not be appropriate. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 126"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 508">I respectfully agree with the view expressed by Edmonds J in Commissioner of Taxation v Bargwanna [2009] FCA 620 at [28] that income tax exemption status requires strict adherence to the statutory requirements before that status is conferred. The statutory conditions that the applicant must meet before being entitled to exemption from income tax are set out in s 50-1 and s 50-40 of the ITAA 1997 as follows: 
 
 50-1 Entities whose ordinary income and statutory income is exempt 
 The total ordinary income and statutory income of the entities covered by the following tables is exempt from income tax. In some cases, the exemption is subject to special conditions. 
 

 
 
 50-40 Primary and secondary resources, and tourism 
 

 Primary and secondary resources, and tourism Item Exempt entity Special conditions 8.2 a society or association established for the purpose of promoting the development of any of the following Australian resources: (a) agricultural resources; (b) horticultural resources; (c) industrial resources; (d) manufacturing resources; (e) pastoral resources; (f) viticultural resources; (g) aquacultural resources; (h) fishing resources not carried on for the profit or gain of its individual members 
 Society or association

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 668">Recently, in Commissioner of Taxation v Bargwanna [2009] FCA 620 (12 June, 2009), in the course of considering whether a fund was applied for the purposes for which it was established within s 50-60 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), I said (at [28]): 
 It can be accepted that where Parliament has enacted legislation to encourage a particular activity, for example, legislation which gives particular concessions to the mining or petroleum industries, the legislation must be construed so as to promote Parliament's purpose and not so as to detract from that purpose: Totalizator Agency Board v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 69 FCR 311 at 323A per Hill J, with whom Tamberlin J and Sundberg J agreed. Thus an exemption which exists for the purpose of encouraging, rewarding or protecting some class of activity is to be given a liberal rather than a narrow construction and application: see Commissioner of Taxation v Reynolds Australia Alumina Ltd (1987) 18 FCR 29 at 35 per Beaumont J and at 46 --- 47 per Burchett J; Diethelm Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 44 FCR 450 at 457 per French J. But in the case of a provision which confers an exemption upon a particular kind of body or fund which meets certain requirements, Parliament's purpose is not promoted by construing the provision in a manner favourable to the body or fund referred to in it: see TAB at 323C per Hill J. Indeed, there is much to be said for the view that the privileged status of exemption from income tax on the income of a fund which aspires to that status demands strict adherence to the requirements that must be met before that status is conferred ...
