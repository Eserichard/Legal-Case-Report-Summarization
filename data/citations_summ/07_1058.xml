<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 992">I appreciate that a solicitor represented the applicant at the Tribunal. This in itself does not absolve the Tribunal from carrying out the mandate set forth in s 39 of the AAT Act: see, eg, Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1981] FCA 66 ; (1981) 54 FLR 334 , 342-43 per Bowen CJ and Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 , at 326 per Smithers J, and at 342 per Deane J. For instance, a failure of a tribunal to adjourn a matter could constitute a failure to allow a party to present his or her case even if an adjournment was not requested: see Deane J at 342 and Priddle v Fisher &amp; Sons (1968) 1 WLR 1478. On the other hand, I accept that in circumstances where a party is represented there is some onus upon a party to be proactive: see, eg, Schiffer v Pattison [2001] FCA 1094 and Farley-Smith [2007] FCA 1058 ; 45 AAR 474 at [54] . However, the solicitor representing the applicant in the circumstances of this case could hardly have been expected to know of the extent of the inadequacy of the translator when the applicant herself was not present to advise him. In an important respect, namely the inadequacy of the translation itself, the solicitor had no basis upon which to be proactive.  Section 39 of the AAT Act requires that the Tribunal apply notions of procedural fairness: see Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 per Mason J; O'Sullivan v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCA 387 ; (2003) 128 FCR 590 at [45] ; and Repatriation Commission v Farley-Smith [2007] FCA 1058 ; (2007) 45 AAR 474 at [54] . Obviously, the requirements of procedural fairness will depend upon the particular circumstances of each case. More specifically, s 39 provides that the Tribunal must ensure that every party before it is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case. If such a statutory duty is not complied with there is an error of law. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 965">It has been recognised that the AAT is obliged to apply notions of procedural fairness: Repatriation Commission v Farley-Smith [2007] FCA 1058 ; (2007) 96 ALD 348 and Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550. However, what will be procedural fairness will depend upon the particular circumstances of each case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 285">25 Section 40(1D) of the AAT Act provides that the Tribunal may give a party leave to inspect a document produced under summons. The relevant procedure is generally within the discretion of the Tribunal (s 33(1)(a) of the AAT Act). The Tribunal is required to give proper consideration to matters before it (s 33(1)(b)) and to ensure that every party to a proceeding is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case (s 39(1)). A "reasonable opportunity to present his or her case" requires the Tribunal to apply notions of procedural fairness ( Repatriation Commission v Farley-Smith [2007] FCA 1058 ; (2007) 96 ALD 348 at [54] per Middleton J; Australian Postal Corporation v Hayes [1989] FCA 176 ; (1989) 23 FCR 320 at 326 per Wilcox J).
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 139">Paragraph 119(1)(h) states that in making any decision in relation to a claim the Repatriation Commission (and hence this Tribunal)... shall take into account any difficulties that, for any reason, lie in the way of ascertaining the existence of any fact, matter, course or circumstance, including any reason attributable to: 
 "(i) the effects of the passage of time, including the effect of the passage of time on the availability of witnesses; and 
 
 (ii) the absence of, or a deficiency in, relevant official records, including an absence or deficiency resulting from the fact that an occurrence that happened during the service of a veteran, or of a member of the Defence Force or of a Peacekeeping Force, as defined by subsection 68(1) , was not reported to the appropriate authorities. " 
 
 
As was pointed out in Repatriation Commission v Farley-Smith [2007] FCA 1058 no reliance can be placed upon s 119 to fill in gaps where there is no evidence to support the veteran's case. </sentence>
