<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 899">It will be seen that substituted service of the Bankruptcy Notice required posting to both 11 and 13 --- 15 Deloraine Road, Edwardstown whereas substituted service of the creditor's petition required posting only to the 11 Deloraine Road address. The affidavit evidence before the Registrar on the application for substituted service of the creditor's petition contained an error. The process server deponent believed that the property at which he was attempting service, namely, the premises of AAA Demolition and Cartage, was 11 Deloraine Road when, in truth, it was 13 --- 15 Deloraine Road. The Registrar was unaware at the time that she made the sequestration order on 2 February 2009 that the creditors' petition had been posted to an address that was not the applicant's address. Had the Registrar known this, the Registrar would be bound to adjourn the creditors' petition so that appropriate arrangements could be made for personal service or for substituted service of the documents to the correct address.

 ORDERS 
 
(1) The bankruptcy of Mohamed Alaeddin be annulled pursuant to s.153B Bankruptcy Act 1966 . 6. Mr Alaeddin asserts that if the logs were taken into account and the premiums properly adjusted, including adjustments to late payment fees if the premiums quoted were not in fact due, the balance owing by him to CGU may well be under $2,000.00. He argues that in those circumstances the petition should have been dismissed. In the alternative, he submits, there was clearly some doubt about exactly how much was owed as at the date the petition was heard because of the various statements with different figures in them that I have previously referred to. In Hawthorne v Carter (Trustee), in the matter of Hawthorne (Bankrupt) [2006] FCA 1097 the creditors had not fully disclosed to the court at the time of the hearing of the petition that certain funds had been paid although the payment by the debtors had been returned. His Honour said at [8]: 
 
 
 " I think that had the Federal Magistrates Court known of these circumstances, it would have caused further inquiries to be made and would have adjourned the application for the sequestration orders, rather than making them as it did on 29 May 2006. In my view, the circumstances fall within those contemplated by Gibbs J in Re Williams (1968) 13 FLC 10 at 23. I also refer to the observations of Gummow J in Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347 at 350" </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 512">Clearly the issue of solvency is relevant in relation to the exercise of the discretion (see Pollock ), in the sense that a debtor's insolvency is a factor that would weigh heavily against exercising the discretion (see Layton v Westpac Banking Corp [2000] FCA 1752 ; (2000) 181 ALR 603 and Hawthorne v Carter [2006] FCA 1097).</sentence>
