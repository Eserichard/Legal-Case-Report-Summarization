<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 526">In late 2006, the applicant became aware that certain models of electric flame effect heaters were being sold by various retailers and suppliers which the applicant believed infringed the Patent. As a result, the applicant instituted five separate proceedings against the suppliers and retailers of the allegedly infringing electric flame effect heaters. I heard four of those five sets of proceedings together and delivered judgment in those proceedings on 26 November 2009 ( Bitech Engineering v Garth Living Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1393 ; (2009) 84 IPR 78). The proceedings which were determined by that judgment were: 
 
 
 (1) Bitech Engineering v Garth Living Pty Ltd (ACN 111 145 432) and Cohen Nominees Pty Limited (ACN 008 526 994); Garth Living Pty Ltd (ACN 111 145 432) v Bitech Engineering --- NSD 1681 of 2006; 
 (2) Bitech Engineering v Bunnings Group Limited (ACN 008 672 179) --- NSD 43 of 2007; 
 (3) Bitech Engineering v Flameglow Pty Ltd (ACN 117 672 518); Flameglow Pty Ltd (ACN 117 672 518) v Bitech Engineering --- NSD 105 of 2007; and 
 (4) Bitech Engineering v Hotpoint (Aust) Pty Ltd (ACN 082 599 086); Hotpoint (Aust) Pty Ltd (ACN 082 599 086) v Bitech Engineering --- NSD 2056 of 2007 
 
 
 The applicant was unsuccessful before me as far as its claims for infringement of the Patent were concerned. However, on appeal, the Full Court concluded that the Patent had been infringed and upheld the appeal ( Bitech Engineering v Garth Living Pty Ltd [2010] FCAFC 75 ; (2010) 86 IPR 468). Subsequently, disputes arose between the applicant, on the one hand, and the respondents, on the other hand, as to the extent to which the respondents were obliged to provide discovery. It became apparent that, at the heart of the parties' disagreement about discovery was a difference of opinion as to whether, in addition to the specific models of heaters which were found by the Full Court to have infringed the Patent, the applicant was entitled to pursue the respondents in respect of other models of heaters which had not to date been considered either by me at trial or by the Full Court on appeal. I considered that there was a question of principle which underlay the parties' dispute concerning discovery. I took the view that the best way of resolving that question of principle was to order in each of the extant proceedings that a separate question be heard separately from and before any further trial of any of those proceedings. Accordingly, on 17 March 2011, I made an order in the following terms in each of proceedings NSD 1681 of 2006, NSD 43 of 2007 and NSD 2056 of 2007: Pursuant to O 29 r 2(a) of the Federal Court Rules , the following question be heard separately from and before any further trial in the proceedings, namely: 
 
 
 
 Whether, upon the basis of the pleadings as they currently stand and in light of the judgments of this Court in Bitech Engineering v Garth Living Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1393 , Bitech Engineering v Garth Living Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 1460 , Bitech Engineering v Garth Living Pty Ltd [2010] FCAFC 75 and Bitech Engineering v Garth Living Pty Ltd (No 2) [2010] FCAFC 93 , it is open to the applicant to claim damages for infringement of its patent being Australian Patent No 621713 in respect of the importation, distribution or sale of electric flame heaters bearing model numbers [there was here inserted the relevant model numbers].

In Bitech , the patent in dispute was for an "apparatus for simulating flames". The apparatus was a feature of certain electric heaters and was designed to simulate the visual effect of real flames.

The applicant was unsuccessful before me as far as its claims for infringement of the Patent were concerned. However, on appeal, the Full Court concluded that the Patent had been infringed and upheld the appeal ( Bitech Engineering v Garth Living Pty Ltd [2010] FCAFC 75).

The primary Judge found that the respondents' heaters did not infringe the patent, and made orders dismissing each application. His Honour also determined that the patent was not invalid, and dismissed the cross-claims. In substance, his Honour ordered Bitech to pay the respondents' costs in relation to infringement. His Honour reserved the question of costs in the proceeding against Flameglow pending the determination of an appeal, as Flameglow had been placed in liquidation, and its cross-claim based on unjustifiable threats remained unresolved: see Bitech Engineering v Garth Living Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 1460 at [34] - [62] and the orders made by the primary Judge in NSD 105 of 2007 on 3 February 2010.
