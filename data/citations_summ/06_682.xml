Although for the reasons set out in my judgment I have not finally answered the question whether the plaintiff is entitled to rely on the sending of the letters in question as alleged negligence, a great deal of work bearing on that question has been done on all sides, and it will all remain available for the consideration of the trial judge. Had the question been duly isolated as a preliminary question and answered in favour of one party or the other, the successful party would have had a sound basis for seeking the costs, or at least part of the costs, of the exercise. [44] I was very comfortably satisfied of the arguability of the plaintiff's position. </sentence>
