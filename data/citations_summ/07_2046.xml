<citances>
<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 223">As a matter of general principle, it is also the case that procedural fairness does not require a decision-maker to disclose every aspect of the decision-making process. In F. Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co. A.G. and Ors v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] A.C. 295 (" Hoffman-La Roche "), Lord Diplock there observed at 369: 
 
 ... the rules of natural justice do not require the decision maker to disclose what he is minded to decide so that the parties may have a further opportunity of criticising his mental processes before he reaches a final decision. If this were a rule of natural justice only the most talkative of judges would satisfy it and trial by jury would have to be abolished. 
 

 
There is no general requirement to give a party a "running commentary on his prospects of success, warning him of every reason why his claims might not be thought sufficient to justify" the relief sought: Applicant S214 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 375 at [32] , [2006] FCA 375 ; 90 ALD 632 at 641 per Edmonds J (referring to what Gleeson CJ and Hayne J had said in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 at [31] , 206 CLR 57 at 69). See also Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591 to 592; Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046 at [10] [2007] FCA 2046 ; , 47 AAR 314 at 317.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 935">And there is no requirement imposed upon the Tribunal to afford a party any opportunity to comment upon proposed findings that it may make: WAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 912 per French J, as His Honour then was, at [36]. There is no such obligation imposed by the common law: Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046 , 47 AAR 314 , applying F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Company AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 at 369 per Diplock LJ. Nor does " information " for the purposes of s 424A " encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ": SZEEU , supra , at [206]. In SZBYR , supra , Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ observed (citations omitted): 
 [18] ... if the reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the Tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting "information" within the meaning of par (a) of s 424A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 936">If the weight to be given to any particular document or letter is to be affected by reasons other than those previously canvassed during the hearing, it is obviously a far preferable course for those other reasons to be disclosed and an opportunity expressly provided to respond to those reasons. Once such an opportunity has been provided, it is thereafter a matter for the Tribunal alone to give to the evidence before it such weight as it sees fit ( Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 291 to 292 per Kirby J), consistent with its duty to undertake a hearing de novo : ( SBLF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA [2008] FCA 1219 ; 1219 , 103 ALD 566 per Gray J). However, no requirement is imposed upon the Tribunal to allow an applicant an opportunity to comment upon what are essentially its own thought processes ( SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18] , [2007] HCA 26 ; 96 ALD 1 at 8, approving VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 at [24] , [2004] FCAFC 123 ; 206 ALR 471 at 476 to 477 per Finn and Stone JJ; WAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 912 per French J, as His Honour then was, at [36]; Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046, 47 AAR 314. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 528">There, the tribunal had referred to five previous decisions of the tribunal in which passages from certain documents were either set out or summarised. Marshall and Lander JJ said there was nothing to suggest that the tribunal failed to comply with s 39(1) merely by referring to a previous (tribunal) decision. They concluded that the previous decisions did not play any part in the tribunal reaching its decision in the matter: Scorgie [2008] FCAFC 101 at [41] . The Full Court approved ( Scorgie [2008] FCAFC 101 at [42] , [67] and [71]) of what the trial judge, Flick J, had said as to the position at common law ( Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046 ; [2007] 47 AAR 314 at [7] ), namely that a denial of procedural fairness would not be established simply because a decision-maker had referred to evidence given in other proceedings in which he or she had been involved. He said that denial of procedural fairness may be made out if the decision-maker went beyond simply referring to evidence in other proceedings and sought to rely upon that evidence or conclusions previously reached without affording an affected party an opportunity to make submissions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 1247">Mrs Sirtes of Counsel, who appeared for the Minister, made these submissions: There was no breach of the rules of procedural fairness and natural justice; The Tribunal's procedural fairness obligations are set out in Division 4 of Part 7 of the Act, which are an exhaustive statement by reason of the operation of s.422B ; The Tribunal complied with s.424A ; The Applicant did not provide any particulars of the procedures claimed by the applicant's Ground 2 not to have been observed; The Applicant did not provide any particulars of the requirements of the Act and Regulations claimed by Ground 3 to have been breached and, in addition, it is not possible for the applicant to press the merits of his claim; The use of older Independent Country Information is not, in itself, a matter which constitutes jurisdictional error ( VQAB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [22] ); The range of sources from which the Tribunal obtained the information it used was a matter for the Tribunal ( SZJHP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [23] ); If the allegation in Ground 5 that the Tribunal had a "pre-set" mind is an allegation of bias, it should be explicitly set out and the Applicant should provide evidence; If the Applicant claims that the Tribunal brought to its decision some aspect of prior experience or material gleaned from previous hearings to assess the plausibility of the Applicant's evidence, this is not an error ( Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [24] ); and The Applicant's Ground 6 is a "pro forma" ground. Counsel for the Minister referred to an earlier decision of mine, SZCKB v Minister for Immigration and Anor [25] , where I characterised an application containing this ground as amounting to "no more than specious nonsense" and being entirely without merit [26] . In fairness to this Applicant, I should make it clear that the application in SZCKB was dismissed as an abuse of process, which is certainly not the case here.  Counsel for the Minister has also referred to the decision of Flick J in Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [42] in support of the proposition that it is not an error for the Tribunal to bring to its decision some aspect of prior experience or material gleaned from previous hearings to assess the plausibility of the Applicant's evidence. I am not certain that this is what the Applicant is claiming, and he did not make any submissions on this specific point.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCAFC 101">60 At the hearing before the primary judge no submissions were addressed to the appeal. Attention was given instead to the jurisdictional challenges. Mr Scorgie's jurisdictional challenges were dismissed by the primary judge on 7 December 2007 ( Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046). He observed that no argument had been addressed to the notice of appeal but that it would in any event have been dismissed for non-compliance with Order 53 rule 3(2) of the Federal Court Rules (which deals with what a notice of such an appeal must state).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 709">Further Mr Cleary referred to the observations of Flick J in Scorgie v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046 at [10] : [10] Procedural fairness does not require the disclosure to a party of the manner in which material may be used or disclosure of an evolving process of deliberation or decision-making. Procedural fairness does not generally require a decision-maker to disclose what he is minded to decide so that a party may have a further opportunity of criticising his mental processes before he reaches a decision: see Hoffman-La Roche v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1974] 2 All ER 1128. Lord Diplock there observed at 1157: ... the rules of natural justice do not require the decision-maker to disclose what he is minded to decide so that the parties may have a further opportunity of criticising his mental processes before he reaches a final decision. If this were a rule of natural justice only the most talkative of judges would satisfy it and trial by jury would have to be abolished. There is no general requirement to give a party a running commentary on his prospects of success warning him of every reason why his claims might not be thought sufficient to justify the relief sought: see Applicant S 214 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 375 at [32] per Edmonds J, 90 ALD 362 , citing Abebe v Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 at [187] [1999] HCA 14 ; , 197 CLR 510. See also Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591---2. In the circumstances of the present proceedings, there has accordingly been no denial of procedural fairness in not disclosing the various texts not referred to in the reason of the Tribunal now under appeal but in the reason of earlier Tribunal decisions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] AATA 28">The multiplicity of medical and psychological problems from which Ms Au suffers inevitably raises the possibility that Mr Lin's commitment to her is more a function of her citizenship than of her personal qualities. There are, of course, self-sacrificing spouses in the world, but Mr Lin's prior record of unscrupulous and deceptive migration behaviour means that one cannot automatically assume that he is one of them. Such cases raise the possibility, on the basis of similar cases in the past, that once the visa applicant obtains permanent residency he could end the marriage and abandon Ms Au (see Re Scorgie and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] AATA 1654 at [99] upheld on appeal in Scorgie v Minister for Immigraton and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046 ; Re Howard and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] AATA 474 at [76] to [77]). </sentence>
