<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 81">Mr Calabretta's evidence was that, after conducting all company, director and conflict searches, he completed and executed a consent to act as voluntary administrator of the defendant. No point was taken at the hearing about the fact that this written consent was given on 2 October 2009, plainly after the purported appointment by the defendant of Mr Calabretta as administrator: see s 448A of the Act. This may itself be a ground for impugning Mr Calabretta's appointment: Gould v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2009] FCA 475 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 648. However, as the point was not taken by any interested party, and as no submissions have been made in relation to it, I will simply note that it may have constituted an independent ground for holding that the appointment was not valid. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1017">The orders were consequential upon two earlier judgments that I have given in this proceeding and another related proceeding: Gould v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2009] FCA 475 and Gould v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board (No 2) [2009] FCA 846 (together, Earlier Reasons for Judgment). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 626">In the present case, counsel for the Applicant submitted that pursuant to s 1321 of the Act, the Court should reverse the decision of the First Respondent to refuse to exercise his casting vote, order that the Respondents be removed as the liquidators of the Company and, in their stead, appoint Mr Slattery as the Company's liquidator. In support of that application, Counsel for the Applicant relied upon the following facts and matters: the Applicant accounted for 99.8% of the Company's indebtedness and was the only truly independent creditor: see [6] above. CIA was a related entity of the Company and there was no material before the Court concerning the relationship, if any, between DLC Consultants and Mr Turner; the Applicant was willing to provide an indemnity to Mr Slattery but not to the current liquidators --- the Respondents; although the Code was not the law, it was permissible to test performance of the First Respondent against the Code (eg Gould v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2009] FCA 475 at [49] and Dean-Willcocks v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2006] FCA 555 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 698 at [21] - [34] ) and the First Respondent did not properly comply with it because he did not properly turn his mind to how the casting vote was to be exercised consistent with the matters identified in the Code. Of particular significance was the alleged failure of the First Respondent to turn his mind to the matters set out in paras 1 and 2 above. 
The Applicant did not challenge the Respondents' competency or their independence. </sentence>
