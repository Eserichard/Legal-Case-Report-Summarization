<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 302">That this principle applies in relation to decisions of the Tribunal appears settled law: Comcare Australia v Grimes [1994] FCA 1054 at [24] , Cheung v AAT [2009] FCA 241 at [49] . In affirming the principle, the Full Court in Morales v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 334 ; (1998) 82 FCR 374 said at 390: 
 In our view, the essentially administrative nature of the Tribunal's function and the nature of its task in looking to the correct or preferable decision, in circumstances where it is to have regard amongst other things to the dictates of fairness, point to the conclusion that the Tribunal may, in appropriate circumstances, conclude that a previous decision should be applied again as the correct and preferable decision when it is sought to revisit the earlier decision at some later time. Of course, the circumstance that a Court has set aside an entire decision may mean that it is either impermissible, or quite inappropriate, to adopt such a course but that would not necessarily be the case where, as here, a particular determination had not itself been the subject of challenge. 

 
 In the present case, we think it was open to Purvis J, having considered all the relevant circumstances, to regard the previous decision of Mr McMahon as determinative of the s 501(2) issue and to decide that this issue should not be reopened. Of course, his Honour might have concluded that this course was not appropriate in the circumstances; but it was a matter of discretion and his Honour's reasons lead us to conclude that he did not see himself as having such discretion. In this respect there was an error of law.
