<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 291">The only guidance the DFRDB Act provides is the direction that the person 'must, before resuming service, in writing addressed to the Authority, elect whether or not to become a member of [the MSB Scheme]. ' The election to be made under 61B(3) for the purposes of the DFRDB Act and the MSB Act is a statutory right to opt out of the default MSB Scheme. This is a right that requires the exercise of choice. It is crystal clear that section 61B(3) imposes express limits on the exercise of that choice, once properly preconditioned, concerning the manner and the timeframe of the election, where failure to comply, or failure to elect, will result in the default statutory scheme being applied [21] . The election is to be made prior to the resumption of a period of service and it is to be in writing and addressed to the Authority. Satisfaction of these requirements does not require service of the written election on the Authority prior to the commencement of the period of service; service is not expressly or impliedly required by the section, nor do the objects and purposes of the DFRDB Act and the MSB Act require it. Nevertheless, for the election to be effective, it must be communicated to the Authority prior to the commencement of the particular period of service. I would not proceed too readily to accept any further limit on the exercise of the statutory right without express provision in the terms of the DFRDB Act or the MSB Act.  In reference to section 6(2) of the MSB Act, I note in passing that an 'eligible member of the Defence Force' is defined by section 3 of the DFRDB Act, but does not include a person who is excluded by operation of section 5A of that Act. Section 5A excludes a person who becomes a member of the Defence Force after 1 October 1991 or a member of a Reserve giving continuous full-time service of not less than 12 months after that date unless the person, relevantly, has made an election under section 61B. Following Chapman v Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority [15] and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority v Gregory [16] , paragraph 5A(1)(a) applies to Captain Marston's resumption of service on 4 January 2010 as a member of the Army Reserve. By operation of sections 4 , 30 and 31 of the Defence Act 1903 , on resuming service in the Army Reserve he became, again, a member of the Defence Force. Thus, section 6 of the MSB Act and paragraph 5A(1)(a) of the DFRDB Act will apply unless Captain Marston elected not to become a member of the MSB Scheme prior to resuming service, whereupon the exclusions in paragraph 5A(2)(b) of the DFRDB Act and paragraph 6(1)(c) of the MSB Act would have effect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 160">It is convenient to commence by considering some of the authorities. The consequences of failing to make an election under s 61B of the old scheme were considered in detail in Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority v Gregory [2009] FCA 875 ; (2009) 179 FCR 535. In that case the respondent had served for more than twenty years in continuous full time service in the regular Army and retired on 28 October 2001. He transferred to the Army Reserve and was entitled to receive retirement benefits under the old scheme as a "recipient member" (s 23 of the DFRDB Act). Subsequently, on three separate occasions between 2003 and 2006, he resumed continuous full time service. When the respondent resumed service in 2003 he did not provide a written notice under s 61B(3) and, in default of notification he became by operation of s 5A(1)(a) of the DFRDB Act and s 6 of the MSB Act a contributing member of the new scheme. Due to an administrative error the respondent's pension was not suspended and he was paid $37,472. The respondent claimed that when he resumed service for four months he became an "eligible member of the Defence Force" under s 3(1) of the DFRDB Act and asserted that s 6(2) of the MSB Act operated to exclude him from the new scheme. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 548">The Respondent's position was straightforward: CDR Mathews had failed to make an election with respect to his preferred scheme before embarking upon his (third period) of CFTS. It relied on Strutt and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority [2007] AATA 1614 , where the Tribunal held to the effect that the failure to make a scheme election prior to resuming CFTS resulted in the person becoming a member of the MSB Scheme by operation of the law. Further, in Gregory and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority [2008] AATA 1053 , the Tribunal decided that there was no discretion to allow an Applicant to make a retrospective election whether or not to join the MSB Scheme or remain in the DFRDB scheme. The same view was expressed in Williams and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority [2008] AATA 585. This interpretation of the DFRDB Act re-entry provisions has recently been confirmed by the Federal Court in Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority v Gregory [2009] FCA 875. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 820">Mr Dillon relied on a recent decision of the Federal Court in Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority v Gregory [2009] FCA 875 delivered on 18 August 2009 ( Gregory ) and contended that by reason of the applicant resuming the second period, it being for less than 12 months, he was not an eligible member of the DFRDB Scheme by reason of not having made an election and he was therefore deemed to be a member of the MSB Scheme pursuant to s 6 of the MSB Act. Accordingly, the applicant had no entitlement under the DFRDB Scheme and the respondent was entitled to recover retirement pay made under the DFRDB Scheme (and which was paid until 14 August 2008). </sentence>
