<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] QCA 315">Mr Cockrell did not mention in his application or written submissions that he has been engaged in protracted litigation in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, [1] the Federal Court of Australia, [2] and the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 444">The Minister, in fact, reached that conclusion and determined consequently to revoke his visa. Mr Cockrell's application for a review of that decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was unsuccessful: see Cockrell v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] AATA 67. An appeal to this Court was rejected on 20 November 2007: see Cockrell v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1779 ; (2007) 100 ALD 52. A further appeal to the Full Court of this Court met the same fate on 5 September 2008: see Cockrell v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 160 ; (2008) 171 FCR 345. On 11 February 2009 Gummow and Kiefel JJ dismissed Mr Cockrell's application for special leave to appeal: Cockrell v Minister for Immigration [2009] HCASL 2 at [10]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 436">Mr Cockrell brought proceedings in this Court, when represented by counsel, which were decided by Besanko J: Cockrell v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1779 ; (2007) 100 ALD 52. An appeal to the Full Court of this Court was dismissed in September last year: Cockrell v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 160 ; (2008) 171 FCR 345. On 11 February 2009 Gummow and Kiefel JJ refused special leave to Mr Cockrell to appeal against the Full Court's decision: Cockrell v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] HCASL 2. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1609">The trial judge had there rejected the argument as follows:
 [53] I do not think the Tribunal member was bound to consider hardship to the applicant himself. It is possible that in any event he did so when considering the best interests of [the Applicant's son], but even if he did not, he did not err in law in not doing so. ...: Cockrell v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1779 , 100 ALD 52. An appeal was dismissed. Gray, Finn and Mansfield JJ relevantly concluded:
 [31] Counsel for the appellant did not refer the Court to any other document, or transcript of evidence, in which any evidence or submission of hardship to the appellant was put before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCAFC 160">1 This appeal from a judgment of a single judge of this Court in Cockrell v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1779 (2007) 100 ALD 52 raises three issues. All are concerned with the decision of the second respondent, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") in Re Cockrell and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] AATA 67 , to affirm the decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (now the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the first respondent) (in both cases "the Minister") to cancel the visa of the appellant, pursuant to s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act "). Section 501(2) provides that the Minister may cancel a visa if the Minister reasonably suspects that its holder does not pass the character test and the holder does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test.</sentence>
