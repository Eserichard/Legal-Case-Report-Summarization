<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 803">In making these submissions, Mr Abbott relied upon the decisions in: Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations v Barker (1997) 81 FCR 53 ; [1997] FCA 1489 ; Lim v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2008] FCA 1752 ; and Gazal Apparel Pty Ltd v Davies (2007) 247 LSJS 391 ; [2007] SASC 91. Finally, Mr Abbott submitted that the Act draws an important distinction between the position of the Chair of the Board and the role of the Chair, or another person, presiding at a Board meeting, because the Chair of the Board has a large number of other functions under the Act, including those under ss 7D, 7F, 7G, 7J, 9 (2) to (4), 9 (6) and 9 (8), 46A(2B), 55A, 55B, 55C, 59 and 61. This, he submitted, demonstrated that a Deputy Commissioner of Police appointed under s 19 of the AFP Act could not take on the Commissioner's role as Chair of the Board and thus, discharge all these functions, anymore than he could discharge the function of presiding at a meeting of the Board. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 553">In my opinion, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is mentioned or referred to in the ACC Act in general terms , such that the deeming provision in s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act is engaged. I have reached that conclusion for a number of reasons. First, there are some authorities that touch on s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act and, so far as they go, they suggest that there is no distinction of the type advanced by the applicant: Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories (Aust) Ltd v Secretary, Department of Community Services and Health [1989] FCA 384 ; (1990) 22 FCR 73 at 75 per Gummow J; Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations v Barker [1997] FCA 1489 ; (1997) 81 FCR 53 ; Lim v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2008] FCA 1752 at [44] per Bennett J; Gazal Apparel Pty Ltd v Davies (2007) 247 LSJS 391 at 396 [35] per Doyle CJ. Secondly, the subject of what is to be mentioned or referred to in general terms is not the office or position itself, but the person holding or occupying a particular office or position. There is no reason why that should be restricted only to those cases where the person is a member of a class of persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1115">The Tribunal in considering the delegation issue stated "It is claims [sic] that there was not an instrument of authority or something that gave them [MatchWorks] the legal authority to act for Centrelink. I am not persuaded that this is the case at all". However, there was no evidence before the Tribunal to support this finding. In contrast to the circumstances considered by Bennett J in Lim v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2008] FCA 1752 at [19] , the respondent did not adduce any evidence before the Tribunal to demonstrate which of the arrangements referred to in cl 3 applies to MatchWorks's activities on behalf of the respondent; see also Piotto at [17]---[20]. Also the respondent has not adduced evidence to demonstrate that the relevant employees of MatchWorks were officers of an Employment Services Provider for the purposes of s 23(1) of the Act; see Lim at [19] and Piotto at [19]---[20]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1116">In Lim v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2008] FCA 1752 at [41] , Bennett J observed that there is no requirement for the employees of Employment Service Providers to identify the basis of their delegated power before signing a Newstart Activity Agreement with a job seeker. Justice Bennett considered the crucial issue to be whether a valid delegation had been made. </sentence>
