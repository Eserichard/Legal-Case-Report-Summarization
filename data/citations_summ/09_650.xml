<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 557">In the circumstances of the present case, deterrence, both specific and general, is an important consideration. As was the case in BHP Steel , the present contempt by the CFMEU was "public, serious and substantial. " It involved a conscious decision to ignore orders made by the Court and to use the financial resources of the union to satisfy any pecuniary penalty imposed. A meaningful penalty must be imposed in order to attempt to deter the CFMEU, and others who, but for the risk of a high penalty, may be tempted to emulate that union's flagrant disregard of Court orders. The fact that a contemnor has incurred legal expenses in defending charges is to be borne in mind when a penalty is determined, but this consideration does not, as I held in Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 650 at [40] , weigh heavily in mitigation of penalty.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 120">81 We should also say something about his Honour's observation that the Union was not a profit-making body and was ultimately funded by its members. It appears that his Honour was influenced by the fact that any monetary penalty imposed on the Union would have to be paid out of funds subscribed by the members. Any funds applied to meet penalties imposed by the Court would not then be available to be used for purposes which would be of direct benefit to the members. Such will always be the case whenever a Union is penalised for a contravention of some statutory provision. This consideration cannot weigh heavily in mitigation of penalty. Where, as is presently the case, a Union adopts a policy, and seeks to take deliberate action which contravenes a statutory provision and that action is undertaken by officials of the Union in the course of their duties, responsibility lies with the officials who choose to act unlawfully. It is the members who elect the officials and those who constitute the Union's policy-making bodies. The remedy, insofar as there is one, lies elsewhere. Members who are dissatisfied with such conduct can stand or vote against the miscreant officials when next they offer themselves for re-election: see Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 650 at [21] .</sentence>
