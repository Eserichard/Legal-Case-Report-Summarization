These submissions are not disputed by the applicants. Indeed I note that both applicants and respondents retained senior counsel, and engaged experts to provide expert evidence including forensic and valuation evidence. However, whether these costs were incurred for the proper attainment of justice and enforcing the respondents' rights is, in default of agreement, a matter for the taxing officer under O 62 r 19 Federal Court Rules rather than this Court: Fubilan Catering Services Ltd v Compass Group (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1497 at [2] .
