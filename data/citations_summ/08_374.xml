<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 395">The maximum penalty of 12 months' imprisonment reflects Parliament's view that "the provision of false information in response to a s 155 notice is a serious offence"; see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v GIA Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1298 at [19] per Heerey J, see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rana [2008] FCA 374 at [50] per North J. Considerations relevant to penalty
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 435">15 At [49] to [50] of Rana [2008] FCA 374 there is a discussion about the importance of compliance with s 155 of the Act. These reasons will not set those sections out but rely upon that discussion to inform the sentencing in this case. 6 On 17 December 2007, an application for bail was made on Micheal Rana's behalf and was refused in view of the uncertainty that he would appear to answer the charge. In circumstances described at [33] to [35] of Rana [2008] FCA 374 , the hearing of the charge was eventually listed for 22 December 2007. 16 Importantly in this case is the evidence which was given on behalf of the prosecution by Mr Small, which is described at [47] of Rana [2008] FCA 374. That evidence demonstrates the sad and pernicious effects of the offending conduct on vulnerable people. Whilst Micheal Rana in cross-examination indicated some acceptance of responsibility for that, it is not entirely clear that his attitude as expressed was entirely genuine. This is especially so when weighed against some of Micheal Rana's other answers which suggested or expressed the view that the clinics operated by the various NuEra companies were misunderstood and in fact provided soothing and valuable services to those that attended. 11 A constant theme in much of Micheal Rana's evidence was related to the influence of his father and the fact that he had both failed to respond to the notice, and also sought to thwart the processes of the Court by the filing of the nonsensical documents referred to in the reasons for judgment delivered in Rana [2008] FCA 374 , as a result of the influence of his father. At the conclusion of that evidence, the Court indicated that it may be assisted in understanding more about Micheal Rana's attitude to his wrongdoing with the assistance of an expert report. Mr Samargis obtained instructions and proceeded with the obtaining of such a report. Indeed, the report was produced in very short time.  3 The hearing of that charge was preceded by a number of directions hearings in which the Court ordered that any affidavits to be relied upon by the parties would be filed according to a timetable stipulated. Documents were filed by Micheal Rana as well as by his father, Paul Rana. The contents of those documents and the circumstances in which they were filed are set out at [6] to [37] of the reasons for judgment in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rana [2008] FCA 374 ( Rana ). They should be read in these reasons as if set out in full to the extent that they relate to Micheal Rana.</sentence>
