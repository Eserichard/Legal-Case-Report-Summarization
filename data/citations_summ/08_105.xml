<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 72">Sometimes, even though the tribunal applies an incorrect statutory test, it can be seen that the same issues would have fallen for consideration had the correct statutory test been applied and that, given the findings of fact made by the tribunal, the same decision must necessarily have resulted. In those circumstances an order remitting the matter to the tribunal would be an exercise in futility. In Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations v Holmes [2008] FCA 105 ; (2008) 168 FCR 301 I dismissed the Secretary's appeal on just such a basis. In so doing and by reference to earlier authority I observed (at [66] to [67]): There is a limited class of case in which an error of law does not vitiate the Tribunal's decision such that, without violating the role consigned to it in an appeal on a question of law, the Court may, in determining the appeal, dismiss the appeal. The authorities concerning this class of case were collected and discussed by Sackville J in Morales v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 60 FCR 550 at 560-561 where his Honour observed:
 
 
 
 
 In certain circumstances, however, the Court may exercise the power in s 44(4) of the AAT Act and make orders finally resolving the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 35">In Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations v Holmes [2008] FCA 105 , Logan J said (at paragraph 35): 
 
 "35. "Marriage-like" means nothing more than resembling a marriage. In this very general sense some meaning, a usual or "normal" meaning, must be given to the word "marriage". In considering what this meaning might be the learned senior member evidently gained assistance from and came to apply a meaning given to the word by Deputy President Forgie in Re VCG and Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations ; [2006] AATA 956 ; (2006) 93 ALD 215 , at 223, [15] in which she observed that a general feature of marriage was "..... a sense of union between two people and a common purpose". That observation by the Deputy President followed a comprehensive survey by her of judicial observations and those in the texts of various religions as to what constituted "marriage". A similar meaning for the word "marriage" is derived by recourse to standard Australian dictionaries, "a lawful union between a man and a woman for life": Macquarie Dictionary, Federation Edition, p. 1172; "the legal union of a man and a woman in order to live together and often to have children": Australian Oxford Dictionary, p. 828. The essential quality of the word, "marriage" is union. "

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 888">The difficulties of preconceptions as to the nature of a marriage are referred to by Logan J and Department of Education, Employment &amp; Workplace Relations v Holmes [2008] FCA 105 ; (2008) 100 ALD 101. Indeed in that case Logan J noted that the purpose of senior member highlighting and culminating upon incidents of violence was to demonstrate how antithetical they were to a notion of a marriage like relationship. Logan J said: [37] Reading the published reasons as a whole, it seems to me that the Tribunal was astute to approach the assessment of the relationship between Mrs Holmes and her husband in this way and without such assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 651">It is worthy to note that the applicant and his former wife were not divorced until July 2006. It follows therefore that until that time they were lawfully married to each other. The applicant did not make the application for divorce. Those proceedings were initiated by his former wife. The legislative criteria for determination of whether persons are a member of a couple within s 4 of the Social Security Act 1991 (the Act) apply to persons who are married to each other and persons who are not legally married to each other (refer Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations v Holmes [2008] FCA 105 at paragraph 15). </sentence>
