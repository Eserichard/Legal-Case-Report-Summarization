<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 156">176 After referring to observations made by Besanko J in Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 746 at [17] , her Honour said that while Vawdrey's infringement was not the most flagrant, it was also not innocent. She stated (at [59] of the Quantum Judgment):
 Vawdrey had indirect access, in circumstances where it should have made reasonable inquiries to confirm the ultimate source and authorization, to the substance of the Krueger Drawings in creating its own drawings as a result of the disclosure by Camerons and used that disclosure to improve its drawings so that it could be awarded and could perform the contract (a non-innocent act of infringement). Then, despite being on notice of the alleged infringing act, it proceeded to manufacture trailers in accordance with the infringing drawings (another non-innocent act of infringement). </sentence>

41 Counsel for the plaintiff referred to Futuretronics.com.au Pty Ltd v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (No. 2) [2008] FCA 746 ; (2008) 76 IPR 763 at 768 [20] where Besanko J said that the second respondent in that case:
 

 
 
 " ... was responsible for producing the brochure on behalf of the first respondent and he knew the artworks on the brochure belonged to the applicant. Despite this knowledge, he went ahead and used them in a brochure designed to promote the first respondent's products. Whether he actually knew that the use of the applicant's artworks was an infringement of copyright is immaterial ( Pollock v JC Williamson Ltd [1923] VicLawRp 34 ; [1923] VLR 225 ; 29 ALR 133) ; the important point is that he knew the artworks were the applicant's artworks or, put a different way, that they belonged to the applicant. Although he attempted to say that he did not know he could not use the applicant's artworks because he was a ' bit vague as to how all this worked' and that he had used samples with the brands of third parties before, I think he knew that he should not be using the artworks or, at least, was wilfully blind to that fact. ..." </sentence>

Futuretronics appeals against the latter award, complaining of its inadequacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 20">21 In the circumstances, I am in a position similar to that of Besanko J in Futuretronics.com.au Pty Ltd v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 746 ; (2008) 76 IPR 763. Like his Honour, I propose to award nominal damages only in the sum of $10.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1592">Vawdrey next submits that, whatever the correct apportionment of the costs liability ought to be, those costs should be awarded against it only on the ordinary party-party basis rather than an indemnity basis. In the quantum judgment, I cited the reasons of Besanko J in Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2 ) [2008] FCA 746 at [17] (which in turn cited Goldberg J's decision in Flags 2000 Pty Ltd v Smith [2003] FCA 1067 ; (2003) 59 IPR 191) for the proposition that a respondent's conduct in its unsuccessful defence of an infringement action may warrant an award of costs against it on an indemnity basis: [2008] FCA 1493 at [58] , [63]. The cited cases, among others, stand as authority for the general proposition that a defendant's conduct in the defence of an action may support an award of indemnity costs where, among other things, the applicant is put to proof of its case unreasonably, the conduct causes undue delay or waste, or the conduct demonstrates wilful disregard of known facts of established law. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1493">30 What then is the proper method for calculating the amount of loss caused by the infringement? Various methods of measuring damages for infringement of copyright have been described: see Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 746 at [11] and TS&amp;B Retail Systems Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 151 ; 158 FCR 444 at [204] - [209] .  58 I come now to Krueger's claim for additional damages. In a claim for additional damages under s 115(4) of the Copyright Act , some general observations were made by Besanko J in Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 746 at [17] :
 
 
 First, there is no need ... to consider if an award of additional damages can be made under s 115(4) [even where] no damages are awarded under s 115(2) because I have awarded ... damages under s 115(2) ( Polygram Pty Ltd v Golden Editions Pty Ltd (No 2) 38 IPR 451 at 459-461 per Lockhart J; MJA Scientifics [International Pty Ltd v S C Johnson and Son Pty Ltd (1998) 43 IPR 275] at 283-284 per Sundberg J). Secondly, it is not necessary that there be a proportionate relationship between the additional damages awarded under subs (4) and the damages awarded under subs (2): Flags 2000 Pty Ltd v Smith [2003] FCA 1067 ; (2003) 59 IPR 191 at 198 per Goldberg J. An award of additional damages under subs (4) is not dependent upon the adequacy or inadequacy of an award of damages under subs (2). Thirdly, the matters in subs (4)(b)(i)-(iv) inclusive are not preconditions to an award of additional damages. In other words, and using the flagrancy of the infringement as an example, the Court must have regard to the flagrancy of the infringement in determining whether to award additional damages, but is not the case that additional damages can be awarded only if the breach involves a particular degree of flagrancy. Fourthly, ...there is a distinction between conduct of a defendant after an infringement (or after being informed that he has allegedly infringed the plaintiff's copyright) and relevant to the substantive allegations against him on the one hand, and the defendant's conduct of his defence to an action for an infringement of copyright in relation to procedural matters on the other. The former matter is within the terms of s 115(4)(b)(ib) of the [Copyright] Act, whereas ... the latter matter is a matter to be taken into account in determining the appropriate order as to costs. ...

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 1465">In Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 746 Besanko J said at [19]: 
 
 The meaning of "the flagrancy of the infringement" has been described in various ways. In Ravenscroft v Herbert and New English Library Limited [1980] RPC 193 Brightman J referred to it as "scandalous conduct, deceit and such like; it includes deliberate and calculated copyright infringement"; in Prior v Lansdowne Press Pty Ltd [1977] VicRp 6 ; [1977] VR 65 at 70, Gowans J (at 70) referred to it as a "calculated disregard of the plaintiff's rights, or cynical pursuit of benefit"; and in Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88 at 103 flagrancy was said to connote conduct which could probably be described as "glaring, notorious, scandalous" or "blatant". In Polygram at 461-462 Lockhart J said that flagrancy did not include mere mistakes or carelessness and that if the infringer mistakenly believed that he or she owned the relevant copyright, or acted in the bona fide belief that no copyright subsisted in the plaintiff's work then the conduct was not flagrant. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 896">17 The matter was also discussed by Shepherd J in Colgate-Palmolive v Cussons [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225. Shepherd J set out six principles or guidelines at 232-234 and I refer to those principles or guidelines. The discretion is a broad one and must be exercised according to the particular circumstances of the case. I have considered the submissions and I have had regard to the matters identified in my reasons as to damages: Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 746 at [24] - [30]. I am not persuaded that the respondents' conduct was of such a nature as to justify an award of costs on an indemnity basis. The applicant was put to proof in relation to its claim for infringement of copyright, but that did not add to the length of the trial in any substantial way.
