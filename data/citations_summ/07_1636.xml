<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 261">The reasons given by the Tribunal member do not suggest that she might have prejudged the application. As the High Court said in Ex parte H, the Tribunal is bound to test the assertions of an applicant. In an inquisitorial proceeding vigorous questioning on the part of the decision-maker does not amount to bias or necessarily create an apprehension of bias. The context is critical: Flaherty v Greyhound Racing Club Ltd (above) at [29]. As Branson J said in SWDB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1636 at [23]: 
 
 Mere discourtesy or abruptness, particularly when not of a severe character, does not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.
