<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1158">8 On 15 March 2006, the applicant filed a notice of appeal in this Court, against the decision of the Federal Magistrate. Middleton J dismissed the appeal: see [2006] FCA 1271. His Honour observed at [18] that:
 
 "The Tribunal simply did not accept the appellant's claims concerning the incidents following the elections in April 2004. It was not satisfied that he was ever harmed as he alleged. The appellant also submitted the Tribunal failed to consider whether the facts as it found them to have occurred led to the conclusion that the appellants had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Refugees Convention reason. However, it is clear to me that the Tribunal did consider the findings of fact and addressed the proper question whether the appellants had a well-founded fear of persecution. The appellant also submitted that the Tribunal misunderstood what follows from its finding that the persecution did not have an 'official' quality. But, as was noted by the Federal Magistrate, this submission did not appear to relate to any findings of the Tribunal in the present case. " 

The High Court subsequently refused to grant the applicant special leave to appeal from his Honour's decision.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 844">In its decision dated 10 August 2006, the Federal Court dismissed the appeal, and it is noted that in its decision, MZXCV &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs &amp; Anor [2006] FCA 1271 , the Court relevantly considered arguments advanced by the Applicants, and indeed further considered other issues not raised before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
