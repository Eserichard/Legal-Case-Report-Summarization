<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 845">A Court which hears, as this one does, a regular diet of penalty proceedings and which, with the aid of experienced counsel appearing for parties and of its own researches, keeps up to date with developments in this specialist field senses, perhaps more acutely than a more generalist Court which only deals with them from time to time, the danger of being accused of citing by rote the matters appropriate to be taken into consideration. A Court could even feel embarrassment at quoting once again the highly relevant and considered views of Buchanan J in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 246 ALR 35 at [91] that: "These matters should not be treated as "a rigid catalogue of matters for attention". The overriding principle is for the Court to "fix penalty which pays appropriate regard to the circumstances in which the contraventions have occurred and the need to sustain public confidence in the statutory regime which imposes the obligation. "" 
The Court is of course sensible of the fact that it is not writing for solely an appellate division but is explaining to those whose conduct has offended the reasons why it has chosen a particular penalty to be imposed. It is for this reason that it is necessary to set out those matters that the Court proposes to take into account even though they have been expressed before in such cases as CFMEU v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at 232 [7-8] per Branson J; Stewart-Mahony v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61 ; Alfred v Wakelin (No 1) [2008] FCA 1455 ; Alfred v Wakelin (No 4) [2009] FCA 267 ; (2009) 180 IR 335 ; Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169. The circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 826">The applicant acknowledged that similar factors have been applied in relation to penalties for unlawful industrial action in contravention of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (the BCII Act) (see Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2008) 177 IR 61 ; [2008] FCA 1426 ; Alfred v Wakelin (No.1) [2008] FCA 1455 at [28] ; and Alfred v Wakelin (No 4) (2009) 180 IR 335 ; [2009] FCA 267 at [15] ), although courts have also taken into account other factors relevant to the particular circumstances of the contraventions in issue (see for example Temple v Powell (2008) 169 FCR 169 ; [2008] FCA 714 at [56] --- [57] per Dowsett J and the discussion of these principles in Fair Work Ombudsman v AWU, NSW [2010] FMCA 744). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 744">There have been a number of authorities which set out what I will describe as " non-exhaustive range of matters " relevant to determining penalty in unlawful industrial action proceedings. The applicant in the instant case refers to those considered by Branson J in CFMEU v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No.2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at 232 [7-8] whereas the respondent refers to those considered by Tracey J in Stuart-Mahoney v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61. Other cases in which these matters have been considered outside the Federal Magistrates Court are Alfred v Wakelin (No.1) [2008] FCA 1455 ; Alfred v Wakelin (No.4) [2009] FCA 267 and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714. As the respondent notes: "These matters should not be treated as " a rigid catalogue of matters for attention "; the overriding principle is for the Court " to fix penalty which pays appropriate regard to the circumstances in which the contraventions have occurred and the need to sustain public confidence in the statutory regime which imposes the obligation "; Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 at [91] per Buchanan J. "  1) [2008] FCA 1455 
Union (previous contraventions; late admission of contraventions): $8,000 (7% of maximum). Individual (no previous contraventions; late admission of contraventions): $1,100 (5% of maximum). Alfred v Wakelin (No 4) [2009] FCA 267 
Unions (penalties assessed as if for one union and then divided between two related union entities; two contraventions penalised; unions treated as having "good prior records"; contraventions not admitted): total $25,000 for first contravention (23% of maximum); total $11,000 for second contravention (10% of maximum). Individual (did not appear in the proceedings): $5,000 for first contravention (23% of maximum); $2,200 for second contravention (10% of maximum). NOTE: the respondents were also separately penalised for contraventions arising under the WR Act.</sentence>
