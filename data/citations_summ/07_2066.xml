<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 144">In recent years, Mr Ugur has represented himself in proceedings before this Tribunal and the Federal Court without the assistance of an interpreter [1] . On a number of occasions when provided with an interpreter, he elected not to use their services [2] . That Mr Ugur participated in proceedings in the past without the assistance of an interpreter is not determinative of the issue I must decide, namely whether he would be denied a reasonable opportunity to present his case in these proceedings, without the assistance of an interpreter. </sentence>
