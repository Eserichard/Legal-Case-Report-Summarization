<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1863">25 In the alternative, TWS submits that the Minister should only be awarded 50% of his costs. The reason for the submission is that two applications where brought challenging the Minister's decisions on substantially identical grounds, one by TWS and one by The Investors for the Future of Tasmania Inc (IFT): see, The Investors for the Future of Tasmania Inc. v Minister for the Environment and Water Resources [2007] FCA 1179. Both cases were heard together and evidence in one was evidence in the other. Therefore, in order to justly compensate the Minister only a 50% award of costs is justified against TWS and likewise a 50% award against IFT.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1864">2 The Court published its judgment in the substantive proceeding on 9 August 2007, dismissing the application wholly in favour of the first and second respondents : see, The Investors for the Future of Tasmania Inc. v Minister for the Environment and Water Resources [2007] FCA 1179. In that judgment, orders as to costs were reserved and an order made that the parties file and serve written submissions on the question of costs within 21 days of the primary judgment. Accordingly, written submissions were received from the parties under an agreed extended timetable. I now set out my reasons regarding the question of costs.</sentence>
