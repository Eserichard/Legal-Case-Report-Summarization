<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 91">2 Representative proceedings were commenced on behalf of the retirees against 19 respondents seeking, amongst other things, to protect their leasehold interests in the properties they had sold. Mostly, the claims were settled. However Perpetual and some of the retirees have not resolved their differences. Perpetual made a number of loans to MFLPH entities to finance the purchase of properties and took first registered mortgages over them. The retirees have claimed that the registered mortgages held by Perpetual were subject to their interests as lessees. Perpetual's position was that it was an innocent third party mortgagee, and that upon registration of its mortgages it obtained indefeasible title. Middleton J gave a series of judgments in the matter generally in favour of the retirees: see Haslam v Money For Living (Aust) Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1536 (the first judgment, given 16 October 2008), Haslam v Money For Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1832 (the second judgment, given 2 December 2008) and Haslam v Money For Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 468 (the third judgment, given 4 May 2009). 
  31 The primary judge's reasons for judgment published on 4 May 2009 ( Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 468) relied on his principal reasons (published on 16 October 2008; Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1536). In his reasons published on 4 May 2009, his Honour said at [6]-[7]:
 No point was made by Perpetual that the Affected Group Members did not come within one or other of the factual circumstances giving rise to the declarations and orders made on 2 December 2008 in respect of the named applicants therein specifically mentioned and considered. I should mention that no party sought to identify specifically which category of factual circumstances previously identified in the Court's earlier reasons covered each Affected Group Member, and no distinguishing feature was sought to be relied upon by Perpetual. This approach of the parties may have ramifications depending upon the result of any appeal, but does not impact upon the appropriateness of making the declarations and orders now sought by the Affected Group Members. On the basis of my previous reasons, the affidavit material before me and the approach taken by Perpetual, I will make the declarations and orders now sought by the Affected Group Members. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSC 162">102 Finally, there is the recent decision of Middleton J in Haslam v Money for Living Aust (Pty Ltd) [100] . This case was one of a number involving retirement plans under which the retirees having sold the family home to an organisation known as Money for Living received, in addition to a payment of cash and the promise of ongoing payments, the right to occupy their property for the remainder of his or her life pursuant to a lease. Each retiree continued to occupy his or her property; Money for Living became the registered proprietor and mortgaged the properties to a financier, Perpetual, which after default by the mortgagor sought to take possession of the retirees' properties. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1832">I agree with Perpetual that the retirees' attempts to obtain the protection of the Transfer of Land Act 1958 (Vic) ('the TLA') and the Land Titles Act 1980 (Tas) ('the LTA') for any such liens failed: see Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (2008) FCA 1536 at [106] . The Court did not actually determine that any retiree possessed a vendor's lien, although that such a lien existed was implicit in the way the proceeding was conducted, and apparent from the evidence before the Court. MFL Property Holdings Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) ('MFLPH') does not oppose the declarations being made in respect of the vendor's lien, and Perpetual never positively contended that the vendor's lien did not exist, only that it would not support the claim to protection under the TLA and LTA. </sentence>
