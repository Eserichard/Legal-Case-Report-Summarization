<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 916">A "security" includes " a share in a body" (s 761A). The term "dealing" is defined to include applying for or requiring, or issuing, a security (s 766C(1)). Having regard to s 1041H(2) , in Donald Financial Enterprises Pty Ltd v APIR Systems Ltd [2008] FCA 1112 ( Donald Financial Enterprises ) Edmonds J at [176], considered it clear that s 1041H applied to conduct which consisted of the applicant's application for and respondent's issues of shares as well as the applicant's acquisition of shares from an existing shareholder. The force of this finding, with which I agree, is emphasised by the breadth of the words "in relation to" that appear in s 1041H(1). They are words with a very expansive meaning: see Tooheys Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties [1961] HCA 35 ; (1961) 105 CLR 602 at 620.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1448">55 In any event, I think that there is real difficulty with the proposition that his Honour approached his consideration of the appropriate relief to be granted in the present case upon the basis that, were damages to be awarded, those damages would be expectation damages. His Honour's remarks at [188] of his Reasons ( Donald Financial Enterprises Pty Ltd v APIR Systems Ltd [2008] FCA 1112) have to be read in context and in light of the arguments advanced to his Honour by the appellants at trial. 17 His Honour held as follows ( Donald Financial Enterprises Pty Ltd v APIR Systems Ltd [2008] FCA 1112 at [190] ):
 In the present case, while the number of shares that might be issued in discharge of the completion payment under the second heads of agreement has a floor --- 100,000 for each executive director --- it has no ceiling, so that the number of shares that might be issued is potentially unlimited depending on the value of the APIR shares at the relevant time. In context, such an event, post acquisition, is a cause inherent in the thing itself --- the second heads of agreement --- and not extrinsic or independent of it, and should be taken into account in any assessment of the real value of the shares at the time of acquisition. This makes any assessment of loss or damage, other than for the full subscription/purchase price, exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.  56 It must be remembered that his Honour did not award damages to the respondent but, rather, reversed the transactions. His Honour did so because his Honour also held that any assessment of loss or damage which involved the respondent keeping the shares was "... exceedingly difficult, if not impossible" (see Donald Financial Enterprises Pty Ltd v APIR Systems Ltd [2008] FCA 1112 at [190] ). </sentence>
