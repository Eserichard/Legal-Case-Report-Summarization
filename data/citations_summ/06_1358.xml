<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1106">VIP relies upon Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Lundbeck Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1358 and InterPharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1422. In those cases the Court considered an application for inclusion of in-house counsel in a confidentiality regime. In each case inclusion was permitted. In those cases the Court had regard in particular to the risk of inadvertent disclosure balanced against the benefits of providing access to documents to in-house counsel so that proper advice and instructions could flow to and from the client. </sentence>
