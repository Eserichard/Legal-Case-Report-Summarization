6. This court has also an implied, if not inherent, power as a superior court of record to correct any clerical mistake in a judgment, decree or order, if it were the result of an accidental slip or omission: Storey &amp; Keers Pty Ltd v Johnstone (1987) 9 NSWLR 446 at 452F-G per McHugh JA; The Food Improvers Pty Ltd v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd (No 5) [2007] FCA 466 at [5] per myself. 7.

 THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 
 The accused appear before the Court on 30 July 2009 at 9.30am for a directions hearing and in relation to obtaining a pre-sentence report.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FamCA 1353">So too was Rowe v Delfs [1966] WAR 49 where Hale J varied an earlier order by including a certificate for the cost of transcript which counsel had omitted to ask for. I am satisfied then that the court is empowered to grant the relief which the respondents seek. I am also satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order amending the order made on 6 November 1987 by including provision that the applicants pay the respondents' costs of that summons...
