<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1096">In some of the cases considered above, reference is made to disclosure of confidential information to legal advisers subject to appropriate undertakings. Such undertakings were offered in the present case. There are many cases in which access has been denied to legal advisers who have offered undertakings on the ground that the risk to national security flowing from inadvertent disclosure is simply too high. There is an elaborate discussion of this risk in Regina v Khazaal [2006] NSWSC at [31]-[39]. See also Traljesic v Attorney-General (Cth) [2006] FCA 125 ; (2006) 150 FCR 199 at [22] - [23]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 128">49 During the course of argument, Mr Burnside acknowledged that the applicant could have sought relief of this nature against the Attorney-General's decision, referring to a decision of Rares J in Traljesic v Attorney-General (Cth) [2006] FCA 125 ; (2006) 150 FCR 199. He submitted, however, that this should not dictate the outcome of the present application before us. Mr Gageler also accepted that the applicant could have challenged the Attorney-General's decision to issue the certificates, and that a consequence of any such challenge might have been disclosure of the certified material.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] WASC 196">18 Mr Howe QC submitted that the Court should consider the confidential material in the closed affidavit that has not been disclosed to the plaintiff and then in the course of determining the plaintiff's application determine whether or not the confidential material in the closed affidavit should be disclosed to the plaintiff. Mr Howe cited as authority for his proposition Alister v The Queen [1983] HCA 45; (1984) 154 CLR 404 ; Traljesic v Attorney-General (Cth) [2006] FCA 125 ; Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith (1996) 86 A Crim R 308 at 310; R v Francis [2004] NSWCCA 85; [2004] NSWCCA 85 ; (2004) 145 A Crim R 233 at [21] ; R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 596 ; R v Khazaal [2006] NSWSC 1061 ; Jackson v Wells [1985] FCA 100 ; (1985) 5 FCR 296 ; National Crime Authority v Gould [1989] FCA 477 ; (1989) 23 FCR 191 at 198 and R v Fandakis [2002] NSWCCA 5.
