<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1498">I am satisfied that the proposed orders that have been freely agreed to by all of the parties on an informed basis are appropriate. There are now a number of decisions of this Court that have considered the requirements of this section of the Act that promotes a resolution of native title applications by way of negotiated agreement. Justice Greenwood, in Deborah Hobson and Ors on behalf of the Kuuku Ya'u People v State of Queensland [2009] FCA 679 at [12] referred to the observations made by Chief Justice French in his paper, Lifting the Burden of Native Title --- Some Modest proposals for Improvement , that the Court will not lightly second-guess the agreement the parties have reached by requiring formal proof of the content of the subject matter of each proposition contained in the proposed orders which in turn must necessarily address the elements of ss 223 and 225 of the Act. Otherwise the Applicant would be burdened with, in effect, a subset of a trial in establishing the appropriateness of consensual orders. Consideration of Agreement and Draft Determination
