<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1021">The Respondents submit this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine this appeal because the appeal does not raise a question of law but invites "a reconsideration of the merits of the [Tribunal's] decision": s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). I reject that contention. Whether a Tribunal took into account irrelevant considerations when exercising a discretion is a question of law: see, by way of example, Kezchek v Secretary, Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs [2009] FCA 856 at [5] --- [6]; Commissioner of Taxation v A Taxpayer (2006) 91 ALD 335 at [50] and Haidar v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1998] FCA 994 ; (1998) 157 ALR 359 at 366. </sentence>
