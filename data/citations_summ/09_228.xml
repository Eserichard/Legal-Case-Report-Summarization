The hearing on the preliminary questions took place on 26 and 27 March 2009. Judgment in Habib (No 2) had been reserved on 10 October 2008 and judgment was delivered by Perram J on 13 March 2009 shortly before the present hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 12">(3) How does the act of state doctrine operate in the Australian constitutional and statutory context? 
 (1) WHAT ISSUES MUST THE COURT DETERMINE? 
 Some undisputed facts 
 
 The undisputed background facts giving rise to Mr Habib's proceeding are recorded in Habib v Commonwealth (No 2) (2009) 175 FCR 350 ; [2009] FCA 228 at [1] - [3] as follows: 
[1] ... On 11 September 2001 a series of terrorists [sic] attacks took place on the mainland of the United States of America ("the US") as a result of which there was significant loss of civilian life. On 9 October 2001, the President of the US wrote to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and informed the Congress that at 12.30 pm on 7 October 2001 US armed forces had commenced combat operations against Al Qaida terrorists and their Taliban supporters in Afghanistan. Pakistan shares a border with Afghanistan. 
 The Commonwealth contends that to determine whether agents of the US, Egypt and Pakistan committed offences against the Crimes (Torture) Act 1988 (Cth) , s 7(1) of the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 (Cth) or ss 268.26 and s 268.74 of the Criminal Code it will inevitably be necessary for this Court to sit in judgment on the acts of the governments of those States done within their own territories, contrary to the proscription in Underhill . Consequently, there should be no trial on the merits and the proceedings should be dismissed. On 13 March 2009 I determined inter alia that the Commonwealth's contention that Mr Habib's proceedings were certain to fail in light of the act of state doctrine was not correct, that there was a triable issue as to whether the doctrine applied and that the matter should proceed: Habib v Commonwealth (No 2) [2009] FCA 228 ; (2009) 175 FCR 350 at 370-371 [80] - [82]. Somewhat exceptionally --- but, it is to be emphasised, with the consent of Mr Habib --- the Commonwealth then successfully sought the stating of a special case to the Full Court posing, on a final basis, the question of whether the act of state doctrine was a complete answer to Mr Habib's contentions. In my opinion, it is not and that the question should be answered "No".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 978">The first question is whether there is matter within ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution . The Courts will abide the Executive's views on questions such as the accession of foreign territory, the recognition of a foreign sovereign or the recognition of foreign states' ambassadors. Generally speaking, the issues that arise between nation states are unlikely to generate matters within the meaning of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution for the rights and obligations do not form part of domestic law. Further, such questions are usually unable to bring forth an applicant who has standing. Complaints about the conduct of Australian international relations are likely to take a court into an area that involves the consideration of undertakings or obligations depending entirely on political sanctions. Where that occurs, there is no matter in the requisite sense (see Habib v The Commonwealth [2009] FCA 228 ; (2009) 175 FCR 350 at [52] ). </sentence>
