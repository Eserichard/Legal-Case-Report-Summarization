<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 991">
 The matter presently before the Court is a Notice of Motion filed by the respondent on 6 June 2008. It is a sequel to two Notices of Motion which were the subject of decision in Bonnell v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 60. The earlier motions were referred to at [46] and [48] of that judgment of 8 February 2008.  Given that the present motion is truly a sequel to the two Notices of Motion which were the subject of decision in Bonnell v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 60 it is inappropriate to recount all of the relevant facts again. The facts and matters and statements of legal principle as recorded in the earlier judgment should be treated as having been restated in full in these reasons. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 483">The Respondent [Bonnell] disputes the judgment debt upon which the applicant [Deputy Commissioner of Taxation]relies in bringing this application as: a) The judgment upon which the Applicant relies is founded upon a purported notice of assessment of income tax ("the assessment"), issued on or about 29 July 2004 which, the Respondent asserts is invalid. b) The Respondent commenced proceedings NSD 1963 of 2006 which are presently before Graham J in the Federal Court, to set aside the Assessment as invalid, and asserts as a consequence that the judgment upon which the Applicant relies is bad and should be set aside. 
Justice Graham of the Federal Court handed down the decision in Bonnell v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 60 on 
8 February 2008. </sentence>
