<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] ATMO 2">Ms Welsh submitted that, with respect to the TPA claims, "the question is whether reasonably minded members of the class of consumers to whom the cutlery not originating from the opponent would be directed would take from the use of the opposed mark an impression that the goods were associated with the opponent", citing Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [5] and Johnson &amp; Johnson Pacific Pty Ltd v Unilever Australia Ltd [6] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 607">It cannot do so. The stamp was given to doctors by Servier's representatives who urged doctors to use it. Servier is directly liable for the misleading representations by putting the stamp into circulation in circumstances where it was intended to be used ( Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 157 ; (2002) 55 IPR 354 ; Johnson &amp; Johnson Pacific Pty Ltd v Unilever Australia Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1646 ; (2006) 70 IPR 574). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1505">7 The Episodes must be considered in their entirety ( Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 199 per Gibbs CJ). That involves taking account of content and presentation and also the circumstances in which the Episodes were broadcast ( Johnson &amp; Johnson Pacific Pty Limited v Unilever Australia Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 1646 ; (2006) 70 IPR 574 at [16] ). The question for the Court is whether reasonably minded viewers would take from the Episodes the representations which are alleged ( Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45). There is no dispute that viewers would be unlikely to engage in a detailed analysis of textual or linguistic nuances. The question is one of the overall impression of each Episode.
