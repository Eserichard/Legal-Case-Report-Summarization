<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 40">45 The question of whether the Tribunal may exercise the power under s 359B(4) to extend the period to respond to an invitation under s 359A after the expiry of the initial prescribed period was left open in Sun at [51]. See also the observations in SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 449 at [46] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 197">The first respondent conceded that the hearing invitation letter of 28 September 1998 contained the defect referred to in ground two of the amended application. Prima facie this means there was a failure to follow a procedure under the Act. Such a failure may constitute jurisdictional error. However the first respondent submitted that in any substantive hearing it would be argued that while this was an error, it did not amount to a jurisdictional error (see Craig v The State of South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163; [1995] HCA 58). It was pointed out that counsel for the applicant had referred generally to the approach of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Sook v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1999) 86 FCR 584 ; [1999] FCA 7 in which an error, such as appears in the hearing invitation letter in the present case, was regarded as a failure to comply with s.426(1) of the Act as it stood at the relevant time. However the applicant in Sook succeeded on review on the ground provided for in the former s.476(1)(a) of the Act, which applied to a failure to observe a procedure required by the Act or Regulations, not on the basis of a claim of jurisdictional error. The first respondent contended that it was arguable in the circumstances of this case that the error in question did not constitute a jurisdictional error and, in any event, that if there was a jurisdictional error involving a failure to comply with the requirement to refer to the seven day period provided in s.426(2) for an applicant to give written notice of witnesses to the Tribunal, this had not been shown to be such as to have had any effect on the applicant's ability to advance any evidence that he wanted to advance or to present his case (see Re Refugee Review Tribunal and Another; Ex parte Aala (2000) 204 CLR 82; [2000] HCA 57 ; SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 449 ; and SZKGF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 84). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 767">In SZNAV Raphael FM considered relevant authorities (at [35] to [42]: SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 449 , per Jacobson J, particularly at [37], [45] to [49]; M v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1247 (" M ") per Tracey J at [28], [32] to [37 ]; SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration [ 2008] FCA 1406 per Buchanan J at [53] to [58]; SZLQH considered with SZLPO, at [137]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 693">It cannot be said that the information was not given before the time for it had passed (s 424C(1)(b)). In my view no 'breach' of s 424B(2) occurred and, in any event, any failure to comply with its strict terms did not, in the circumstances of this case at least, amount to jurisdictional error on the part of the RRT. The Minister's latest written submissions drew attention to judgments of this Court to similar effect ( SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 449 and M v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1247 ; (2006) 155 FCR 333 at [34] - [37] ). " It is noteworthy that his Honour specifically excluded the reasoning in SZKTI, SZKCQ and SZIZO . His Honour gave the principal judgment in SZKCQ where he again discussed the imperative nature of s.424A in contrast with that of s.424 saying at [53] and [54]: "[53] As I earlier indicated, the requirements about the method by which an invitation must be given in s 424(3) are stated in identical terms to the requirements to be found in s 424A(2) about the way in which the RRT must invite an applicant to comment on information which 'would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming a decision that is under review'. SZLPO also confirmed that information is only additional information where it is additional to information previously given by the invitee [88]. There are a number of cases bearing upon whether a breach of s.424B constitutes a jurisdictional error. The matter was first considered by Jacobsen J in SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 449 where an invitation was given to an applicant under s.424B(2) of the Act and an answer requested beyond the 14 day prescribed period fixed by regulation 4.35(3) of the Regulations. The Minister conceded that the invitation was in breach of the section but said that it did not involve jurisdictional error. His Honour contrasted the imperative requirements contained in s.424A before saying at [37]: "Although it is not one of the centrepieces of the statutory scheme, s 424B(2) plays an important part in carrying out the statutory requirement of procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 495">4.35 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) by not specifying the prescribed period. This ground of review must fail because DFAT is not a natural person and, therefore, s.424(2) is inapplicable to requests by the Tribunal of it. Further, the giving of a s.424B(2) letter stipulating a period greater than the prescribed period does not amount to jurisdictional error and, in any event, relief should be refused as a matter of discretion: see SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 449 per Jacobson J at [49] as to it not being a jurisdictional error, and [51] as to the refusal of relief on the basis of discretion. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 103">It cannot be said that the information was not given before the time for it had passed (s 424C(1)(b)). In my view no 'breach' of s 424B(2) occurred and, in any event, any failure to comply with its strict terms did not, in the circumstances of this case at least, amount to jurisdictional error on the part of the RRT.

" Third, the request from the Tribunal did not expressly indicate the way in which the response was to be received [See section 424B(1)(a)]. There are two answers to this argument: It is at least analogously met by the same argument as put in the last above paragraph dealing with SZLWQ .</sentence>

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Application 
 The applicant, who claims to be a citizen of China, asks the Court to set aside a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal made on 11 th March 1999. The Tribunal affirmed a decision of the delegate of the Minister not to grant the applicant a protection visa.  If the application were competent, I would not have exercised the Court's discretion to grant relief for these reasons: the unwarrantable and unexplained delay of over 9 years ( Re Commonwealth of Australia; Ex parte Marks [24] per McHugh J at 495-496; S58 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [25] ), only a fraction of which is explained by the application to the Minister for intervention under s 417; and the fact that the jurisdictional error involving the failure to comply with s 426(1) (b) had no effect on the applicant's ability to advance evidence that he wanted to advance and present his case ( Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala [26] ; SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [27] ; and SZKGF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [28] ) and he had suffered no practical injustice and no procedural unfairness. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 1463">The Minister submits that even if a breach of s.91R(3) were established the Court should exercise its discretion to refuse relief (see SZLWI v Minister for immigration and Citizenship [19] at [44] and [45]). It would be appropriate to decline relief on discretionary grounds because no injustice has occurred ( SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [20] at [50]-[53]; M v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [21] at [38]; SZKGF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [22] at [13]-[16]). Conclusions
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 1348">It cannot be said that the information was not given before the time for it had passed (s.424C(1)(b)). In my view no 'breach' of s.424B(2) occurred and, in any event, any failure to comply with its strict terms did not, in the circumstances of this case at least, amount to jurisdictional error on the part of the RRT. The Minister's latest written submissions drew attention to judgments of this Court to similar effect ( SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 449 and M v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1247 ; (2006) 155 FCR 333 at [34] - [37]). (at [51]-[52]) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1406">It cannot be said that the information was not given before the time for it had passed (s 424C(1)(b)). In my view no 'breach' of s 424B(2) occurred and, in any event, any failure to comply with its strict terms did not, in the circumstances of this case at least, amount to jurisdictional error on the part of the RRT. The Minister's latest written submissions drew attention to judgments of this Court to similar effect ( SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 449 and M v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1247 ; (2006) 155 FCR 333 at [34] - [37]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 1794">34 Whether or not the statutory requirements imposed by ss 424A and 424B are jurisdictional in character has been the subject of prior decisions of this Court. Jacobson J has usefully summarised some of those decisions in SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 449 at [30] ---[49]. As was similarly concluded by Jacobson J, it is not considered that any jurisdictional error is demonstrated in circumstances where there has been a failure to comply with s 424B(4) -- assuming there to be a failure to " extend time " -- but where the additional material has, in fact, been considered. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FMCA 808">M v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1247 ; (2006) 155 FCR 333 at [35] - [38], and SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 449 at [30] - [49]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FMCA 171">However, see also comments in SZEXZ v MIMIA [2006] FCA 449 per Jacobson J at [49] where the applicant received more time than he was entitled to under s 424B(2). [22] Therefore, no jurisdictional error can be disclosed by its refusal to extend time.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] AATA 1118">His Honour also noted that a similar conclusion had been reached by Jacobson J in SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 449 at [49] : 
 
 "I do not see how, having regard to the language of s 424B(2) or the scope of Div 4, a breach which consisted of giving an applicant more time than he or she was entitled to, could be thought to render invalid a decision given after the breach. This must be especially so where the information was provided and a hearing took place in accordance with s425. " 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2006] FCA 1247">A similar conclusion was reached by Jacobson J in SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 449. His Honour was called on to determine whether a breach of s 424B(2) of the Act gave rise to jurisdictional error. Section 424B of the Act is in the same terms as s 359B of the Act and applies to the Refugee Review Tribunal. The Refugee Review Tribunal had sought information from the applicant under s 424 of the Act and the letter requested a response within a period which was longer than that prescribed. His Honour distinguished SAAP having regard to the differences between ss 424A and 424 B of the Act which are the same differences which exist as between ss 359A and 359B of the Act. He concluded (at [49]) that a breach of s 424B(2) of the Act 'which consisted of giving an applicant more time than he or she was entitled to, [did not] render invalid a decision given after the breach'. This, he held, 'must be especially so where the information was provided and a hearing took place in accordance with s 425. ' </sentence>
