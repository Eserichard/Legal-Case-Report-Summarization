<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 209">Under s.425 it is now well established that where an applicant gives a consent within s.425(2)(b) , even after receiving an invitation to an appointed hearing, the Tribunal is entitled to act upon that consent by determining the matter on the papers without waiting until the hearing date (see SZIMG &amp; Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 368 ; [2008] FCA 368 ; (2008) 167 FCR 362 at [19] to [22]). Rares J judgment which contains a clear ruling to this effect, and is binding on this Court, was the subject of a special leave application to the High Court (see SZIMG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] HCASL 437). When refusing leave, Hayne and Crennan JJ said: There is no reason to doubt the correctness of his Honour's decision that the applicant's appeal to the Federal Court should be dismissed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 1025">In the circumstances the Tribunal was presented with two options, or two legal avenues, both in effect leading to the same result. In the circumstances, the applicant advised the Tribunal that he did not wish to attend the hearing. Pursuant to s.425(2)(b) of the Act, the applicant, therefore, at that time gave up his entitlement to appear at a hearing before the Tribunal. This created the circumstance of permitting the Tribunal to proceed to a decision without taking further action, as the applicant no longer had any right of appearing at a hearing before the Tribunal. (See SZIMG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 368 ; (2008) 167 FCR 362 per Rares J at [21] to [22]. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 299">The applicant plainly received this letter from the Tribunal. The applicant has put nothing before the Court to deny that proposition. In any event, it would be difficult to do so, given his return of the "Response to Hearing Invitation" form. In light of the Tribunal's warning contained in its letter, his negative response when viewed in light of s.425(2)(b) and s. 425 (3) means, as submitted by Ms Rayment before the Court, that the effect was not just that the applicant could be said to have failed to attend, but through his action in indicating that he did not wish to attend, the applicant lost his entitlement to appear before the Tribunal. This alone created the circumstance and basis to enable the Tribunal to proceed to a decision without taking any further action. I note and apply relevant authority relied on by the Minister in this regard ( SZIMG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 368 per Rares J at [21]-[22]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 498">Counsel for the Applicant then took the Court to various authorities that had applied the principles in Bhardwaj ( SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1295 per Rares J at [59]; SZIMG v Minister for immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 368 per Rares J at [24]; Keen v Telstra Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 834 ; (2006) 230 ALR 313 per Rares J at [29]; Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No.2) [2007] FCA 1684 per Rares J at [115]). However, none of these cases raised the issue before this Court of the legal effect of a decision affected by error where, upon judicial review of the decision of the administrative body, Constitutional writ relief was refused. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 211">Having been informed by the applicant that he did not wish to attend the hearing, and having been informed that he consented to the Tribunal deciding the review without his attendance at a hearing, s.425(3) of the Act was thereby engaged. At that point, the applicant had no entitlement to attend a hearing and, accordingly, there was no need for the Tribunal to go through the "empty form" of holding a hearing or waiting for the "vacated" hearing date to pass (I refer to SZIMG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 368 per Rares J at [21]. See also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFML [2006] FCAFC 152 [at 64]). </sentence>
