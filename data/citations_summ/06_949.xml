<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 878">Finally, as observed by Allsop J in Silkearl [2006] FCA 949 at [34] , one of the fundamental obligations of any practitioner in the discharge of his or her obligations to the client and the Court is the civil and dispassionate communication with other parties to that litigation. Yesterday in Court Mr Yahalom made allegations to the effect that the respondents, or Mr Nir Avrahami, had been involved in criminal activity in respect of their tax liabilities. Making scandalous accusations and allegations of impropriety against the respondents which were in any event irrelevant to the proceedings yesterday suggests that Mr Yahalom is not a proper person to conduct the proceedings on behalf of the applicant. Conclusion
  Fifth, I am not satisfied that reliable financial information has been produced to the Court explaining why neither the applicant, nor Mr Yahalom who is the applicant's sole director and shareholder, can fund a solicitor to represent the applicant. In this respect I note that while Mr Yahalom may be the alter ego of the applicant, nonetheless as explained by Smithers J in Molnar [1984] FCA 232 ; [1984] 3 FCR 68 when a trader decides to use the corporate form in which to carry on his or her business for the advantages flowing therefrom, the accessibility to the courts by that corporation is conditional as set forth in O 4 r 14(2). The lack of reliable evidence as to the applicant's financial position is a factor which is relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion in relation to applications for leave pursuant to O 4 r 14(2): cf Silkearl Pty Ltd v Ainsworth Game Technology Ltd [2006] FCA 949 at [25] . In this case: substantial evidence was produced by the applicant in April 2010 supporting the proposition that the applicant had significant resources at its disposal; the material tendered yesterday in Court by Mr Yahalom suggested that both the applicant and Mr Yahalom had, at least at the close of the 2008-2009 financial year, significant resources; and as recently as 20 May 2010 Mr Yahalom agreed to a variation of the estimate of legal fees and costs of his previous solicitors, resulting in an estimate of $250,000 in relation to the proceeding, presumably on the basis that he could pay that sum in fees. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1065">Order 4 r 14(2) of the Federal Court Rules provides: 
 
 Except as provided by or under any Act, a corporation may not, without the leave of the Court, commence or carry on any proceeding otherwise than by a solicitor. 
 

 
Counsel for the parties referred me to the following authorities in relation to the approach to be taken on an application for leave under the rule: Tobacco Control Coalition Inc v Philip Morris (Australia) Ltd [2000] FCA 131 ( Tobacco Control ); Checked-Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1002 ( Checked-Out ); Silkearl Pty Ltd v Ainsworth Game Technology Ltd [2006] FCA 949 ( Silkearl ) and Cytel Pty Ltd v Peoplebank Recruitment Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 985 ( Cytel ). I will return to these authorities below. </sentence>
