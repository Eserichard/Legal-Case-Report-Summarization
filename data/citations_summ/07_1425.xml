<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 187">17 At [50]-[53], his Honour then discussed whether the misinformation on the ballot paper was such as to deprive the employees of the required reasonable opportunity. His Honour referred to the judgment of Graham J in Shop Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1425 (2007) 166 IR 51 at [49] , affirmed by the Full Court on appeal in Shop Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 42 (2008) 166 FCR 562 , in which it was held that, if the minds of the relevant employees were or were likely to be contaminated by misinformation about the agreement and its effect, it could be said that such employees were denied a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they wanted to approve the agreement. In the present case, the primary judge found that the ballot paper erroneously stated that the proposed agreement was to operate for the period 2009-2011. This was plainly false, because cl 7 of the agreement provided that it was to operate for a period of four years. His Honour found that this false information was likely to have affected the employees in their decision whether to approve the proposed agreement. His Honour said that the actual term of the agreement was twice the period represented on the ballot paper. The difference was not trivial or insignificant. The false information was provided against a background of uncertain economic conditions and an expectation that those conditions may change for the better in the next few years, an expectation that Mr McInnes had expressed to some of the employees at a meeting. 103 Undoubtedly, a judgment as to whether or not 'a reasonable opportunity to decide' has been given will require consideration of the likely effect that misinformation given by an employer may have had upon an employee's decision to vote one way or another, in the absence of any evidence as to the actual effect of such misinformation on the minds of any of the appellant's employees. A trivial misstatement in a document put around by an employer could hardly amount to a failure by the employer to give all of the persons employed at the time whose employment would be subject to the proposed employee collective agreement a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they wanted to approve the agreement or not. Lack of any evidence whatsoever from employees who approved the agreement, expressing dissatisfaction with the outcome that was secured as a result of a majority of those persons casting valid votes deciding that they wanted to approve the agreement, would be a matter that may properly be taken into account in deciding the significance of any misstatement. If the minds of the relevant employees were or were likely to be contaminated by misinformation about the proposed agreement and its effect then it could be said that such employees were denied a 'reasonable opportunity to decide' whether they wanted to approve it. The ultimate consequence that may flow from a failure by an employer to give 'a reasonable opportunity to decide' is an irrelevant consideration. Whether an employer has or has not given all of the persons employed at the time whose employment would be subject to the agreement a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they wanted to approve the agreement or not should be capable of being determined immediately prior to the decision being taken. (see per Graham J in Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1425 ; (2007) 166 IR 51 at [49] - [51] and [54]-[55]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 173">23 In his reasons for judgment Carr J said at [131]:
 '... As the High Court of Australia explained in Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 420 --- 421 an award imposes certain statutory terms and conditions which do not necessarily displace underlying common law contractual relations. If they conflict, the award or certified agreement may modify the contractual provisions, but otherwise they continue to co-exist. Byrne involved an award, but there does not seem to be any relevant distinction, for present purposes, between an award and a certified agreement. ...' 

 
(See per Graham J in Shop Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1425 ; (2007) 166 IR 51 at [24] - [25] and [29]-[35]. )</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 750">Of these provisions, s 338 is not relevant in these proceedings: see [13] above. As to s 337, in Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd (No 2) (' Karellas ')(2007) 166 IR 51 ; [2007] FCA 1425 , Graham J observed that s 340(2)(a) of the WR Act could not be simply concerned with timeliness, nor access to the relevant employee collective agreement, because those matters were covered by s 337: see at [49]-[50]. I respectfully agree with his Honour's observations in this regard. Section 340(2)(a) must therefore serve some other purpose, apart from timeliness or ensuring access to the proposed agreement. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 608">Mr Green's statement contained at paragraph seven of his affidavit, reproduced at [19] above, is the only evidence that any employee might have been misled, assuming the statements to be wrong. The Court is mindful of the finding of Graham J at [49] in Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCA 1425 ; (2007) 166 IR 51 (' Karellas No. 1 ') where his Honour said: 
 In the absence of any evidence whatsoever as to the effect of any of the matters or alleged misinformation on the minds of any of the Karellas' employees, the likely effect of such alleged misinformation has to be considered. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 437">The applicant placed considerable reliance upon my judgment, at first instance, in Shop Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCA 1425 , which was affirmed on appeal by Moore, Marshall and Tracey JJ in Shop Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 42 ; (2008) 166 FCR 562 ('Karellas'). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 604">In addition to the above four grounds for finding contravention of s.341 , the TWU argued that the employees had been denied "a reasonable opportunity to decide" at the 9 March 2007 meeting, because of the making of two misrepresentations by Mr Schloeffel which also form the basis of the alleged contravention of s.401 which I shall address below. It relied upon Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd (No.2) [2007] FCA 1425 ; (2007) 166 IR 51 at [43] - [55], where Graham J held that a breach of s.340(2)(a) could arise by misinformation about the effect of a proposed collective agreement being given to employees, which was likely to "contaminate" their minds when considering whether they wanted to approve it. His Honour's reasoning was accepted on appeal. In the Full Court's judgment, the court said at [2008] FCAFC 42 [54]: An employee who is given false and misleading information that may affect his or her decision on whether to approve an agreement is, by the very provision of that information, denied a reasonable opportunity to decide whether to approve the agreement. That is, because there is information available to the employee which has the capacity to distract him or her on voting on the agreement and from considering its actual effect. A decision that is capable of being affected by false and misleading information is not a decision about approving the agreement, but a decision about extraneous matters not given effect to by the agreement. </sentence>
