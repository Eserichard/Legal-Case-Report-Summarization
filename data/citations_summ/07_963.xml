 There is no doubt that at least some investment advisors will owe fiduciary duties. However, it is an error to think that merely because one can put the tag "investment advisor" on a defendant that he or she will be a fiduciary: Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd [2001] HCA 31 ; 207 CLR 165 , 197.

That is correct. In re HIH Insurance Ltd (in prov liq. ); Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler , for example, Mr Adler's participation in making investment decisions as a member of the investment committee sufficed, although the committee was subject to the direction and control of the board (see at [73]). The reasoning of Santow J was accepted by Jacobson J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 963.  It was submitted that to be concerned in the management of a company is a much wider concept than making, or participating in the making, of a far-reaching decision. I doubt this is so.

Accordingly, there was no justification for Mr Simpson owed fiduciary duties as an investment advisor. Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd [2001] HCA 31 ; 207 CLR 165 , applied; Daly v Sydney Stock Exchange [1986] HCA 25 ; 160 CLR 371 , distinguished; ASIC v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Limited (No 4) [2007] FCA 963 ; 160 FCR 35 ; Pavan v Ratnam (1996) 23 ACSR 214 ; Townsend v Roussety &amp; Co (WA) Pty Ltd [2007] WASCA 40 ; 33 WAR 321 , referred to. (2) As to whether Mr Simpson's alleged breach caused the loss: obiter, the onus was on the Slaters, not the alleged fiduciary, to prove that had there been full disclosure they would not have entered into the transaction. There were sufficient surrounding facts and circumstances to permit the primary judge to draw an inference that the respondents loss' had been caused by the breaches as he had determined existed.

126 It appears that the definition of "officer" in para (b)(i) and (ii) inserted by the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999 was intended to codify the decision of Ormiston J in Commissioner for Corporate Affairs v Bracht (see The Treasury, CLERP ( Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill Commentary on the Draft Provisions --- Corporate Law Economic Reform Program No. 9 (October 2003), Chapter 9 at [69] and [70]; Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, Personal Liability for Corporate Fault Discussion Paper (May 2005) at 74). Section 179(2) in Pt 2D.1 dealing with the duties and powers of officers and employees provided that the definition of "officer" in s 9 included, as well as directors and secretaries, some other people who manage the corporation or its property. When read in the context of the provisions imposing duties on an "officer" of a corporation, and read in the light of the legislative history and the apparent intention of the Parliamentary draftsman to codify what was formerly a definition of an "executive officer", it can be seen that para (b)(ii) should be taken as referring to a person who, in his or her management of the affairs of the corporation, has the capacity to affect significantly the corporation's financial standing. It does not refer to a person who has that capacity as a third party but is not involved in the management of the corporation's affairs. As Jacobson J said in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd (No. 4) [2007] FCA 963 ; (2007) 160 FCR 35 at [490] :

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] NSWSC 719">219 It is not correct to say that the relationship between an accountant and his or her client is not usually a fiduciary one. It depends upon the work the accountant is retained to do, and the scope of any fiduciary duty might be limited. The relationship of solicitor and client has long been held to be a fiduciary relationship and was so regarded when solicitors undertook a wider scope of work than they do now. (From the 19 th century, solicitors' work was increasingly encroached on or taken over by financial advisers, patent agents, brokers and accountants: Abel-Smith &amp; Stevens, Lawyers and The Courts --- A Sociological Study of the English Legal System 1750-1965 , (1967) at 58). There is no presumption that the relationship between a financial adviser and his client is not a fiduciary one. To the contrary, such a relationship is likely to involve elements of trust, confidence and vulnerability requiring undivided loyalty ( Tate v Williamson (1866) LR2ChApp 55; Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc [1999] FCA 1798 at [817] ; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 963 ; (2007) 160 FCR 35 at [282] - [286]). Moreover, in the present case, Mr Sweeney was not only a financial adviser. Although not successful in raising capital, he undertook the role of a broker seeking to negotiate the raising of capital for commission. There is little to distinguish his position from that of a stockbroker engaged to buy or sell shares on behalf of his client, who owes fiduciary duties to the client in buying and selling ( Daly v Sydney Stock Exchange Ltd [1986] HCA 25 ; (1986) 160 CLR 371 at 384). </sentence>

 B.4 When is a pecuniary loss "due to" a failure to carry on business under the licence adequately and properly?

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] NSWSC 287">It was submitted that the current definition is vastly different from the definitions considered in Bracht and Vines . It was submitted that to be concerned in the management of a company is a much wider concept than making, or participating in the making, of a far-reaching decision. I doubt this is so. As Jacobson J said in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Limited [2007] FCA 963 at [490] :

  Whether information is " readily observable matter " is a question of fact to be determined objectively and hypothetically ( R v Firns [2001] NSWCCA 191 ; (2001) 51 NSWLR 548 at [83] , Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 963 ; (2007) 160 FCR 35 at [546] .

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCA 52">Mr Mitchell was called by Mr Cahill to give evidence, but he gave no evidence that he had received a call from Mr Mates or any other Union representative that day or on any subsequent day. Indeed, Mr Mitchell was not asked whether Mr Mates or anyone else from the Union had telephoned him at Independent Cranes on 21 February 2006 or any other date. As counsel for the Union and Mr Mates said, it has to be borne in mind that, at this time, Mr Mitchell was in charge of bookings at Independent Cranes. If there had been a warning off as alleged, he might reasonably have been expected to know about it. Counsel for the Union and Mr Mates relied on the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298. Counsel argued that the inference that there was no warning off might, in the absence of testimony from Mr Mitchell, be more comfortably drawn. I accept this submission in part: see Braverus Maritime Inc v Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd [2005] FCAFC 256 ; (2005) 148 FCR 68 at 112 [159] - [160] and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 963 ; (2007) 241 ALR 705 at 758 [384] per Jacobson J. I accept that, in the absence of any testimony from Mr Mitchell on the subject, it may be more comfortably inferred that, leaving aside what had happened earlier on 21 February 2006, no-one from the Union directly or expressly warned off Independent Cranes. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FCA 1986">70 A more generally expressed submission advanced by the Trustee that it was a part of the fiduciary duty owed by a director to make full disclosure is rejected. " The strong weight of judicial authority is that fiduciary duties are proscriptive rather than prescriptive; accordingly, a fiduciary does not have a positive duty to disclose information ": Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 963 at [375] , [2007] FCA 963 ; 160 FCR 35 at 88 per Jacobson J. Reference may also be made to one of the authorities there referred to by His Honour, namely Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 , 186 CLR 71. Gaudron and McHugh JJ there observed (at 113):
 In this country, fiduciary obligations arise because a person has come under an obligation to act in another's interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] NSWSC 1225">
