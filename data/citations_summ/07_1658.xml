<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 35">30 The applicant is a bankrupt, pursuant to orders of the Federal Magistrates Court of 22 May 2007: see Kidney v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCMA 943. An application to set aside the bankruptcy notice had earlier been dismissed by the Federal Magistrates Court: see Fitzpatrick v Kidney [2007] FMCA 942. An appeal from those orders, and certain related orders, was dismissed by a judge of this Court (Madgwick J) on 19 September 2007: see Fitzpatrick v Keelty [2007] FCA 1658. His Honour did not "order a stay or injunction or do anything else of the kind that would prevent the ordinary operation of s 60 of the [Bankruptcy] Act" (see [38] of his Honour's reasons). Other orders had also been made by the Federal Magistrates Court on 3 August 2007 in the context of an application for annulment, which were somewhat unusual: see Fitzpatrick v Kidney [2007] FMCA 1422. The effect of the orders was to make an order for annulment, but to stay the operation of that order for 28 days and subject the annulment to the fulfilment of certain conditions. There has been no suggestion that the conditions the subject of the orders of 3 August 2007 have been satisfied. </sentence>
