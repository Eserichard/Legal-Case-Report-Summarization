<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 546">2 The issues framed by the Statement of Claim prior to amendment are described comprehensively in Duus v Dalvella Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1921 ( 'Duus v Dalvella' ). That decision determined, largely unfavourably to Dalvella and Donemate, their challenge to the adequacy of particulars given by the Trustees of the Statement of Claim. Some of the arguments dealt with in that decision have been raised again in the present application although on this occasion in the context of whether the Amended Statement of Claim properly pleads a cause of action reliant upon the integers of s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act'). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 26">18 The paragraph of the primary judgment which dealt with the issue of future creditors and facts giving rise to relevant inferences was [29] of Duus v Dalvella Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1921 which is in these terms:
 
 
 29. As to para 1(c) of the Request which seeks particulars of each and every one of the creditors the applicants contend Waters intended to defraud, the applicants say the reference to 'creditors' in para 22.1 is a reference to 'all of [Waters] then present creditors and all future creditors ... including Jefferson and Stevenson and BSA'. The applicants say these particulars are sufficient and adequate as the response identifies all the then present creditors and, by class, all of the future creditors with a specific reference to two identified future creditors.</sentence>
