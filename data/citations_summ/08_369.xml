<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 849">The Group B members, it is said, raise existing claims of unconscionable conduct on the part of Allphones in threatening all franchisees that if they do not agree to execute Allphones' new franchise agreements, Allphones would require them to do so when they sought to renew their franchise agreements. Further, it is argued that the Group B members' claim is not hypothetical because they could have no confidence that Allphones would act in accordance with the Court's decision in the proceeding if they do not remain members of the represented class. It is argued that Allphones apparently seeks to re-litigate or at least not act consistently with all of the matters determined against it in Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 369 ; (2008) 167 FCR 314 in the current proceedings. See also Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 ; (2009) 253 ALR 324 , particularly at [121]-[122], [134] and [143]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 407">Thus, an assertion in a statement of claim in an action for damages for personal injuries that a plaintiff, X, was the driver of a motor car when it collided with another vehicle at a particular time and place will generally constitute an admission within the meaning of s 81(1) so as to be admissible against X in subsequent civil or criminal proceedings. That I consider to be consistent with the observations of Cockburn CJ in Richards v Morgan [1863] EngR 997 ; (1863) 4 B &amp; S 641. In a passage, at 661, which has been cited with approval by Rares J in Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 369 ; (2008) 167 FCR 314 , at [34], his Lordship said; 
 'It cannot be doubted that a man's assertions are admissions, whether made in the course of a judicial proceeding or otherwise, and, in the former case, whether he was himself a party to such proceeding or not. It may be given in evidence against him in any suit or action in which the fact so asserted or admitted becomes material to the issue to be determined. And in principle, there can be no difference whether the assertion or admission be made by the party himself who is sought to be affected by it, or by someone employed, directed or invited by him to make the particular statement on his behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] NSWSC 1322">127 It does not seem to me that the matters relied upon by LawCover as admissions by the Plaintiffs take the matter very far. For present purposes, I accept that statements made by the Plaintiffs' then solicitors are capable of being admissions by the Plaintiffs: Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 369 ; (2008) 167 FCR 314 at 318-319 [18] . The fact that the Plaintiffs have no real knowledge whether Mr Flammia acted dishonestly or fraudulently with respect to their claim does not mean that any purported admissions by them to that effect cannot be received into evidence: Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd at 323-324 [37]-[39]. However, it may be that little weight will be given to such an admission. Its probative force must be determined by reference to the circumstances in which it is made and may depend all together upon the party's source of knowledge: Lustre Hosiery Ltd v York [1935] HCA 71 ; (1935) 54 CLR 134 at 143-144; Grey v Australian Motorists and General Insurance Co Pty Ltd (1976) 1 NSWLR 669 at 684-685. At a final hearing, the trial judge may not be satisfied that this evidence ought be treated as admissions. Once again, for the purpose of this application, I will treat this as evidence of admissions and assess what weight ought be given to it. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 810">In April and June 2007, Bernard Lloyd, then an employed solicitor of Bartier Perry, swore affidavits in which he identified Allphones' discovered documents for which it had made a claim to legal professional privilege, which were read before Tamberlin J, who upheld the claim. Mr Lloyd also identified the facts supporting each claim for privilege. Hoy Mobile tendered Mr Lloyd's affidavits as admissions by Allphones of its state of knowledge during the period leading up to it giving notice of its intention to terminate on 28 August 2006 (see Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 369). Mr Lloyd's affidavits revealed that by 14 June 2006, Tony Baker, another director of Allphones, and Tony Mitchell, the chairman of Allphones, were involved in email exchanges relating to the dispute with Hoy Mobile. </sentence>
