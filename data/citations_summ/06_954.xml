<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 394">That section invests the Court with jurisdiction in a federal matter, even if it has not otherwise been given that jurisdiction, as long as that matter is associated with another federal matter over which the Court does have jurisdiction: Philip Morris v Brown per Mason J at 516. In Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship "Global Peace" [2006] FCA 954 ; (2006) 232 ALR 694 Allsop J described associated jurisdiction in the following terms: Provisions such as ... s 32 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) dealing with associated jurisdiction confer (or invest) jurisdiction in a matter which, by reference to ss.75 and 76 of the Constitution , could be (but has not been) conferred (or invested), if it is "associated" with a matter in respect of which jurisdiction has been conferred (or invested) and which has been invoked. (at 709 [60]) 
The only jurisdiction which may be conferred by association is federal jurisdiction, being that jurisdiction referred to in ss.75 and 76 of the Constitution : Phillips Morris v Brown ; PCS Operations Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (1998) 153 ALR 520 ; Macteldir Pty Ltd v Dimovski [2005] FCA 1528 ; (2005) 226 ALR 773. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1518">21 Jurisdiction is conferred upon the Court in respect of proceedings commenced (as this one was) as actions in personam on a maritime claim: s 9(1)(a) of the Act. As to the maritime jurisdiction conferred on the Court by the Act, see Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship 'Global Peace' [2006] FCA 954 ; (2006) 154 FCR 439 at 451-460 [53] - [76]. The fact that the events took place in the United Kingdom does not affect the question of jurisdiction. The Act confers jurisdiction irrespective of the place where events took place: s 5 of the Act, " all maritime claims, wherever arising" ; see this respect The 'Global Peace' 154 FCR at 454 [58].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1112">Clearly enough, s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth). It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words: Owners of "Shin Kobe Maru" v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 54 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 at 421; see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia [2006] HCA 38 at [7] - [10] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Crennan JJ. Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked, the Court should exercise it ( Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally ; [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511 at 588 [149] ), even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse: cf: Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority [2006] HCA 27 [3]-[15] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ: see too: Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship 'Global Peace' [2006] FCA 954 at [138] per Allsop J, see too at [62]-[76]. Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) by s 31. But s 31(1) provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person (defined by s 3(1) as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person) who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property.</sentence>
