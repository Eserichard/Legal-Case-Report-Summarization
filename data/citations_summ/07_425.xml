The Union was vicariously liable for the conduct of its delegate, Mr Fry. The conduct involved Mr Fry falsely telling a self-employed building contractor engaged to do work on a building site that he was required to join the CFMEU (the s 298SC breach) and falsely telling the contractor that he was required to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement (the s 170NC breach). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWIRComm 126">20 Mr Saunders submitted that the principle that Union delegateship is not a 'magic cloak' to absolve an individual of his/her accountability for their own conduct has also been applied in Hyde v Chrysler (Australia) Ltd [1977] FCA 20 ; (1977) 30 FLR 318 at 332; Lewis v Qantas Airways Ltd [1981] FCA 137 ; (1981) 54 FLR 101 at 113 - 114; Australian Workers' Union v BlueScope Steel Limited [2006] NSWIRComm 1092 at [37] - [41]; Hadgkiss v CFMEU (No. 4) [2007] FCA 425 ; Leadbetter v Qantas Airways Limited [2009] AIRC 131 at [118] - [120]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 17">This appeal represents the culmination, in this Court, of a series of proceedings arising from events which occurred in the Illawarra region of New South Wales in January and February 2004. The judgments which are most directly relevant to an understanding of those events and the litigation which ensued are: Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) [2007] FCA 87 (the "principal judgment" where the trial judge concluded that the present appellants each contravened s 298SC(c) of the WR Act), Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 4) [2007] FCA 425 (the "relief judgment" where the primary judge made each of the orders which remain for consideration in the present appeal, as well as other orders), Hadgkiss v CFMEU [2008] FCAFC 22 (where a Full Court allowed an appeal by the present respondent in part and remitted some matters for further consideration by the primary judge) and Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 5) [2008] FCA 1040 (where the primary judge considered the matters remitted to him and imposed some further penalties but not ones which require consideration in the present appeal). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1040"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 749">In Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No. 4) [2007] FCA 425 at [102] Graham J noted that section 347 did not allow separate determinations to be made in respect of costs by reference to different statutory claims. His Honour noted to secure an order for costs the respondent in that case had to demonstrate the whole of the proceeding had been instituted vexatiously.  In Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No. 4) [2007] FCA 425 at [101] to [102] Graham J having considered the decision in Seven Network said: "101. It is clear in the present case that the proceeding which was instituted by the applicant was in a 'matter arising under' the Act. Whatever other 'matters' may be inherent in the one legal controversy, the present case involved a proceeding in respect of a controversy which arose under the Act, whether the claims for relief be expressed as being made under s 170NC, s 298S(2)(a) or s 298SC(c). 102. Section 347(1) does not allow for separate determinations to be made in respect of costs by reference to different statutory claims arising from the one legal controversy. For the respondents to succeed in securing an order for costs they must demonstrate that the whole of the proceeding was instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause. They cannot secure an order for costs referrable to the success or failure of individual claims within the one proceeding in the one matter arising under the Act.

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Introduction 
 On 16 May 2008 the Court made orders, for the reasons set out in Bognar v Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (No.1) [2008] FMCA 571 , dismissing the applicant's amended application filed 29 January 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 466">9 The relevance of that question is emphasised by noting the facts found in relation to his activities in relation to another site in the Wollongong area not long after these events ( Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) [2007] FCA 87 , (2007) 160 IR 263 ; Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 4) [2007] FCA 425 , (2007) 161 IR 338 ; Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCAFC 22). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCAFC 22">51 This appeal is one of two against a judgment of a judge of this Court in Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) [2007] FCA 87. In that judgment the primary judge found that each respondent had contravened the provisions of s 298SC(c) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the Act') as in force in January and February 2004. The present appeal is by the applicant at first instance who was an inspector appointed under s 84 of the Act to whom the Employment Advocate (referred to in Part IVA of the Act) had delegated certain powers and functions including the power to make the application. The other appeal was brought by the respondents at first instance (now the respondents to the present appeal) who appealed against certain findings in the judgment and also against penalties imposed and other orders later made by the primary judge ( Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 4) [2007] FCA 425). Because the present appeal raised the possibility that, if the appellant succeeds on some of its arguments, it may be necessary to remit issues to the primary judge for further attention and as that might possibly affect the penalties imposed, the second appeal was adjourned pending the outcome of the present appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1001">13 The applicant informed me, in unchallenged written submissions on the question of penalty, that the CFMEU has a prior record of breach of provisions in Part XA of the Act. They are as follows:
 
 * CFMEU v Hamberger [2003] FCAFC 38 ; (2003) 127 FCR 309 - penalty of $3,000;
 * Hadgkiss v Blevin [2004] FCA 917 - penalty of $5,500;
 * Hadgkiss v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 524 - penalty of $6,000;
 * Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 4) [2007] FCA 425 --- penalties totalling $10,000 ($5,000, $2,500 and $2,500). </sentence>
