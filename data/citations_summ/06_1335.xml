<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1400">10 Further, in the case of Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1335 , Lander J gave leave to the applicants to amend their statement of claim after he had delivered reasons for judgment but before the judgment was entered. Lander J said that one of the reasons why he had not entered orders was that he thought it would be appropriate to allow the second applicant and third applicant to consider his reasons in case they wished to make any application to amend their pleadings. It appears that the statement of claim relied upon at the trial needed to be amended in order to accommodate the expert evidence which had been led at trial. Lander J allowed the amendment on the basis that the respondents had always been on notice of the applicants' claim for loss and damage in the manner contemplated by the proposed amendment, that the trial had been conducted on that basis and that justice required that he allow the proposed amendment.</sentence>
