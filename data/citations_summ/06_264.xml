<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1311">In Business in Focus (Aust) Pty Ltd v Begun Property Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 264 , Collier J, on an application made several weeks before the date fixed for trial, vacated a trial date due to the applicants' change of solicitor. The new solicitor deposed to a large volume of material to review. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1598">18 In addition to this authority, relevant decisions in relation to this application include the following :
 
1. In Jarrett v Westpac Banking Corporation [1999] FCA 425 , the Full Court held that the withdrawal of, or change of, legal representation shortly before a hearing will not necessarily or routinely give rise to a situation where the Court should permit the trial dates to be vacated (particularly Mansfield J at [87]). In that case, however, the Court allowed an appeal from a single judge refusing an adjournment, in circumstances where the respondents would have had no legal representation at the trial if the trial had proceeded
 
2. in Robinson v Aware Industries Ltd (unreported Weinberg J, 1 October 1998) Weinberg J noted that it was common ground between the parties in that case that, given the fact that the new solicitors and counsel for the applicant had only just been retained, it would be inappropriate and unfair to the applicant, as well as the respondents, to require the trial to proceed. His Honour ordered that the existing trial dates be vacated and a new trial date be fixed. However his Honour also ordered that, in the circumstances, the applicant pay the costs thrown away by reason of the need to vacate the trial date, on an indemnity basis
 
3. in Business in Focus (Aust) Pty Ltd v Begun Property Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 264 , in view of the prejudice the respondents would have suffered in this case if the trial had proceeded because of engagement of new solicitors shortly before the trial after a period of inactivity by their previous legal advisors, I ordered that the trial dates be vacated and any costs thrown away by the respondents as a result of the vacation of the trial date be borne by the applicants
 
4. in Menzies v CRCI Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 118 , where the application for vacation of the trial was made on the first day of the trial, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales held that: 
 
 "where an amendment would require vacation of a trial hearing date which was set to take place within a few days, generally there is prejudice through prolongation of the litigation that is not entirely met by costs, and the imposition of that prejudice on the other party needs to be justified by the strength of the case made for the indulgence by the party applying for it. " (at [27])
