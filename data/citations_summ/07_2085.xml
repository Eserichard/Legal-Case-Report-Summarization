<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 197"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 970">In Re King &amp; I Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2085 , McKerracher J amplified to the above, observing that: 
 
 
 [5] It is necessary to take into account the broad interests of both present and future prospective creditors, contributories and the 'public interest including matters of commercial morality' (see Mercy &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Wanari Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 756 ; (2000) 157 FLR 107 ; Re Nardell Coal Corp Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 281 ; (2004) 182 FLR 290 and Re Data Homes Pty Ltd [1972] 2 NSWLR 22). [6] As to more specific matters, as future creditors are concerned, an important consideration arises if the proposal for termination of the winding up preserves existing debt. If that is so, it is necessary to ascertain what arrangements exist and whether those arrangements are binding for the subordination of claimants of such debt to newly incurred debts and/or whether there is any proposal to capitalise debts: see Re Data Homes [1972] 2 NSWLR 22 at 27 and Re Nardell [2004] NSWSC 281 ; 182 FLR 290 at 78. In this application, there are two possible debts requiring consideration of this nature. 
 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1144">As did McKerracher J in The King &amp; I Pty Ltd, in the matter of The King &amp; I Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2085 , I accept as relevant factors those factors identified by these authorities and others as follows: 
(1) The granting of a stay is a discretionary matter, and there is a clear onus on the applicant to make out a positive case for a stay. (2) There must be service of notice of the application for a stay on all creditors and contributories, and proof of this. (3) The nature and extent of the creditors must be shown, and whether or not all debts have been or will be discharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] VSCA 179">The same applies to a company which is technically solvent but likely to become insolvent. [20] 

 The importance of an applicant demonstrating the solvency of a company, and of the Court having regard to the public interest --- and to the interrelated issue of commercial morality --- has often been emphasised. In recent times, Hammerschlag J said this in Gematech Pty Ltd v Bardi Investments Pty Ltd : [21] 
 
 [24] The approach to be taken by the Court to applications such as the present, and the factors to which the Court may and should have regard, have been the subject of consideration in the authorities: see Re Telescriptor Syndicate Ltd [1903] 2 Ch 174 ; Re Mascot Home Furnishers Pty Ltd [1970] VicRp 78 ; [1970] VR 593 ; Re Data Homes Pty Ltd [1972] 2 NSWLR 22 ; Re Warbler Pty Ltd (1982) 6 ACLR 526 ; Dubolo Pty Ltd v Codrington Investment Corporation Pty (1998) 26 ACSR 723 ; Re Intag International Ltd (in Liq); Westpac Banking Corp v Intag International Ltd [1999] NSWSC 645 ; Mercy &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Wanari Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 756 ; (2000) 35 ACSR 70 ; Anderson v Palmer [2002] NSWSC 192 ; Re Nardell Coal Corporation Pty Ltd (2004) 49 ACSR 110 ; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Biosolids Management Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 272 ; Metledge v Bambakit Pty Ltd (in liq) [2005] NSWSC 160 ; McConnochie v Lopez [2006] WASC 206 ; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Giumar Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 101 ; Re The King &amp; I Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2085. [25] Relevantly, for present purposes, two things are clear. [26] Firstly, the solvency of the Company is to be demonstrated by the applicants who bear the onus to do so by leading the 'fullest and best' evidence of the company's financial position: Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Begonia (1993) 11 ACSR 609 .</sentence>
