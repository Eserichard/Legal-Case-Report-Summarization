[9]</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 65">13 On 13 February 2006 Merkel J published reasons for judgment on three issues which his Honour identified as outstanding, but deferred consideration of issues of extinguishment (see Rubibi Community v Western Australia (No 6) [2006] FCA 82 ; (2006) 226 ALR 676 (" Rubibi (No 6) "). The issues determined by his Honour in Rubibi (No 6) were identified by him at [11] as follows:
 
 
 (a) the identification of the native title determination area;
 (b) the criteria for membership of the native title holding community; and
 (c) the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests possessed by the native title holding community. </sentence>

I also concluded that, generally, the evidence supports an inference that the native title rights and interests include a right of exclusive possession and occupation of the Yawuru claim area (excluding the inter-tidal zone) where there has been no extinguishment of that right.</sentence>
