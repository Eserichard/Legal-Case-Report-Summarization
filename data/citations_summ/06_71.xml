<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 402">I do not accept, particularly in the Tribunal which is not bound by rules of evidence, that evidence of subjective purpose should not be allowed. While it is clear that ultimately an objective conclusion must be reached, it does not follow, particularly in a case in which there are objective factors which could support conclusions both for an against 'carrying on an enterprise', that the evidence of subjective purpose cannot be considered. By comparison (but in the context of income tax), in Ell v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 71 Emmett J said: Although not determinative, intention is relevant where, for example, a particular activity produces no income (see John v FCT [1989] HCA 5 ; (1989) 166 CLR 417) or where the first step in a business is undertaken (see Fairwell States Pty Ltd v FCT [1970] HCA 29 ; (1970) 123 CLR 153). It is necessary to examine the activities engaged in, including their nature and extent (see Martin v FCT [1953] HCA 100 ; (1953) 90 CLR 470 at 474). Activities may constitute the carrying on of a business even though the activities are carried on in a small way and it is not for the Commissioner to dictate to a taxpayer in which business the taxpayer engages or how to run a business profitably or economically (see Tweedle v FCT [1942] HCA 40 ; (1952) 180 CLR 1).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] AATA 393">He also submitted that the vessel was moored at Docklands to expose it to a greater number of people than elsewhere --- but its effect must have been to isolate the applicant from it. That is, he was located in Geelong, 70kms away, mussel farming six days per week. Even if his business was to demonstrate, sail it and refer people to Vicsail, he could not readily or practically do it. The business, as he described, involved a principal (him) who was mainly absent. He did entrust Vicsail to sell Dufour yachts but their role must not be confused with his role. I am not satisfied that the activities of the applicant concerning the yacht permit a finding of any business . His commitment to mussel farming caused him to be mainly absent from marketing and promoting the vessel. The absence of any or any adequate or reasonable planning, control, revenue projection or expectation point to the applicant not being engaged in activities done in the form of a business (concerning the yacht) (refer s 9-20 of the Act and Fergusen v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1979] FCA 29 ; (1979) 26 ALR 307 ; Ell and Anor v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 71) ( Ell ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1651">85 After the hearing of the present application, I was referred by the solicitor for the Commissioner with notice to the solicitors for Hostess Marine to Ell v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 71 (10 February 2006). That case concerned a claim by two taxpayers to deduct for income tax purposes leasing expenses, interest, depreciation and the cost of repairs in relation to two yachts from each of which they claimed respectively to have derived income. Emmett J upheld the Commissioner's disallowance of the claimed deductions on the ground that, in the relevant years, the yachts had not been used mainly for letting on hire in the ordinary course of a business carried on by the taxpayers. His Honour found on the facts that neither taxpayer had the intention of using the yachts to gain or produce assessable income or in the course of carrying on a business. In the present case, the critical intention was to use the "Hostess" mainly for purposes other than the provision of the facilities enumerated in pars (a), (b) and (c) of Item 59(1). By contrast with Ell v Commissioner of Taxation, that intention was not negatived by the facts which I have found. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] AATA 661">Subsection 26-50(5)(b) is relevant to the present circumstances as it is the use of the yachts by Mr Athineos most closely resembling those set out as options above. The subsection requires Mr Athineos to show "use" of the boat, or that the boat is held, for letting on hire in the ordinary course of a business. Further, the "letting on hire" must occur in the ordinary course of a business which is carried on by the taxpayer (emphasis added): Ell v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 71 at 154 --- 155. Mr Athineos did not let his boat on hire personally but contracted this task to another. The further aspect of his activities is whether it was a business.  In Ell v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 71 Emmett J stated: 
 
 "111 Although not determinative, intention is relevant where, for example, a particular activity produces no income (see John v FCT (1989) 166 CLR 417) or where the first step in a business is undertaken (see Fairway Estates Pty Ltd v FCT (1970) 123 CLR 153. It is necessary to examine the activities engaged in, including their nature and extent (see Martin v FCT (1953) 90 CLR 470 at 474). Activities may constitute the carrying on of a business even though the activities are carried on in a small way and it is not for the Commissioner to dictate to a taxpayer in which business the taxpayer engages or how to run a business profitably or economically (see Tweddle v FCT (1952) 180 CLR 1). Whether a taxpayer relies on the first limb or the second limb of s8-1, he or she must also satisfy the requirements of s26-50. Likewise, the claim for depreciation must satisfy s26-50. If Mr Athineos was not carrying on a business in the years covered by the reviewable objection decision, the objection decision must be upheld. In Ell v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 71 , a case concerning deductions claimed in respect of two boats and similarly raising s26-50, Emmett J approached the issues as follows (at [103]): 
 
 "In the light of the Taxpayers' formulation of the issues and the grounds stated in their Notices of Objection, the Taxpayers must establish that their activities amounted to carrying on a business. The first question, therefore, is whether the Taxpayers were carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. If that question is whether the Taxpayers used Athena, or held it, at all times in the relevant income years: 
 
 mainly for letting it out on hire in the ordinary course of a business carried on by the Taxpayers; or mainly for transporting, for payment in the ordinary course of a business carried on by the Taxpayers, the public or goods; or for a purpose that was essential to the efficient conduct of a business carried on by them.
