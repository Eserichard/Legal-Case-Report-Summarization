<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 40">Sirtex, by motion, sought indemnity costs against UWA but without success: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 ; (2008) 249 ALR 360. This was a reasonable attempt by Sirtex to mitigate its loss and damage caused by Dr Gray's misleading and deceptive conduct. The costs order made by French J as between UWA and Sirtex did not resolve the question of the damages claimed by Sirtex against Dr Gray on the cross-claim. Viewed in this way no violence is done to the general principle found in Cockburn and other cases. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1494">The significance for costs purposes to be attributed to a rejected Calderbank offer falls, increasingly, for determination by reference to criteria of reasonableness: Was the offer a reasonable one in the circumstances? Was its rejection unreasonable when viewed in light of the circumstances existing at the time of its rejection? See eg University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 ; (2008) 249 ALR 360 at 361; Dal Pont at [13.58]. In making that determination, the circumstances of the litigation and the parties' understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their respective cases can be relevant considerations: see GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 ; (2003) 201 ALR 55 at [34] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1460">The notion that Bitech should pay Garth Living's costs on an indemnity basis is based upon Garth Living's contention that Bitech unreasonably rejected a settlement offer made by Garth Living. The relevant principles are to be found in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 233---234; Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 at 152---153 (per Black CJ) and at 156---158 (per Cooper and Merkel JJ); and in University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 ; (2008) 249 ALR 360 at [32] ---[33] (p 368). In order to justify an order for indemnity costs by reason of the rejection of a settlement offer, the claimant must show that the refusal to accept the offer was unreasonable in all the circumstances at the time when the offer was rejected. The settlement offer relied upon by Garth Living in the present case was made on 11 July 2008 in a letter from Garth Living's lawyers (Eales &amp; Mackenzie) to DLA Phillips Fox dated that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 803">This is not the occasion upon which to resolve the difference in approach with respect to Calderbank offers and O 23 offers if for no other reason than the point was not argued. It is sufficient for present purposes to do no more than state my tentative view. So far as an O 23 offer is concerned, I think it does give rise to a presumptive entitlement to indemnity costs: MGICA (1992) Pty Ltd at 240. So far as Calderbank offers are concerned, the weight of authority is to the effect that the key issue is to determine whether rejection of the offer was unreasonable in all the circumstances (see Pollard at [9]; Crump v Equine Nutrition Systems Pty Ltd trading as Horsepower (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 25 at [40] ; Gretton at [16]; Equity 8 Pty Limited at [33]), but not whether the rejection of the offer was "plainly unreasonable" ( University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 ; (2008) 249 ALR 360 at [36] ). If the matter were not covered by authority, I would hold there to be no difference between an O 23 offer and a Calderbank letter provided the Calderbank offer allows for a reasonable time for acceptance. Each serves precisely the same function, encouraging parties to compromise the dispute. There seems to be no principled reason for there to be a difference between them. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] WASCA 115">
 
26 More recently, in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 , Sackville J said that the policy reasons given in Black for avoiding the word 'plainly' were persuasive [62], and in University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 ; (2008) 249 ALR 360 , French J observed:
 
 On the question of the level of unreasonableness necessary to attract the discretion, I respectfully agree with the comment of Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (2007) 244 ALR 374 ; [2007] FCA 1489 at [62] questioning the utility of substituting a requirement that rejection be 'plainly unreasonable' for the requirement that it be 'unreasonable'. Given the evaluative character of the judgment involved the addition of the word 'plainly' which is itself evaluative, has no useful function [36]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 63">In my view, the rejection by Ms Varas of the two offers of compromise was not unreasonable. First, she was entitled to treat both offers as "rolled up" offers inclusive of costs which reduces the weight to be given to their refusal [9] . Secondly, the litigation was complex and (for this Court) drawn out and it took some time for the issues between the parties to be clearly delineated. The parties attempted to negotiate a settlement in good faith on the first day of the trial of this matter and a breach of confidence claim against the psychologist, Ms Nolan, was resolved. It was only then that the scope and the content of the litigation became completely clear. Further, while both parties were at times in default of procedural orders of this Court, the conduct of the proceedings by neither party was such as to either disentitle them to a costs order or call for an award of indemnity costs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1805">23 The authorities recognise that the making of an offer outside O 23 by a respondent, which is rejected by an applicant who turns out to be wholly unsuccessful, is a matter to be taken into account in determining the nature of the costs order to be made. In such a case, a respondent claiming indemnity costs must show that the rejection of the offer of compromise was imprudent or unreasonable: see Dukemaster [2003] FCAFC 1 at [7] ; University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 at [36] per French J; and Seven Network [2007] FCA 1489 ; 244 ALR 374 at [39] and [51]. Where a cross-claimant makes an offer, which is rejected by a cross-respondent, and the cross-claimant ultimately fails, the position is quite different since there is little, if any, basis for saying that the rejection of the offer of compromise was imprudent and unreasonable. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1628">10 In my view the appropriate disposition is that there be no order as to costs. I cannot say that rejection of the offer was unreasonable within the meaning of s 824. Nor was the application for the stay incompetent or unsupportable. There were good reasons for the stay application to be brought and I have touched on those in Harbour City Real Estate No 1 at [13] and [14]. While there would, in circumstances to which s 824(2) applies, be scope for an award of indemnity costs, the mere fact alone that an offer is made and rejected is not of itself generally regarded as being sufficient to justify an award of indemnity costs. Rather, the rejection of the offer must be unreasonable or imprudent: see Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 ; Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [59] - [62] , University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 at [36] and MGICA v Kenny (1996) 70 FCR 236. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 1526">16 The approach taken in Alpine Hardwoods (Aust) Pty Ltd v Hardys Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 224 ; (2002) 190 ALR 121 at [27] - [28], in following the Full Federal Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 was that is necessary to focus on the reasonableness of the conduct of the offeree in rejecting the offer. Insofar as the applicant relies upon a rejection of the offer of compromise, the applicant must demonstrate that the conduct of the respondent was imprudent or unreasonable. However, the cases have also stressed that there is no super added requirement that it show a higher standard of unreasonableness such as 'plainly unreasonable': see Black v Lipovac at [218], Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [59] - [62] and University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 at [36] . </sentence>
