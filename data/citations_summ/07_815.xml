<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 382">There are three footnotes to that conclusion. The first is that this case is not concerned with the granting of relief where a respondent had defaulted in appearances which are governed by Order 35A rule 3(2) of the Federal Court Rules : cf. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665 at 680-681 [54]-[59] per Kiefel J; Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV "Mawishi al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 ; (2007) 240 ALR 120 at 122-123 [10] - [15] per Mansfield J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 352">The Court has a wide discretionary power to make declarations under s 21 of the FCA. How does O 35A sit with this discretionary power? Order 35A imposes no restraints upon the relief sought. It is now established that refusals by the Courts in the past to make declarations in cases of default and deemed admissions were based on a practice, not a rule of law: Dataline at [52] --- [59]; Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV "Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 ; (2007) 240 ALR 120 at [15] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 340">Dataline (2006) 236 ALR 665 was followed by Mansfield J in Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v The Ship MV "Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 ; (2007) 240 ALR 120. His Honour noted the previous reluctance to base declarations on admissions, but nonetheless approved and adopted the reasons of Kiefel J in Dataline (2006) 236 ALR 665 and made declarations on the basis of deemed admissions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 759">There is a long held view that a declaration, being a judicial act, should only be made on evidence and not simply on admissions or deemed admissions: Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV Mawashi Al Gasseem (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 ; (2007) 240 ALR 120 at [10] - [11] per Mansfield J and the cases referred to therein, particularly the observations of Kiefel J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665. The statement of agreed facts supplied to the Court, is drafted in such a way to supply the Court with evidence of the contravening conduct. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 760">There is a long held view that a declaration, being a judicial act, should only be made on evidence and not simply on admissions or deemed admissions: Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV Mawashi Al Gasseem (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 ; (2007) 240 ALR 120 at [10] - [11] per Mansfield J and the cases referred to therein, particularly the observations of Kiefel J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665 at [52]-[59]. The Statement of Agreed Facts supplied to the Court, is drafted in such a way to supply the Court with evidence of the contravening conduct. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 987">The parties agreed that I should make the declarations, impose the penalty and award the compensation set out above. There is some tension in the authorities whether declarations can be made by consent or whether the Court needs first to be satisfied that their making is appropriate. I need not enter into that debate since I am, in fact, satisfied that the evidence justifies the making of the declarations. I would say, however, that a perception amongst the profession that settlements might not be given effect to is a state of affairs which may retard settlement rates. Viewed through that prism, some of the traditional anxieties about the making of such declarations may need to be revisited in light of modern conditions: cf. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.net.au Pty Ltd (ACN 075 400 529) (2007) 236 ALR 665 at 680-681 [54]-[59] per Kiefel J; Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV "Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No. 2) [2007] FCA 815 ; (2007) 240 ALR 120 at 122-123 [10] - [15] per Mansfield J. This is particularly so in small industrial matters such as the present where the resources of the parties do not, in practical terms, permit the kind of litigation that often accompanies hearings on agreed penalties in large civil penalty proceedings. Unlike such cases, proceedings of the present kind are frequently settled on the steps of the Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 605">This line of authority was helpfully the summarised comparatively recently by Reeves J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Grove &amp; Edgar Pty Limited [2008] FCA 1956 at [18] ---[21]: 
 When the Court is asked to make declarations of right by consent it is required to scrutinise the orders sought to satisfy itself that it has the power to make those orders and to ensure, after due consideration, that they are appropriate: see ACCC v Real Estate Institute Industry of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79 at [1] and [17], ACCC v Virgin Mobile Australia Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2002] FCA 1548 at [1] and BMW Australia Limited v ACCC (2004) FCAFC 167 , (2004) 207 ALR 452 , (2004) ATPR 42-012 ( 'BMW' ) at [35]. On this aspect it should be noted that there is a long held view that a declaration, being a judicial act, should only be made on evidence and not simply on admissions or deemed admissions: see Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV Mawashi Al Gasseem (No.2) (2007) FCA 815 at [10] per Mansfield J and the cases referred to therein, particularly the observations of Kiefel J in ACCC v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1427 , (2006) 236 ALR 665. 

 
 The strictures mentioned above mean, among other things, that the Court has to ensure that the declaration sought is directed to determining a legal controversy and not to answering abstract or hypothetical questions: see Ainsworth at 582. Further the Court is required to ensure that the party seeking the declaration has a real interest in seeking that relief: see Forster at 437 and Ainsworth at 582.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1987">24 In regulatory contexts comparable to the present, this Court has informed itself as to those facts necessary for the granting of declaratory relief by reference to agreed facts and indeed the consent of the parties: Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV 'Mawashi Al Gasseem' (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 at [10] ---[16] [2007] FCA 815 ; , 240 ALR 120 at 122---4; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1534 at [10] per Nicholson J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v EDirect Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 65 at [20] ---[30], ATPR 42---216; Secretary, Department of Health &amp; Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [74] ---[79]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30], [34], ATPR 41---801.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 1956"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1735">17 Following the judgment of Kiefel J, but before consideration of that matter on appeal, Order 35A rule 3 was further considered by Mansfield J in Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV "Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 ; (2007) 240 ALR 120. His Honour referred to the reasons for judgment of Keifel J in Dataline.net.au and observed that the rule conferred a power in the Court which was discretionary as to whether relief, as sought, should be granted. His Honour proceeded to make declaratory orders, as sought, founded upon what he referred to as 'deemed admissions' on the relevant Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1545">This could be overcome by a statement, preceding the declarations, that orders are made: "upon admissions which [the respondent in question] is taken to have made, consequent upon non-compliance with orders of the court". An appeal has been dismissed: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 , 244 ALR 300. Her Honour's views as to the ability of the Court to grant declaratory relief upon the basis of deemed admissions has since been followed and applied by Mansfield J in Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV 'Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 at [7] ---[16] [2007] FCA 815 ; , 240 ALR 120 at 122---5.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 65"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FCA 2069">

22 To similar effect is the judgment of Mansfield J in Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v The Ship MV "Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 , which was, like Dataline , a case where judgment was given on the basis of deemed admissions under O 35A. Having noted the historical reluctance to base declarations on admissions, his Honour went on to approve and adopt the statements of Kiefel J in Dataline and to exercise his discretion to make declarations on the basis of those deemed admissions, at [13]-[16]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCA 1139">5 Each of the entities with a judgment against the ship has been given an opportunity to make written or oral submissions in respect of the final disposition of the funds now held in the ship account and in the bunker account including the priority with which those amounts should be paid. The only entity which has made any submission as to the priority of payment out is Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East. It claims the whole of the remaining proceeds of the two funds. It does so because it is a mortgagee of the ship: see Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v The Ship MV "Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815. </sentence>
