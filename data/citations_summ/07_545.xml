<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 363">In Retractable Technologies Inc v Occupational and Medical Innovations [2007] FCA 545 ; (2007) 72 IPR 58 , Greenwood J said at [90]: 
 In seeking the court's intervention to restrain use of confidential information it is essential that the applicant demonstrate with precision the information said to be confidential and the content of use sought to be attached. Assertions of confidentiality at high levels of abstraction will not establish a basis for relief against a disclosee. In the case of an innocent third party who simply seeks reliance upon a contract struck without notice of a relationship of confidentiality between the primary disclosor and any other party or breach, the requirement for precision is even more acute. The starting point is the identification of the relevant confidential information: Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No. 2) (above) per Deane J at CLR 438; ALR 208 ; IPR 560; Corrs Pavey Whiting &amp; Byrne v Collector of Customs (Vic) [1987] FCA 266 ; (1987) 14 FCR 434 at 443 ; [1987] FCA 266 ; 74 ALR 428 at 438; [1987] FCA 266 ; 10 IPR 53 at 63 ; [1987] FCA 266 ; 13 ALD 254 at 263 per Gummow J; O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 at 326-8 ; [1982] HCA 33 ; 41 ALR 255 at 266 per Mason J; Liberty Financial Pty Ltd v Scott (No 4) (2005) 11 VR 629 ; [2005] VSC 26 at [13] and [35] per Harper J; Pioneer Concrete Service Ltd v Galli [1985] VicRp 68 ; (1985) VR 675 at 711; [1985] VicRp 68 ; 4 IPR 227 at 241 per Crockett, Murphy &amp; Ormiston JJ.
