<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 781">In determining whether it is expedient or in the interests of justice to grant leave to raise a new ground, it is accepted that consideration needs to be given to the merits of the ground proposed to determine whether that ground has a reasonable prospect of success: MZWCL v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 635 at [35] ---[37]; Vishnumolakala v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 248 at [5] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 248">5 The two new grounds of appeal sought to be raised were not raised at the hearing before his Honour. The principles governing the grant of leave to argue new grounds are reasonably well settled. Leave should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so. In considering whether it is so in the interests of justice, it is necessary to give some consideration to the merits of the ground proposed, to determine whether they have reasonable prospects of success. Authorities in support of these well known propositions have been collected in a decision of my own, MZWCL v MIMIA [2006] FCA 635 at [35] and [36]. There is one matter which I would give particular attention to in considering the question of leave, and that is in some cases it is not only appropriate but necessary to have regard to the relation of what is now being sought to be done in the appeal to what was done at the trial.</sentence>
