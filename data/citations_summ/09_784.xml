<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 69">(5) It may still be appropriate to determine a separate question even if it will not resolve all the issues, provided that there is a strong prospect that the parties will agree upon the result when the core of the dispute has been decided or if the decision will obviate unnecessary and expensive hearings of other questions. (6) Generally speaking an issue will not be appropriate for separate determination if it is simply one of two or more alternative ways in which an applicant or plaintiff frames its case and its determination would leave other significant issues unresolved. (7) It is relevant to consider whether:
 the separate questions will contribute to the saving of time and cost by substantially narrowing the issues for trial or even lead to the disposal of the proceedings; they will contribute to the settlement of the proceedings; they will give rise to significant contested factual issues both at the time of the hearing of the preliminary question and at the time of the trial; there will be any significant overlap between the evidence adduced on the hearing of the separate question and a trial; the questions will prolong, rather than shorten, the proceedings: see too City of Swan v Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 784 ; (2009) 73 ACSR 86 at 95-96 [26] - [27] per myself. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] WASC 35">8 Whether an order for the separate trial of issues of liability should be ordered is a matter for the court's discretion. The court should approach the separate trial of issues with caution: Tepko Pty Ltd v Water Board [2001] HCA 19 ; (2001) 206 CLR 1. As a general rule the starting point is that all issues of fact and law should be determined at the one time: City of Swan v Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 784 ; (2009) 73 ACSR 86 (Rares J) [27].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] NSWSC 1372">(l) Often, a separate question is heard on the basis of:
 (i) agreed statements of fact;
 (ii) a narrow point to be determined; and
 (iii) a hearing that is able to be conducted within a short time (or a short time relative to the total length if the hearing of the separate question were not to be dealt with). (m) Factors that tend to support the making of an order, include that the separate determination of the question may: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) contribute to the saving of time and cost by substantially narrowing the issues for trial, or even lead to disposal of the proceedings: Tallglen v Pay TV Holdings; 
 (ii) contribute to the settlement of the litigation ( CBS Productions Pty Ltd v O'Neill (1985) 1 NSWLR 602 per Kirby P at 607). 
 
 
 
 
 (n) It may be appropriate to determine a separate question, even if it will not resolve all the issues, provided that there is a strong prospect that the parties will agree upon the result when the core of the dispute has been decided, or if the decision will obviate unnecessary and expensive hearings of other questions: City of Swan v Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 784 ; (2009) 73 ACSR 86 at [27] per Rares J. The determination of the one question should enable a sensible reassessment of litigation risks, which is generally likely to encourage some form of settlement discussions. (o) Relevantly, one factor that may tell against the making of an order would be where there is likely to be a significant overlap between the evidence adduced on the hearing of the separate question and at trial --- possibly involving the calling of the same witnesses at both stages of the hearing of the proceeding: Reading Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Mutual Provident Society at [8].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] WASC 137">4 In AWB Ltd v Cole (No 2) [2006] FCA 913 ; 233 ALR 453 Young J reviewed the authorities concerning O 29 r 2(a) of the Federal Court Rules which provides that the court may make orders for the decision of any question separately from any other question, whether before, at, or after any other trial. In City of Swan v Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 784 ; (2009) 73 ACSR 86 , Rares J at [27] in turn summarised the principles extracted from the relevant authorities by Young J as follows:
 
 (1) As a general rule the starting point is that all issues of fact and law should be determined at the one time. (2) A party seeking the determination of separate questions must satisfy the court that it is 'just and convenient' for the order to be made. The order must be made on concrete facts, either established or agreed, for the purpose of quelling a controversy between the parties so as to produce a conclusive or final judicial decision on the issue, which is of a real, not hypothetical, importance to the determination of the controversy.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] HCA 11">The plaintiffs alleged that the inclusion in the Deed of any or all of the three clauses mentioned earlier (cll 7.1, 9 and 11.5) entailed that the Deed was not a "valid" deed under Pt 5.3A. The plaintiffs proposed that there be argued separate questions directed to the proper construction of each of the impugned provisions, and to whether Pt 5.3A authorised their inclusion in a Deed of Company Arrangement. The defendants opposed adoption of that course but Rares J ordered [3] that eight questions be determined separately from, and before the trial of, the proceedings and that those questions be reserved for consideration by a Full Court of the Federal Court. Three questions (numbered 1, 3 and 5) were directed to issues of construction of each of the impugned provisions. The answers to those questions yielded the now undisputed construction of the provisions that is mentioned earlier in these reasons. Three questions (numbered 2, 4 and 6) asked, in effect, whether, on the construction of the relevant clause that was ultimately adopted, the relevant impugned provision was "valid and binding on the creditors of [Lehman Australia], having regard to sections 435A , 444A , 444D , 444H and Part 5.3A of the Act ".
