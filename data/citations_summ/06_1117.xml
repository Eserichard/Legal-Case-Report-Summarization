<citphrase id="cp2.1" type=cited from="[2005] FCAFC 220">all relevant admissions had been made. that is, the effect of fresenius' admissions and conduct led gambro to conclude, properly, that there was no suggestion that s 117 would not apply. whether the issue that fresenius sought to raise after delivery of the first decision, and now seeks to reagitate, was factual or legal, gambro's contention was that, had it known that there was such an issue, it would have run a case on authorisation. his honour accepted that contention. it follows that, even if the matters now sought to be raised are questions of law, the fact remains that, had gambro been aware that fresenius intended to raise an issue about the application of s 117, it would have run a different case. the primary judge thought that was a conclusive consideration. we see no error in his approach.</citphrase>
