<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1167">On 14 October 2009, I gave judgment for the applicant in this proceeding in respect of the beds described as "Ambassador --- Pocket Spring" and "Chiro Deluxe": Chiropedic Bedding Pty Ltd v Radburg Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1163 ; (2009) 181 FCR 446. I ordered that an account of the profits derived by the respondent from the sale of such beds be taken before a Registrar of the court pursuant to O 39 of the Federal Court Rules . An account of profits has now been taken before a Registrar, who has certified his account this morning pursuant to O 39 r 10 of the Federal Court Rules . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 55">248 Under the Designs Act 1906, an applicant could file a statement of monopoly or a statement of novelty, or both. The weight to be placed on a statement of novelty in the context of a challenge to validity was considered by Jessup J in the recent case of Chiropedic Bedding Pty Ltd v Radburg Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1163 ; (2009) 83 IPR 275 at 280-286 [7] - [22]. The particular problem addressed by Jessup J in that case does not arise under the Designs Act 2003 because that Act expressly states how a statement of newness and distinctiveness may be used on an application challenging the validity of a design: s 19(2)(b). Having regard to the primary judge's statements referred to in [222]-[223], I do not think that it can be said that she was unaware of the need to have particular regard to the particular visual features of the Designs identified in the statement of newness and distinctiveness as new and distinctive. </sentence>
