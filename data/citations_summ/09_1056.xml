<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1045">Such observations do not preclude the prospect that fact-finding may in some cases expose a lack of impartiality and may involve jurisdictional error: NADH , supra. Allsop J there thus observed: 
 
 [115] By and large fact-finding is a task within jurisdiction, though factual error is not necessarily mutually exclusive of jurisdictional error: ... Where fact-finding has been conducted in a manner which can be described, as here, as in substantial respects unreasoned, and mere assertion lacking rational or reasoned foundation, at times as plainly and ex facie wrong and as selective of material going one way, these considerations may found a conclusion that the posited fair-minded observer might, or indeed would, reasonably apprehend that the conclusions had been reached with a mind not open to persuasion and unable or unwilling to evaluate all the material fairly. ... [citations omitted] 
 

 
Appl'd: MZYAA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1303 at [28] per Goldberg J. See also: NAOX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1056 at [40] to [44] [2009] FCA 1056 ; , 112 ALD 54 at 60 to 61 per Spender J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 470">To overlook the opinion given by Mr Xiao is one thing. To consider but to remain mute about the opinion which was of real significance is quite another. To circumvent a judicial decision by constructing a decision which avoided a discussion of inconveniently relevant and important material would in my view not be a decision made in good faith: NAOX v Minister for Immigration [27] . The Tribunal found at [141] (CB 441) that the applicant was not a witness of truth and that she was not a Falun Gong practitioner in China. However, the Tribunal also found that the applicant was a Falun Gong practitioner in Australia and unless the opinion of Mr Xiao could in some way be discounted, at the time of her second visit to Australia, she was genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] HCA 16">The approach to be derived from the emphasised statement had been foreshadowed in Minister for Immigration v Eshetu (" Eshetu ") where Gummow J referred to "findings or inferences of fact which were not supported by some probative material or logical grounds" [69] . The approach was also anticipated in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (" S 20 ") where Gleeson CJ noted that one of the grounds of challenge to the Tribunal's decision was that it "was illogical, irrational, or was not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds" [70] . It was said by the appellant that since S20 a range of views had emerged in the Federal Court as to whether an illogical process of reasoning in the course of reaching a conclusion of fact amounts to a jurisdictional error [71] .
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 181">The fact that the applicant considered that he should have succeeded in his review application on the basis of his written claims is not such as to establish that there was any miscarriage of the discretion in s.426A of the Act. As discussed above, it was open to the Tribunal to take the view that it did on the material before it. It has not been established that there is any arguable case that it misdirected itself, failed to take into account a relevant consideration or acted in a " capricious or unreasonable manner " ( MZXTA at [32]) in the exercise of its discretion under s.426A. Nor can it be said that the exercise of the discretion or the subsequent decision was " unreasonable " in a Wednesbury sense (see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le and Others (2007) 164 FCR 151 ; [2007] FCA 1318 and NAOX and Another v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship and Another (2009) 112 ALD 54 ; [2009] FCA 1056). </sentence>
