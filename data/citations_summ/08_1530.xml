<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWADT 10">32 The Tribunal's role in this regard was considered by the Tribunal in Council of the New South Wales Bar Association v Butland [2009] NSWADT 177 , although in that matter the parties tendered a signed Instrument of Consent and invited the Tribunal to make orders by Consent under s 564(1) and s 154(1) of the 2004 Act . The Tribunal held:
&acirc;&#8364;&#339;29 Section 564(1) and (10) of the Legal Profession Act make it plain that the Tribunal has a discretion whether or not to make orders consented to in an instrument of consent under that section. The Tribunal does not act, nor should it be seen, as merely a "rubber stamp " - see the comments of the Federal Court in a similar context in Australian Communications and Media Authority v WE.NET.AU Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1530 at [8J. Nonetheless, the consents of the parties and the Legal Services Commissioner are matters that deserve significant weight. 30.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 790">There has only been one case to date under s 570 of the Telecommunications Act which is of very limited value in the context of this proceeding. In Australian Communications and Media Authority v WE.NET.AU Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1530 , a penalty of $6,000 was imposed in respect of a number of contraventions of the service provider. The conduct related to billing terms by a small Internet Service Provider and the imposition of a fee in the event of a billing dispute. The penalty ordered by the Court reflected an agreed penalty between the respondent and ACMA following a Court ordered mediation of the issue. The Court also took account of the parlous financial circumstances of the respondent in accepting the agreed penalty figure. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] NSWADT 177">29 Section 564(1) and (10) of the Legal Profession Act makes plain that the Tribunal has a discretion whether or not to make orders consented to in an instrument of consent under that section.
