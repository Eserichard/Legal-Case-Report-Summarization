<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 547">In Ruaro v Ferrari [2008] FCA 307 Emmett J (one of the majority in Dukemaster ) awarded indemnity costs where rejection of an offer had been "imprudent and unreasonable". His Honour did not refer to the authorities. In Olivaylle Pty Ltd v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA (No 5) [2009] FCA 571 Logan J indicated that, if there was any difference in substance between Black v Lipovac and Dukemaster he would (as had Sackville J) prefer to follow Black v Lipovac . In Alexander v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (No 3) [2010] FCA 506 Bromberg J also rejected a test of "plainly unreasonable", referring to Black v Lipovac . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 334">The respondents advanced an argument that they were entitled to costs on an indemnity basis or at least on the ordinary basis from 24 May 2010. Foundational to that submission was an offer the respondents made on 21 May 2010 to pay Entirity $20,000 in full and final settlement of the proceedings (including the cross-claim), with each party to bear their own costs. The offer was open until 24 May 2010. Counsel for Entirity asserted in written submissions (an assertion not put in issue in later written submissions from the respondents) that the offer was served in the afternoon of a Friday (21 May 2010) and was expressed to expire on the Monday (24 May 2010). Again not disputed, was the assertion that Entirity did not reject the offer but simply did not respond within the stipulated time. It is accepted that the power to award indemnity costs can be enlivened by an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise: Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 to [5] at 233 and more generally the recent discussion by Logan J in Olivaylle Pty Ltd v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA (No 5) [2009] FCA 571. Often this question is approached on the basis of whether the conduct of the party against whom indemnity costs are sought was unreasonable or imprudent: see Ruaro v Ferrari [2008] FCA 307 at [15] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 55">434 In the course of her reasons for judgment delivered on 18 December 2008, the primary Judge said that, during the course of the hearing before her, LED Technologies stated that it no longer sought relief against Mr Morrison. In final orders made on 24 February 2009, her Honour ordered that LED Technologies' claims against Mr Morrison be dismissed, and that it pay Mr Morrison's costs of those claims incurred after 10 April 2008. In her Honour's reasons given that day, the only reference to Mr Morrison's costs was the following:
 In relation to para 5 of the Orders, I have not awarded costs to the Fifth Respondent on an indemnity basis. Not only was the application not actively pursued at the hearing, I do not consider that the Fifth Respondent has established any basis for costs to be awarded on an indemnity basis: see Colgate-Palmolive Company and Another v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234 per Sheppard J; Bagshaw v Scott [2005] FCA 104 at [39] - [43] per Bennett J; Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (formerly known as Citicorp Australia Ltd) (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] per Finn J; Ruaro v Ferrari [2008] FCA 307 at [17] per Emmett J; Tadros v J &amp; R Investment Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 832 [13]-[16] per Buchanan J. Otherwise, her Honour contented herself with saying that the costs orders which she proposed to make (which included the order relating to Mr Morrison's costs) "deal with the issues of costs on the claim, the cross claims and the costs of those cross claims in the most appropriate manner". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 286">The written submissions of the Respondents, however, further correctly contend that an offer of compromise --- even one which fails to comply with the requirements of O 23 --- remains relevant to the manner of the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 43: DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v InterTAN Inc [2004] FCA 1251 ; Ruaro v Ferrari (" Ruaro ") [2008] FCA 307. In Ruaro Emmett J observed: 
 
 [15] I accept that there was no compliance with the regime contemplated by O 23 and that the failure to comply with that regime was not insignificant. On the other hand, the fact that a formal offer was made is, I consider, a relevant factor in determining whether the conduct of the plaintiffs was unreasonable or imprudent. The offers that were made were, apart from the failure to specify an amount of interest, in accordance with the form contemplated by O 23. On the other hand, there was nothing in the letters accompanying either offer to indicate to the plaintiffs why it would be unreasonable for them to reject or fail to accept the offers. However, the parties had explored the question of valuation at some length and all of the evidence concerning liability was available to the parties at the time when the offers were made.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 571">Flottweg's submissions did not gainsay the matters of principle for which the cases relied upon by Olivaylle stood, only the application of those principles in the circumstances of this particular case. In particular, Flottweg accepted that the mere fact that the result at trial left Olivaylle worse off than any pre-trial offer carried with it no presumptive entitlement to an award of indemnity costs. Rather, it was submitted that the question was whether the rejection of the offers (or at least one of them) was unreasonable or imprudent, the discussion and conclusions reached by Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [59] to [63] with respect to Black v Lipovac , supra and other authorities being adopted. Flottweg further submitted that, while it may not have been unreasonable or imprudent for Olivaylle to have instituted or, as the case may be, continued the litigation in the absence of one or more of the offers it made, at least one of those offers constituted a fair commercial compromise such that it was unreasonable or imprudent to institute or continue the litigation in the face of that offer. That sentiment, it was submitted, was evident in the approach taken by Emmett J in Ruaro v Ferrari [2008] FCA 307 at [17] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 141">In relation to para 5 of the Orders, I have not awarded costs to the Fifth Respondent on an indemnity basis. Not only was the application not actively pursued at the hearing, I do not consider that the Fifth Respondent has established any basis for costs to be awarded on an indemnity basis: see Colgate-Palmolive Company and Another v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234 per Sheppard J; Bagshaw v Scott [2005] FCA 104 at [39] - [43] per Bennett J; Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (formerly known as Citicorp Australia Ltd) (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] per Finn J; Ruaro v Ferrari [2008] FCA 307 at [17] per Emmett J ; Tadros v J &amp; R Investment Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 832 [13]-[16] per Buchanan J. </sentence>
