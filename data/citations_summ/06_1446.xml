<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWCA 27">65 Similar issues can arise in respect of the recovery of costs under mortgages and other finance transactions. In such cases, the amount recoverable will turn upon the proper construction of the contractual provision: see, eg, Ringrow Pty Ltd v BP Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1446 (Rares J). With respect to a mortgagee, the entitlement to recover all costs reasonably and properly incurred in protecting or enforcing a security has long been a principle of general law, not dependent upon the existence of an express contractual term: see In re Shanahan (1941) 58 WN (NSW) 132 at 134 (Street J). The principle applied in Shanahan was not novel: it is commonly sourced to Detillin v Gale [1802] EngR 330 ; (1802) 7 Ves Jun 583 ; 32 ER 234 (Lord Eldon LC) and Cotterell v Stratton (1872) LR 8 Ch App 295 (Lord Selborne LC): see Tyler, Young and Croft, Fisher &amp; Lightwood's Law of Mortgage (2nd Aust ed, 2005) at 40.1. It is usual practice nowadays for there to be a clause in a standard form mortgage entitling the mortgagee to recover all its costs; the enforcement of such terms and their interrelationship with costs rules in courts and tribunals was considered in Gomba Holdings (UK) Ltd v Minories Finance Ltd (No. 2) [1993] Ch 171 (EWCA) (Scott LJ). (The Court in Gomba (at 194) held that there was a procedure available within the Court for taxation of non-litigation costs, albeit on the contractual basis. In addition, the Court held that it had power to disallow a mortgagee's costs, as part of the power of a court of equity to fix the terms on which relief will be allowed. )</sentence>
