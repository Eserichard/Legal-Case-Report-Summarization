<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1609">5 On 29 December 2005, 4 January 2006 and on 19 January 2006 APRA filed notices of motion and statements of charge seeking orders that Mr Siminton be punished for contempt in respect of nine alleged breaches of the orders made by Sundberg J. The contempt charges were heard on 29 March 2006 and, on 30 March 2006, Merkel J found that Mr Siminton had committed contempt by breaching certain of the orders made by Sundberg J on 15 December 2006: see [2006] FCA 326. These included various contraventions of Order 2 (b) of his Honour's orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] VSC 9">79 The plaintiffs also say that no evidence has been adduced by or on behalf of Chris Ng to suggest that the breach was unintentional. That is true. However, I am not convinced that it would have been appropriate for me to take that fact into account in assessing whether the plaintiffs have proved, beyond reasonable doubt, knowledge on the part of Chris Ng of the wrongfulness of the transaction. [56] In any event, without having regard at all to the fact that Chris Ng himself has remained silent, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his awareness that the transaction constituted a breach. In that sense, at least, the breach was "contumacious". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1340"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 397">1 On 30 March 2006, I found that the respondent ('Siminton') had committed contempt by breaching and failing to comply with certain orders made by Sundberg J on 15 December 2006 ('the Sundberg J orders): see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton [2006] FCA 326 ('the first judgment'). These reasons for judgment use the terms employed in, and are to be read together with, the first judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 336">2 In reasons for judgment delivered in this matter today ([2006] FCA 326) I outlined the nature of the present proceeding and the orders made by Sundberg J, Gray J and myself. It is unnecessary to repeat that outline.</sentence>
