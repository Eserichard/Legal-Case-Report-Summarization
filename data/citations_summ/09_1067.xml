<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 968">Although directions had also been made for the filing of written submissions, no written submissions had been filed by the appellant. Written submissions had been filed on behalf of the first respondent. Those submissions were supplemented orally this morning by reference SZLWB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 1067 at [24] where Besanko J said: 
 
 With respect to the issue of adequate state protection, the High Court considered the relevant principles in Respondents S152/2003 . Adequate state protection is relevant to a claim for refugee status because, if it is available, an applicant will have difficulty in showing that he is a victim of persecution, or in establishing that he is justified in his unwillingness to seek the protection of his country of nationality (at 9 [21], 13 [29] per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ). Adequate state protection does not mean a guarantee of safety.</sentence>
