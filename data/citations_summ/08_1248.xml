 139 Seabay submitted that Galvin's Payment Claim 28 was invalid because it did not adequately identify the construction work to which the claim for the sum of $1,987,61.25 related. In particular it said that the payment claim did not comply with s.14(2)(c) and (d) of the Act because it failed to identify the work performed between the two relevant reference dates to which the payment claim related. Indeed, the payment claim, it was said, was in a form identical to that considered by Finkelstein J in Protectavale Pty Ltd v K2K Pty Ltd, [26] where his Honour found the payment claim to be invalid because of a failure to describe the work the subject of the claim. On this basis it was submitted that, as Payment Claim 28 did not comply with the Act and was invalid, the Adjudicator had no jurisdiction to determine the matter. 140 The Adjudicator considered these arguments but rejected them.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] VSCA 99">27 In my opinion, the trial judge was right to grant summary judgment. I respectfully adopt the words of Finkelstein J in Protectavale Pty Ltd v K2K Pty Ltd, [23] that the payment claim regime: [24] 
 
 
 places the claimant in a privileged position in the sense that he acquires rights that go beyond his contractual rights. [25] The premise that underlies the legislation is that cash flow is the lifeblood of the construction industry [26] and that the principal under a construction contract should pay now and argue later.

 47 Finkelstein J in Protectavale Pty Ltd v K2K Pty Ltd [23] expressed a similar view in considering the requirements of s.14(2)(a) when he said: [24] 
 
 
 It is necessary to decide whether the invoice meets the requirements of s 14. 
 
 
 180 Finkelstein J described a "final payment claim" in the following terms in Protectavale, [90] which I accept: 
 
 
 A final payment claim may be defined as a "final balancing of account between the contracting parties" ( Jemzone Pty Ltd v Trytan Pty Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR at 49) or "simply the last of the payment claims" ( Southern Region Pty Ltd v State of Victoria (No 3) [2001] VSC 436 at [32] ). As Finkelstein J said in Protectavale: [89] 
 
 
 Progress payments are effectively payments by instalments or periodic payments made over the life of the contract for construction work already completed. [106] 
225 In the present case, each of the relevant construction contracts drew a clear distinction between a progress payment and what may be described as a final payment.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] VSC 156">56 As Finkelstein J observed in Protectavale Pty Ltd v K2K Pty Ltd, [18] the payment claim and payment schedule define the issues in dispute between the parties which the adjudicator is to resolve, and limit the points which may be the subject of submissions to the adjudicator: Parist Holdings Pty Ltd v WT Partnership Australia Pty Ltd; [19] Multiplex Constructions Pty Ltd v Luikens. [20]  55 Accordingly, there are three possible outcomes of this process under the Act, in its current amended form. [17] First, if the respondent does not provide a payment schedule within due time, whether intentionally (because he disputes the claim) or unintentionally, he becomes liable to pay the claimed amount: s.16, and may, at the option of the claimant, be subject to an adjudication application: s.18(1)(b). Second, if the respondent does provide a payment schedule and the scheduled amount is the same as the claimed amount, he becomes liable under the Act to pay the amount claimed: s.17. The third possible outcome (which is confined to the outcome which arose in this case and does not include two other possible outcomes described in s.18(1)(a)(ii) and s.18(1)(b)) occurs if the respondent provides a payment schedule but the scheduled amount is less than the claimed amount, the claimant may apply within ten business days after the claimant has received the payment schedule to have the dispute adjudicated by an appointed adjudicator (an adjudication application): s.18(1)(a)(i) and s.18(3)(c).  12 In my opinion a court should, wherever possible, expeditiously deal with short points of law or construction. [2] This is particularly so in cases in a managed list such as the Building Cases List. [3] The benefit of this approach is enhanced in this case because what is fundamentally at stake is the question of Schiavello's immediate right to payment, or otherwise, of a substantial progress payment or progress payments for building works. The outcome will have a direct affect on the cash flow of both parties. Further, there is no dispute as to the relevant material facts; the case was able to be presented as a trial upon the affidavits filed, without cross-examination. The only question is the legal effect of a payment claim for a progress payment or progress payments served by Schiavello on Hickory purportedly under the Subcontract and the Act. Finally, the purposes of the Act in achieving expedition in the resolution of progress claims will be advanced by adopting this course and diminished if it is not.  53 The requirements of s.14 of the Act should not be approached in an overly technical manner. Finkelstein J in Protectavale Pty Ltd v K2K Pty Ltd said: [16] 
 
 It is necessary to decide whether the invoice meets the requirements of s 14. The test is an objective one; that is, it must be clear from the terms of the document that it contains the required information: Walter Construction Group Ltd v CPL (Surry Hills) Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 266 at [82] . But the terms must be read in context. Payment claims are usually given and received by parties experienced in the building industry who are familiar with the particular construction contract, the history of the project and any issues which may have arisen between them regarding payment. Those matters are part of the context: Multiplex Constructions [2003] NSWSC 1140 at [76] . The manner in which compliance with s 14 is tested is not overly demanding: Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Campbelltown Catholic Club Ltd [2003] NSWSC 1103 at [54] citing Hawkins Construction (Aust) Pty Ltd v Mac's Industrial Pipework Pty Ltd [2002] NSWCA 136 at [20] ("[The requirements for a payment claim] should not be approached in an unduly technical manner ... As the words are used in relation to events occurring in the construction industry, they should be applied in a commonsense practical manner"); Multiplex Constructions [2003] NSWSC 1140 at [76] ("[A] payment claim and a payment schedule must be produced quickly; much that is contained therein in an abbreviated form which would be meaningless to the uninformed reader will be understood readily by the parties themselves"); Minimax Fire Fighting Systems Pty Ltd v Bremore Engineering (WA Pty Ltd) [2007] QSC 333 at [20] ("The Act emphasises speed and informality. Accordingly one should not approach the question whether a document satisfies the description of a payment schedule (or payment claim for that matter) from an unduly critical viewpoint"). </sentence>
