<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 41">44 Secondly, the course urged upon us would require, at a minimum, satisfaction that the analysis in Lay Lat was plainly or clearly wrong (see generally Cooper v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1063 ; (2004) 139 FCR 205 at [46] ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZANS [2005] FCAFC 41 ; (2005) 141 FCR 586 at [38] ; BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council [2007] FCAFC 157 ; (2007) 162 FCR 234 at [83] - [89]; and Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1341 ; (2007) 163 FCR 318 at [8] ). In the circumstances of the present case, consideration of that issue would engage the principles we referred to earlier about the importance of comity in relation to questions of statutory construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 119">59 Two days before the hearing of the present appeal a Full Court of this Court delivered judgment in SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83 ( 'SZKTI') . In that judgment the Full Court considered and rejected a number of the arguments also advanced to us by counsel for the Minister about the proper construction of s 424 of the Act. Shortly after judgment was reserved in the present appeal, the Minister's legal representatives sought leave to make further submissions about the effect of SZKTI . Leave was granted to both parties. The appellant relied on SZKTI . The Minister argued it was 'clearly wrong' and should not be followed. Considerations of comity would normally suggest that the present appeal not be decided upon a basis inconsistent with the judgment of another Full Court about relevantly similar legal issues. There are limited exceptions to this general rule. The Minister's submission that SZKTI was 'clearly wrong' attempts to invoke such an exception (see Cooper v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1063 ; (2004) 139 FCR 205 at [46] ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZANS [2005] FCAFC 41 ; (2005) 141 FCR 586 at [38] ; SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at [148] , BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council [2007] FCAFC 157 ; (2007) 162 FCR 234 at [83] - [89] and Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1341 ; (2007) 163 FCR 318 at [8] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 749">In Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1341 Jessup J considered a claim for costs involving proceedings concerning two separate claims under federal statutes. His Honour's approach (which followed Seven Network ) to the issue was upheld on appeal (see Bahonko v Sterjov [2008] FCAFC 30). In the course of his decision His Honour said: "6. In Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1341 at [7] Jessup J noted the conclusion of Black CJ in Nikolich that section 170CS (now section 666) should be given the same operation as section 347 (now section 824). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCAFC 30">1 The judgments under appeal ( Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1244 and Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1341 ; [2007] 163 FCR 318) dealt with applications under s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) ('the HREOC Act') alleging unlawful racial discrimination and under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the WR Act') alleging unlawful dismissal and other unlawful conduct. The claims based on statute were dismissed although the appellant was found, having regard to the pleadings, to have been defamed. She was awarded $50 nominal damages in the absence of evidence of harm. Although costs of the main proceedings and of various interlocutory applications were, in part, awarded against the appellant she was afforded a substantial measure of protection against costs as a result of the operation of s 170CS(1) of the WR Act (as it applied at the relevant time).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 38">The Respondent sought its costs on two bases. The first was that the Applicant's SDA claim had largely failed. It was submitted the authority of Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1341 (" Bahonko ") compelled the conclusion that costs in this regard followed the event. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 2086">17 On the other hand, in Seven Network (Operations) Ltd v Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance [2004] FCA 637 ; (2004) 148 FCR 145 ('Seven Network Operations' ) Gyles J held (at [61]) that a separate federal claim under a different federal statute was not 'in a matter arising under' the WR Act within the meaning of the statutory predecessor to s 824(1) (s 347(1) which is indistinguishable). His Honour concluded, in that case, that costs should be awarded, but only such costs as 'would not have been incurred in relation to the s 347 cause of action in any event and are only attributable to the other successful causes of action'. In Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1341 Jessup J followed Seven Network Operations observing that it appeared to be 'the only occasion upon which the Court has decided a costs application by reference to the fact that the proceeding involved claims arising under different federal statutes, one of which was the WR Act'. I should follow the same course.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1717">11 On 31 August 2007 Jessup J made orders as to costs in the substantive proceedings: Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1341. The orders made by Jessup J on 31 August 2007 were:
 
 
 1. The applicant pay the respondents' costs of proceeding VID 756/2006 to the extent that such costs were incurred on or before 6 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1555">10 On 31 August 2007, Jessup J made orders as to costs in the substantive proceedings ("the Costs Orders"): see Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1341. On 21 September 2007, Ms Bahonko amended her Notice of Appeal to appeal the Costs Orders ("the Amended Notice of Appeal").
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1556">17 In relation to other purported contempt claims made by Ms Bahonko about the evidence given by witnesses during the course of the trial before Jessup J, there is no basis for those allegations to be made, let alone heard and determined. The fact of the claim is referred to in para [25] of the reasons for decision of Jessup J reported at [2007] FCA 1341. The credibility of the witnesses was addressed by Jessup J in his reasons for decision and are reflected in the Substantive Orders and the Costs Orders which are the subject of the Appeal. The appeal process is the procedure to be adopted by Ms Bahonko if she seeks to challenge the findings made by Jessup J.</sentence>
