<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1567">Section 136 is headed "Release of Goods to Owner --- No Action for Infringement and s 137 is headed "Action for Infringement of Trade Mark". Some discussion has arisen in earlier authorities, including Jemella v Mackinnon &amp; Another [2008] FCA 1022 ; 77 IPR 243 , in which Logan J had to consider whether non-compliance with these provisions as to commencement and notification within the extension period, might have the effect of depriving the applicant of its standing to maintain infringement proceedings. I am satisfied that ss 136 and 137 , taken together, do not deprive the applicant of its standing to maintain proceedings for infringement of the trade mark. Section 137 is not a primary empowering provision conferring rights of action in the applicant.</sentence>
