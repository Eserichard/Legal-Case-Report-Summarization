<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1423">The background facts relevant to this long-running proceeding have been previously recounted: Wenkart v Pantzer (No 8) [2004] FCA 280 at [2] to [37] per Lindgren J; In the matter of Thomas Richard Wenkart, Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589 at [1] to [35] per Branson J; Wenkart v Pantzer [2009] FCA 1086 at [1] to [10]. They need not now be repeated. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1408">In respect to the legal costs now claimed by Dr Wenkart, the submission was that he should be entitled to an order for legal costs in his favour up to 10 January 2005. That date was the date calculated by the Deputy District Registrar when issuing her certificate as being the date 28 days after the determination of the quantum of an amount to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled: cf. Wenkart v Pantzer [2009] FCA 1086 at [30]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 866">The order was made by Branson J in September 2008 for an inquiry to be held by a Registrar. That inquiry was held and, in Wenkart v Pantzer [2009] FCA 1086 , it was concluded that: 
 
 [59] For the purposes of O 39 r 10(4) of the Federal Court Rules , it is thus concluded that the " weight " to be given to the Certificate of the Deputy Registrar dated 28 May 2009 is such that a finding should be made, consistent with the terms of the order for referral, that the date on which 28 days has passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs and charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66 is 10 January 2005. 
 

 
That decision regrettably --- with the benefit of hindsight --- did not resolve the submission previously advanced as to the application of the rule in Cherry v Boultbee : [2009] FCA 1086 at [57] . The decision, however, clearly contemplated as follows the ambit of the orders to be made:
 
 
 [61] Orders should now be made (if necessary) which give effect to the prior decisions of Her Honour Justice Branson, the Certificate as issued by the Deputy District Registrar on 28 May 2009 and the present reasons for decision. As previously contemplated by Her Honour in her reasons for decision as published in September 2008, it is appropriate that the parties have a further opportunity to make submissions as to the appropriate orders to be made --- should that be necessary. 
 

 
The course of the hearing then conducted to determine the weight to be given to the Certificate is set forth in those reasons for decision --- including the reliance placed upon earlier decisions supporting each of the amounts set forth in the table and the limited additional factual material sought to be relied upon. The table, upon analysis, was really no more than an arithmetical presentation chronologically setting forth findings which had previously been made by Branson J. Whatever the table did and however it may have been prepared and presented, the " weight " to be given to the Certificate has now been resolved by the September 2009 judgment.  On 25 September 2009 reasons for yet a further decision in this long-running dispute were published: Wenkart v Pantzer [2009] FCA 1086. It was then stated that that decision and reasons would " hopefully [be] one of the last to be resolved between the parties ".  Given the conclusion of Branson J in Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478 , and the subsequent comments made in Wenkart v Pantzer [2009] FCA 1086 , it is simply said that no further claim for relief may now be advanced.  The order was made by Branson J in September 2008 for an inquiry to be held by a Registrar. That inquiry was held and, in Wenkart v Pantzer [2009] FCA 1086 , it was concluded that: 
 
 [59] For the purposes of O 39 r 10(4) of the Federal Court Rules , it is thus concluded that the " weight " to be given to the Certificate of the Deputy Registrar dated 28 May 2009 is such that a finding should be made, consistent with the terms of the order for referral, that the date on which 28 days has passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs and charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66 is 10 January 2005. 
 

 
That decision regrettably --- with the benefit of hindsight --- did not resolve the submission previously advanced as to the application of the rule in Cherry v Boultbee : [2009] FCA 1086 at [57] . The decision, however, clearly contemplated as follows the ambit of the orders to be made:
 
 
 [61] Orders should now be made (if necessary) which give effect to the prior decisions of Her Honour Justice Branson, the Certificate as issued by the Deputy District Registrar on 28 May 2009 and the present reasons for decision. As previously contemplated by Her Honour in her reasons for decision as published in September 2008, it is appropriate that the parties have a further opportunity to make submissions as to the appropriate orders to be made --- should that be necessary. 
 

 
The course of the hearing then conducted to determine the weight to be given to the Certificate is set forth in those reasons for decision --- including the reliance placed upon earlier decisions supporting each of the amounts set forth in the table and the limited additional factual material sought to be relied upon. The table, upon analysis, was really no more than an arithmetical presentation chronologically setting forth findings which had previously been made by Branson J. Whatever the table did and however it may have been prepared and presented, the " weight " to be given to the Certificate has now been resolved by the September 2009 judgment.  Although the focus of earlier decisions may have been, for whatever reason, upon when a period of 28 days had expired when amounts exceeded $769,191.66, the fact is that the dates upon which payments were made by Mr Pantzer have received repeated attention in: the decision of Branson J in April 2008; the decision of Branson J in September 2008 when Her Honour declined to " reconsider " or " withdraw " paragraphs of her earlier decision; 
and in:
 the inquiry conducted by the Deputy District Registrar. Moreover, little constraint was imposed upon the litigants when:
 the hearing was held to resolve objections which were taken to the Certificate of the Deputy District Registrar --- that hearing being a " rehearing " ([2009] FCA 1086 at [23]). It is thus concluded that it is not now open for Mr Pantzer to seek to place reliance upon factual material seeking to question the factual account now set forth in the table.  If the parties are unable to reach agreement on this question, I propose to make an order for the making of an inquiry by a Registrar ( O 39, rr 2 and 9 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 Cth ). 
 

It was this proposed order, later made on 16 September 2008, that led to the Deputy District Registrar holding an inquiry and certifying that " the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr. Pantzer is lawfully entitled from Dr. Wenkart ... is 10 January 2005 ". A hearing to resolve an " objection " to that certificate was heard and resolved in September 2009: Wenkart v Pantzer [2009] FCA 1086. </sentence>
