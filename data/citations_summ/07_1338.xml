<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 559">The Federal Magistrate accepted the appellant's submission that the letter of 14 August 2007 was a request for a personal identifier (at [27]). Accordingly, the Federal Magistrate found the application for a protection visa to be invalid (at [27]). However, the Federal Magistrate considered that s 69 of the Migration Act applied with the consequence that the decision relating to the invalid application was preserved (at [30], citing SZIWV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1338). Section 69 provides that: 
 (1) Non-compliance by the Minister with Subdivision AA or AB or section 494D in relation to a visa application does not mean that a decision to grant or refuse to grant the visa is not a valid decision but only means that the decision might have been the wrong one and might be set aside if reviewed. 

 
 (2) If the Minister deals with a visa application in a way that complies with Subdivision AA, AB and this Subdivision, the Minister is not required to take any other action in dealing with it. 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 254">SZIWV v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1338 was a case in which the facts are substantially similar to those presently before the court. The applicant had signed a blank application and there were doubts about the validity of the jurat. At [19] the court sets out the findings of the Federal Magistrate which it was considering on appeal: "The Federal Magistrate held that the appellant signed the statutory declaration although she was not aware she was signing a statutory declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1954">23 The conduct of the migration agent was the subject of inquiry and findings by the Tribunal. In the present proceedings it is not considered that the conduct of the agent, however it be described, has occasioned prejudice to the Appellant. Unlike the position in SZFDE , the present Appellant was advised of the hearings before each of the Tribunals and did, in fact, attend: see SZIWV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) FCA 1338 at [27] . </sentence>
