 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Introduction 
 The Applicant, Lili Kang in her application seeks orders for reinstatement to her former position of employment as an APS6 employee of the Attorney-General's Department. She claims that she was unlawfully dismissed within the meaning provided in section 559(2)(a) and/or (e) of the Workplace Relations Act . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 571">Section 664 is substantially identical to s.170CQ of the WR Act as it stood prior to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (" WorkChoices Act" ) The authorities on s.170CQ and the predecessor provisions are therefore relevant: (see e.g., Laz v Downer Group Ltd at [255] per Moore J and Claveria v Pilkington Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 1692 at [8] per Kenny J). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FMCA 2104">Fairfax's submission relies too heavily on a reading of the Act which limits the sections relied upon by Mr Dowling to the protection of employees from adverse treatment because of their possible interaction, to use a neutral term, with an industrial association. Although the objects of pt.16 are, amongst other things, to protect rights to freedom of association, the protections provided by the sections relied upon by Mr Dowling cannot be limited by the objects set out in s.778 , if only because the section itself says so. But in any event, generally an objects clause in a statute can only be an aid to interpretation; it cannot justify an interpretation which contradicts the clear words of the enactment. Further, it was not submitted by either of the parties that the provisions in question amount to an enactment into Australian law of an international Convention which might require a more liberal construction of the statute than the common law would usually allow: Claveria v Pilkington Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 1692 at [95] . Here, the provisions which Mr Dowling relies on are not ostensibly limited to circumstances where a person proposes an inquiry of or a complaint to an industrial association, as that expression is defined in s.779. It is to be noted that they make no reference to industrial bodies or industrial associations, and thus are unlike most of the other paragraphs in s.793(1). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1917">In Kelly at [14] Tracey J adopted "as potentially relevant and applicable" to the question of penalty the "non-exhaustive range of considerations" referred to by Mowbray FM in Mason . Plainly enough, the particular circumstances of the contravention are relevant. These circumstances are set out in my earlier reasons for judgment: see generally Claveria v Pilkington Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 1692 , especially at [148]. This case involved the one breach, which occurred on the day of Mr Claveria's termination. In my previous reasons for judgment, I referred to the nature of the respondent's business.</sentence>
