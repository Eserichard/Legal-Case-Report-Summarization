 TABLE OF CONTENTS 
 

 
 Introduction 
 There are three applications before me. The first is a Notice for Specific Directions filed on 3 May 2007 by Andrew Morton Garrett in Action Number SCCIV-96-2244 ("Action 2244 of 1996"). Whilst I will not endeavour to comment on each proceeding instituted by Mr Garrett in the Federal Court, I will make the following observations. In the course of the 21 actions, at least 20 proceedings instituted by Mr Garrett in the actions were dismissed, struck-out or refused. Reasons were published for the majority of these decisions, and within these reasons the proceedings instituted by Mr Garrett are described, inter alia , as "hopelessly misconceived", [227] "incoherent", [228] "embarrassing", [229] "vexatious", [230] "ostensibly untenable" [231] and as having "no reasonable prospect of success".

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 525">Even assuming (which is not shown) the trust itself has no readily available assets to fund the instructing of a solicitor, the beneficiaries themselves may be in a position to do so. They may need to consider whether the causes of action are worth pursuing before doing so; that is a matter for them. Moreover, as Finn J said in Garrett [2007] FCA 439 , at [19], the claim itself has an air of unreality. The applicant said he is an undischarged bankrupt, and his capacity to secure and negotiate banking instruments of this value in the circumstances he claims seems highly unlikely. As I put to him, his simple solution if the funds are available to him as trustee is to arrange for them to be transferred at source to a better known banking institution whose instruments would be readily verifiable. 16 
 
First, in matter SAD 9 of 2007, the applicant brought the application in his capacity as trustee of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3; as trustee for "Corporate Investments" pursuant to a declaration of trust dated 31 December 2006; and as trustee of the Andrew Garrett Group &amp; Corporate Investments Joint Venture. In these proceedings, the applicant has brought the action only in his capacity as the trustee of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3. In Garrett [2007] FCA 439 , at [20], Finn J found that the applicant did not have standing in any of his capacities, including as trustee of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3, in relation to the first Sight Draft. His Honour found that the applicant did have standing in his capacity as trustee of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3 to have brought the application in respect of the second Sight Draft, but dismissed the claim for reasons he gave. The more limited standing relied upon by the applicant in this matter would, for the same reasons, not affect the result here. 14 On 26 March 2007, Finn J ordered that the applicant's application in matter SAD 9 of 2007 be summarily dismissed with costs: see Garrett v Westpac Banking Corporation [2007] FCA 439. I will not refer in detail to his Honour's reasons. I respectfully agree with them. As a consequence, to the extent that these proceedings raise the same issues as matter SAD 9 of 2007, I would dismiss this application. In oral submissions, the applicant said that his Honour, when considering the application of the Bills of Exchange Act 1909 (Cth), had based his decision on s 59 of that Act and had failed to have regard to s 28(1) of that Act. That is quite incorrect: see his Honour's reasons as [23]. In my view, the statement of claim discloses no cause of action that has any reasonable prospect of success. 19 There may also be a more fundamental reason why this claim must now be dismissed. Matter SAD 9 of 2007 involved the same claims between the same parties based upon the same alleged conduct. Relevantly, the essence of the claim in each matter was that the first respondent and its officers had failed to meet the first and second Sight Drafts so as to make available in the account of the applicant as trustee of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3 the funds to which they referred. The causes of action in each matter are the same. The issues as to whether any of those causes of action are reasonably arguable have been decided in Garrett [2007] FCA 439. The difference in the nature of the relief sought does not mean those issues have not been decided. The applicant should be estopped in any event from litigating in this proceeding the same issues as he raised in that matter simply because he claims a different (but misconceived) form of relief.</sentence>
