<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 460">It is well-established that there is no obligation upon the Tribunal to provide to an applicant a copy of transcript or recordings of a Departmental interview. True it is that there is a requirement that the Tribunal provide a copy of a recording of its own hearing, but it is under no obligation to provide an applicant before it with a transcript or a recording of the Departmental interview. I refer to SZKOB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [7] where Flick J said at [12]: First, it is not considered that there was any requirement to provide the Appellant with transcript or recording of the interview. In some circumstances fairness may require a transcript of proceedings to be provided: see National Companies &amp; Securities Commission v Bankers Trust Australia Ltd [1989] FCA 530 ; [1989] FCA 530 ; (1989) 24 FCR 217. There is, however, no immutable requirement to do so: see Adler v Cantwell (1988) 14 ACLR 658. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 211">As it discloses no error on the part of the Federal Magistrate, the balance of the second particular/ground must therefore be rejected. The remaining particulars/grounds (3 to 6 inclusive) essentially complain about the Tribunal's failure to provide the appellant with a record, whether by way of a compact disc or a transcript, of the appellant's interview with the Department so that she could explain or clarify the inconsistencies that the Tribunal said were apparent from what she said in that interview and what she said at the hearing before the Tribunal. This is the same complaint as was made in SZKOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1949 , where Flick J rejected that complaint stating that: "Neither that Part nor any other provision of the 1958 Act requires a claimant to be provided with a transcript or a tape recording of an interview with the Department. ": see at [13] and also at [14]. I respectfully agree with his Honour's conclusions in this respect. Finally, with regard to the appellant's contention that she should have been provided with a record of her interview with the delegate, his Honour followed the reasoning of Flick J in SZKOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1949 and held that there was no requirement to do so in the Act. Otherwise, his Honour found that the appellant was "essentially ... cavilling at the Tribunal's factual findings and [was] ... therefore no more than an attempt at merits review": see [2008] FMCA 1581 at [43] .  Accordingly, there was nothing in the decision of the Tribunal which would allow an inference to be drawn that "a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the [Tribunal] might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided": Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at [27] - [32]. There is no provision of the Act that requires either the Department or the Tribunal to provide to the appellant a record of her interview with the delegate. The appellant's challenge to the "significant inconsistencies" identified by the Tribunal was a challenge to the Tribunal's fact finding role and therefore amounted to an attempt to conduct merits review which was not available on a judicial review: see SZKOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1949 at [17] per Flick J. CONSIDERATION 
 In my view, the two stated grounds of appeal are so general as to be meaningless. I will therefore assume that the essence of the appellant's concerns about the Federal Magistrate's decision are contained in the particulars of the two stated grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 99">Ground 6 claims that the appellant was not provided with a tape-recording of her interview with the delegate, although the section 424A letter does refer to the interview tape. However, there is authority in the decision of Flick J in SZKOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1949 at [12] --- [14] that the Tribunal was not obliged to provide the tape recording. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1690">If a Tribunal makes a material finding of fact or draws an inference without probative evidence it will fall into jurisdictional error MIMIA v VOAO, VOAP [2005] FCAFC 50 per Wilcox, French and Finkelstein JJ at [5]; SFGB v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 231 per Mansfield, Selway and Bennett JJ at [19] and [30]; QAAA v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1918 per Collier J at [22]. In this case only the Tribunal had the benefit of listening to the tape of the delegate's interview. There is no obligation to do this; SZKOB v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1949 per Flick J at [12]. It has not been produced in this court. The Tribunal did not ask the applicant any questions about the biscuit shop.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1866">52 I do not consider it was incumbent upon the Third Tribunal to accede to the appellant's request for a transcript of previous Tribunal hearings, even if they were available: see generally SZKOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1949 at [12] - [14] per Flick J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 1581">It was also submitted that no jurisdictional error arises by reason of the Tribunal's failure to provide the Applicant with a transcript or record of her interview with the delegate ( SZKOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [13] at [13] per Flick J). There was no unfairness. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 1535">In that regard I agree, with respect, with the views expressed by Flick J in SZKOB v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1949 at [10] and [12]. There may be cases where the obligation to ensure a real hearing opportunity pursuant to s.425 compels the Tribunal to produce a sound recording for departmental interview and either listen to it or provide it to the applicant. This is not such a case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1361">14 His Honour held that there was no obligation on the Tribunal to provide the appellant with a transcript of the Departmental interview because s 424A of the Act requires only that the Tribunal provide the appellant with particulars of the information that may be the reason or part of the reason for its decision; and not any document referrable to those particulars. His Honour relied upon Nader v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2000) 101 FCR 352 ; [2000] FCA 908 (' Nader' ) and SZKOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1949 in support. Accordingly, his Honour was satisfied that the Tribunal had complied with its obligations in this regard by providing particulars of the relevant information in the transcript of the Departmental interview. 21 The first respondent had earlier filed an outline of written submissions. In summary, that outline set out the following submissions:
 
&#8226; S 424A of the Act does not require the Tribunal to provide a copy of the document which forms the "reason, or a part of the reason" for the Tribunal's decision; it only requires the Tribunal to provide particulars of any information that answers that description: SZKOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1949 at [13] --- [14]. &#8226; The Tribunal complied with its obligations under s 425 , as interpreted by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 228 CLR 152 ; [2006] HCA 63 , by putting to her in writing (in its letter dated 12 July 2007) the particulars of the inconsistencies it considered existed between the information she gave at the Departmental interview and the evidence she provided to the Tribunal. &#8226; Any person asserting actual bias on the part of the Tribunal carries a heavy onus. The allegation must be distinctly made and clearly proved: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507 ; [2001] HCA 17. In this case the appellant had not filed any evidence to support her allegation of bias and there was no basis upon which that allegation could be proven. &#8226; The Federal Magistrate conducted a clear and comprehensive review of all of the grounds raised by the appellant, both written and oral. There was no error of law amounting to jurisdictional error in the Federal Magistrate's reasons for decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 797">More recently in SZKOB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1949 , an applicant alleged an error on the part of the Tribunal by it not providing a transcript of the visa application interview conducted by the Department. Justice Flick said at [13] to [14] of that decision: [13] The content of the requirements of procedural fairness is to be determined by reference to the context in which a particular dispute arises including, in particular, the legislative regime being administered. In the present circumstances, s 422B of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides that Div 4 of Pt 7 "is taken too be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule". Neither that Part nor any other provision of the 1958 Act requires a claimant to be provided with a transcript or a tape recording of an interview with the Department. [14] Even in the absence of s 422B, it is not considered that the common law rules of procedural fairness require the provision of a transcript or a tape recording of the interview on 10 October 2006. Notwithstanding expected difficulties which may arise with respect to a person whose English language proficiency is severely limited, the factual matters being considered are within a narrow compass and are matters within the knowledge of the Appellant. Although there may be potential for misunderstandings between those participating in the interview process, the necessity to retain a tape recording of such interviews or to provide a transcript seems to be an unwarranted formality not required by the common law. </sentence>
