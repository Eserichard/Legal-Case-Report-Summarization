<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 413">ASIC submitted that the documents which it produced pursuant to the Notices to Produce were privileged from production and inspection on the grounds of PII and, in respect of two of the documents, on the ground of legal professional privilege. I consider that the documents in respect of which legal professional privilege is claimed are so privileged from production for inspection. I am satisfied that they have come into existence for the purpose of a client seeking legal advice in relation to subject-matter set out in the documents. The fact that those documents have been communicated to ASIC does not destroy the privilege as I consider that there is a common interest between ASIC and the relevant client in relation to the subject-matter recorded in the documents: Bank of Nova Scotia v Hellenic Mutual War Risks Association (Bermuda) Ltd (The Good Luck) [1992] 1 AC 233 ; Network Ten Ltd v Capital Television Holdings Ltd (1995) 36 NSWLR 275 ; Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1995) 37 NSWLR 405 at 410-411; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1998) 81 FCR 526 ; University of Western Australia v Gray (No 12) [2007] FCA 396 at [4] ; Heydon JD, Cross on Evidence (7 th Australian ed, 2004), [25265]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1223">7 Heydon J D, Cross on Evidence (7 th Australian ed, 2004) sets forth as follows the circumstances in which a common interest privilege may arise (at [25265]):
 Where in circumstances of a mutual interest in a particular transaction or transactions the recipient of legal advice relating to such transactions passes documents or information containing that advice to someone who shares that interest, the essential question in each case is whether the nature of their mutual interest in the context of their relationship is such that the party to whom the documents are passed receives them subject to a duty of confidence which the law will protect in the interests of justice. Two persons interested in a particular question will not have a common interest if their individual interests in the question are selfish and potentially adverse to each other. ... 
See also: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 12) [2007] FCA 396 at [4] per French J. Potential differences in the respective positions of parties may lead to their not having a " common interest ": eg, Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1995) 37 NSWLR 405 at 410. Thus, in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1998) 81 FCR 526 , no common interest privilege arose as between the Commission and entities providing witness statements to the Commission in circumstances where the Commission was asserting that those entities had been involved in breaches of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). " In that respect they each had interests which were either adverse, or potentially adverse, to each other. In such circumstances common interest privilege cannot arise as there is no common interest ": (1998) 81 FCR at 564 per Goldberg J.</sentence>
