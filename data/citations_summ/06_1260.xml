<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 887">As was pointed out by Branson J in Koosasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1260 at [9] and [21], it is not contentious that the relevant time for considering whether the business was 'resulting in one or more of the outcomes identified' in the definition in s.135(10) , is the date of the cancelation of the visa. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 390">The applicant also contends that the Tribunal erred in finding at [64] [44] that Gravy Clothing had not and could not satisfy any of the outcomes in s.134(10)(a) -(f) of the Migration Act . Mr Kushner submits that Gravy Clothing was engaged in the business of export, which is the outcome referred to in s.134(10)(c). Mr Kushner notes that the Tribunal did not mention the export outcome in its finding at [64]. He contends that the Tribunal was required to give specific consideration to the then currently existing and possible future export activities of the company when determining the issue of whether it was an eligible business. He relies upon Koosasi v Minister for Immigration (2006) 43 AAR 462 ; [2006] FCA 1260. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 341"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 986">Section 134(1)(a) of the Act refers to past events: it requires that the Minister be satisfied that an applicant "has not" obtained a relevant interest. However, s. 134(1)(b) refers to the present: the requirement is that the Minister be satisfied that an applicant "is" utilising her skills. It would seem to follow from s. 134(1)(b) , if not s. 134(1)(a) , that the eligible business must exist at the relevant date for the Tribunal's decision. If there is no eligible business in existence at the relevant date for the decision then an applicant could not, at that time, be exercising her skills participating in the management of that business. That approach is, in our view, consistent with that adopted by Branson J in Koosasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1260 ; (2006) 43 AAR 462 at [9] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 215">25 The applicant also relies on two decisions of the Court which considered appeals on a question of law under s 44 of the AAT Act from business visa decisions of the Tribunal, Koosasi v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1260 ; (2006) 43 AAR 462 and Yang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1159. The applicant accepts that neither decision canvassed the effect of s 483, although other aspects of the Court's jurisdiction were discussed. It is likely that the effect of that section on jurisdiction was simply not raised for consideration. In any event, there was no determination that the Court did have jurisdiction despite s 483 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] AATA 2092">Before the Tribunal can determine whether Coogee North is an eligible Australian business, the Tribunal must consider the preliminary question whether it is a business within the meaning of the Act: see Koosasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1260. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] AATA 2054">Before the Tribunal considers whether Wundowie is an eligible Australian business, the Tribunal must consider the preliminary question whether it is even a business at all within the meaning of the Act: see Koosasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1260. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] AATA 2005">Before the Tribunal considers whether Bio-Optel is an eligible Australian business, the Tribunal must consider the preliminary question whether it is a business at all within the meaning of the Act: see Koosasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1260. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] AATA 1943">Mr Poynder also referred to Koosasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1260 ; (2006) 43 AAR 462 in which Branson J held that there was lack of clarity in regard to the findings the Tribunal made regarding "substantial ownership interest" and "eligible business" and remitted the matter to the Tribunal. Mr Poynder referred to the decision of Deputy President Purvis in Koosasi v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] AATA 1311 which followed, and in which the Tribunal found for the Applicant. He submitted that the situation was similar to that of Mr Wijaya in that Deputy President Purvis held in Koosasi , that the Applicant and his wife were equal partners in a business, and held that they had a substantial ownership interest. Similarly in Koosasi , there had been only a few exports of flour, fruit and meat, and Deputy President Purvis had accepted that the business activities of the business in that case "constituted a commercial enterprise in that it was an ongoing concern engaging in export trade..." , and held that the trade was engaged in for the purpose of deriving a profit. Mr Poynder referred me to the annexures to Exhibit A1 and the statements of accounts in the T-documents. He submitted that as in Puzey v Commissioner of Taxation , Mr Wijaya and Sky Rainbow International kept financial records, acted in a business-like way, had a profit motive, and generally exhibited the badges of trade referred to in that case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] AATA 53">As the Federal Court pointed out in Koosasi V Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1260 at [23] , if the Tribunal finds that there is no business at the date of cancellation decision (in the sense of activities engaged in for the purpose of profit on a continuous and repetitive basis) [10] there is no need to give further consideration to the definition of eligible business .</sentence>
