<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] QSC 405">[25] The applicants' case encounters an abundance of authority for the proposition that where there is a contract for the sale of land to a certain purchaser "or nominee" and an entity is nominated, nevertheless the contract remains one between the vendor and the originally named purchaser: Tonelli v Komirra Pty Ltd; [4] Jenkins v Smyth; [5] Lambly v Silk Pemberton Ltd; [6] Lord v Trippe; [7] Hurrell v Townend; [8] Harry v Fidelity Nominees Pty Ltd; [9] Karangahape Road International Village Ltd v Holloway; [10] Salter v Gilbertson; [11] Commissioner of State Revenue v Politis; [12] David Deane &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Bonnyview Pty Ltd; [13] Avzur Hotels Pty Ltd v Ivanhoe Entertainment Pty Ltd; [14] CPG01 Pty Ltd v Kourinos.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSC 29">22 Rise Home contends that I should decline to follow or distinguish 428 Little Bourke Street Pty Ltd v Lonsdale Street Caf&eacute; Pty Ltd. [3] In particular, Rise Home argues that in that case the nominee was nominated merely to take a transfer or conveyance in lieu of the purchaser, rather than as an unqualified substitute purchaser. Rise Home contends that in this case the nomination was not so limited but that Rise Home was nominated to be a subsequent purchaser. Rise Home also relies on the decision of Finkelstein J in Avzur Hotels Pty Ltd v Ivanhoe Entertainment Pty Ltd. [4] Finkelstein J held that a nomination procedure provided in a contract of sale was effective to constitute the nominee a contracting party. In my opinion, the decision is merely an example of the general rule that whether or not the nomination has the effect of constituting the nominee, the identity of a contracting party is a matter of contractual construction. As Mukhtar AsJ explains in this case, the nomination clause in issue here is identical to that the subject of Judd J's decision in 428 Lt Bourke Street and there are no other factors that could found an arguable case that the nomination had the effect of constituting Rise Home a contracting party. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] VSC 555">For this second submission, reliance was placed on the decision of Finkelstein J in Avzur Hotels Pty Ltd v Ivanhoe Entertainment Pty Ltd. [22] That case concerned a nominee's standing to sue for breach of warranties in a contract for the sale of a business. As I comprehend that case, it avows the ordinary rule that when a purchaser is described as "A or his nominee", A is treated as having the power to nominate the person to whom the property purchase is to be transferred but the nominee does not become a party to the contract, much less a party with the rights and obligations of the purchaser. [23] His Honour did acknowledge that a contract may permit the purchaser to nominate a person that will stand in his place as the purchaser but, of course, under a novated contract. On the documents peculiar to the transaction in that case, the Court decided that it was "clear" that the nominee was intended to be a substitute purchaser with all rights and obligations attached to that position.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] WASC 244">55 For these reasons, the plaintiff has not shown a serious question to be tried that the third defendant was a party to the Heads of Agreement at inception. Nor is a novation alleged. Moreover, the mere fact that the Heads of Agreement contained a nominee provision does not, without more, signify that the nominee (relevantly, the third defendant) became a party to the Heads of Agreement: Avzur Hotels Pty Ltd v Ivanhoe Entertainment Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 701 ; (2009) 257 ALR 498 , [9]; Citi Nominees Pty Ltd v Fenny [2006] WASC 97 , [47] - [52].</sentence>
