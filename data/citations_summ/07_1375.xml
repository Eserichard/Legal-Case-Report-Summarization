<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VSC 594">26 The circumstances in which the present proceeding was issued in the absence of an indemnity to issue proceedings, and the circumstances in which the subsequent agreements were entered into are as set out in the reasons of Gordon J in Stewart, in the matter of Newtronics Pty Ltd. [18] It is convenient to set out those circumstances here. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1531">There has been a difference of judicial opinion as to whether it is appropriate to extend time in a case such as the present. Orders extending time were made by Warren J (as the Chief Justice then was) in Empire (Aust) Nominees Pty Ltd (in liq) v Vince [2000] VSC 324 ; (2000) 35 ACSR 167 (see [15]-[16]) and by Gordon J in Stewart, in the matter of Newtronics Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1375 (see [30]). However, in Re Read and Another [2007] FCA 1985 ; (2007) 164 FCR 237 ( Read ), French J (as the Chief Justice then was) expressed disagreement with the approach taken in those two cases. His Honour was of the opinion (at [32]-[39]) that s 1322(4)(d) of the Act could not be relied upon to extend time under s 477(2B). French J's reason was that s 477(2B) did not specify a "period for" the making of an application for approval under s 477(2B). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1359">These principles were set out in Stewart, in the matter of Newtronics Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1375 as follows (at [26]):
 
 
 (1) the court does not simply "rubber stamp" whatever is put forward by a liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1214">It is established, however, that approval may be granted nunc pro tunc : see Empire (Aust) Nominees Pty Ltd (in liq) v Vince [2000] VSC 324 ; (2000) 35 ACSR 167 ; Stewart, in the matter of Newtronics Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1375 ( Newtronics ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] WASC 235">57 The principles applicable to an application under s 477(2B) were reviewed by Gordon J in Re Newtronics Pty Ltd; Ex parte Stewart [2007] FCA 1375. The role of the court is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator's proposal. Its role is not to develop some alternative proposal which might seem preferable. Further, the task of the court is not to reconsider all of the issues which have been weighed up by the liquidator but simply to review the liquidator's proposal, paying due regard to his or her commercial judgment and knowledge of all of the circumstances of the liquidation, satisfying itself that there is no error of law or ground for suspecting bad faith or impropriety, and weighing up whether there is any good reason to intervene in terms of the expeditious and beneficial administration of the winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 629">The principles relevant to the exercise of the Court's power under this provision were summarised by Gordon J in Stewart, in the matter of Newtronics Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1375 as including the following: 
 (1) The court does not simply rubber stamp whatever is put forward by a liquidator. (2) A court will not approve an agreement if its terms are unclear. (3) The role of the court is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator's proposal. Its role is not to develop some alternative proposal which may seem preferable. (4) In reviewing the liquidator's proposal, the task of the court is --- 

 
(and her Honour quotes from Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 1381 ; (1998) 16 ACLC 1 ,642 at 1,650):
 
... not to reconsider all the issues which have been weighed up by the liquidator in developing the proposal, and to substitute its determination for his in a hearing de novo, but simply to review the liquidator's proposal paying due regard to his or her commercial judgment and knowledge of all the circumstances of the liquidation, satisfying itself there is no error of law or ground for suspecting bad faith or impropriety, and weighing up whether there is any good reason to intervene in terms of the "expeditious and beneficial administration" of the winding up. 
 (5) Generally, the court grants approval under section 477(2B) of the Act only where the transaction is a proper realisation of the assets of the company or otherwise assists in the winding up of the company.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] NSWCA 64">146 For the most part, the law concerning the duty of liquidators to collect assets by taking recovery proceedings was developed before commercial litigation funding became widely available in Australia. But courts have had occasion to consider the impact of the availability of litigation funding in various contexts, most notably in applications for judicial approval of funding agreements of more than three months' duration under s 477(2B) or s 506(1A) and in applications for judicial directions under s 479(3) or 511. Some cases that have countenanced liquidators commencing proceedings with litigation funding were listed by Palmer J (Main Judgment at [385]): Re Tosich Construction Pty Ltd (1997) 73 FCR 219 ; Re Addstone Pty Ltd (in liq) (1998) 83 FCR 583 ; Buiscex supra; Imobridge supra; Re ACN 076 673 875 Ltd supra; Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd [2003] FCA 466 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 1347 ; Leigh, re King Bros [2006] NSWSC 315 ; Stewart, re Newtronics Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1375. We would add to the list UTSA Pty Ltd (in liq) v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [1997] 1 VR 667; (1996) 21 ACSR 251 ; Re Feasty's Family Restaurant Pty Ltd (1996) 14 ACLC 1058 ; Meadow Springs Fairway Resort Ltd (in liq) v Balanced Securities Ltd [2008] FCA 471 ; (2008) 245 ALR 726 at [140] - [152], reversed on other grounds sub nom IMF (Australia) Ltd v Meadow Springs Fairway Resort Ltd (in liq) [2009] FCAFC 9. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] NSWSC 484">6 My main concern, on the last occasion, was the absence of evidence about the prospects of sale of the three properties together. Under s 477(2B) , the Court has regard to the commercial judgment of the liquidator, but "that is not to say it rubber stamps whatever is put forward by the liquidator. " ( Re Spedley Securities Ltd (in liq) (1992) 9 ACSR 83 at 85 ) In Re Spedley Securities Ltd (in liq) (1992) 9 ACSR 83 at 86, Giles J said the court will interfere where there is:
 
 
 "a lack of good faith, some error in law or principle or real and substantial grounds for doubting the prudence of the liquidator's conduct. "

Orders were also made giving approval to the plaintiff liquidators to enter into each of a number of agreements. A declaration was made under s 1322(4)(a) that none of the agreements in issue in that case was invalid by reason of having been entered into prior to obtaining the approval of the Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] NSWSC 1330">They should have approached the Court for directions under CA s.511(1)(a) as to whether they were justified in commencing the litigation in view of the terms of the proposed funding agreement with IMF, the likely return to creditors even if the proceedings were wholly successful, and the cost of the proceedings generally. Applications to the Court by liquidators for directions as to whether funded litigation should be commenced are frequent: see e.g. Movitor Pty Ltd (in liq) v Sims (1996) 64 FCR 380 ; Re Tosich Construction Pty Ltd (1997) 73 FCR 219 ; Re Addstone Pty Ltd (in liq) (1998) 83 FCR 583 ; Buiscex Ltd v Panfida Foods Ltd (in liq) (1998) 28 ACSR 357 ; Re Imobridge Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 2) [2000] 2 Qd R 280 ; Re ACN 076 673 875 Ltd (in liq) [2002] NSWSC 578 ; (2002) 42 ACSR 296 ; Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance [2003] NSWCA 71 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 1 ,347; Re AP &amp; PJ King Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] NSWSC 315 ; Stewart, re Newtronics Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1375. 386 In such applications ASIC may be given notice so that it may make its own submissions. The terms of the funding agreement are usually disclosed to the Court although not necessarily published in the judgment.</sentence>
