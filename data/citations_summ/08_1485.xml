<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 392">In these circumstances, the applicants have liberty to apply for an order that the costs in their favour be fixed in a gross sum in accordance with the Rules. 
 

 
An instance when the Court was called upon to make an order pursuant to O 62 r 4(2)(c) after an order for costs had previously been made came before Reeves J. In Mei Ying Su v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (No 2) [2008] FCA 1485 , 251 ALR 135 at 165, delivered in October 2008, His Honour made an order for costs. A subsequent application was made in December 2008 to then fix a gross sum. His Honour declined to do so: Su v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (No 3) [2008] FCA 2018.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 56">9 The background is set out by the primary judge in his reasons for judgment: Mei Ying Su v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (No 2) [2008] FCA 1485 ; (2008) 251 ALR 135 at [1] - [10]. In summary, the Mitra 2139 ('the Mitra') is a foreign fishing boat which is registered in Taiwan. The respondents were, at all relevant times, the owners of the Mitra. On 30 March 2008, the Mitra was boarded by personnel from a Royal Australian Navy patrol boat about 7 nautical miles inside the Australian Fishing Zone ('the AFZ'). If the Mitra had been used to commit any of the offences listed in s 106A of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 (Cth) ('the Fisheries Act '), the vessel, its equipment and catch were liable to be forfeited to the Commonwealth of Australia. The offence relevant to this appeal is having a foreign boat equipped for fishing in the AFZ (ss 101(1) and 101(2) of the Fisheries Act ). It is not in dispute that the elements of the offence were made out. The physical element of the offence was being in possession of or in charge of a foreign boat, so equipped, in the AFZ. 4 The question on appeal was whether the Master's mistake concerned the location of the AFZ boundary (which was said to be a mistake of law) or the location of the Mitra relative to the AFZ boundary (which was said to be a mistake of fact). At times the learned trial judge appears to have focused his attention on the location of the boundary (see Mei Ying Su v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (No 2) [2008] FCA 1485 ; (2008) 251 ALR 135 at [91] - [92]) and at other times on the location of the Mitra (see [89]) but, in my view, any doubts about the content of the trial judge's ultimate findings are resolved by reference to the context in which they were made. That context was set by his Honour's analysis of the Master's mistake in the section of his reasons for judgment that appear under that heading (at [58]-[71]). </sentence>
