<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 300">Cadbury Schweppes Pty Limited v Effem Foods Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1267 ; (2006) 69 IPR 584 (" Cadbury ") concerned an appeal against a delegate of the Commissioner of Patents who had allowed the respondent's opposition to the grant of a patent on the ground of obviousness. The applicant appealed to this court. Prior the hearing, the respondent withdrew its appearance. The Commissioner of Patents (the second respondent) appeared at the hearing but did not wish to be heard. Lindgren J noted (at [16]) that "where ... the opponent has withdrawn and the commissioner has indicated on the hearing of the appeal that she does not wish to take any active part in the proceeding, and there is no evidence before the court capable of supporting any actual or potential ground of opposition, there is no basis on which the court can uphold the opposition". His Honour then continued (at [17]): 
 
 It is important to note that in the light of the history of the application, and, in particular, the commissioner's acceptance of the application and the complete specification, s 61 of the [ Patents Act 1990 (Cth)] would have obliged the commissioner to grant the patent if there had been no opposition to the grant. In substance, that is now the position on the appeal.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 465">The making of the orders foreshadowed above will not, of course, foreclose the question of the validity of the patent in any future proceeding, such as a proceeding for revocation of the patent. Lindgren J followed Young J in European Community v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 706 ; (2006) 68 IPR 539 who in turn followed a number of other authorities all to the same effect. The propositions which Lindgren J extracted from the authorities referred to at [16] of Cadbury Schweppes [2006] FCA 1267 ; 69 IPR 584 are supported by the authorities cited by Lindgren J. In the present case, there being no opposition to the making of the orders sought by the applicant and no evidence tendered in opposition to the grant of the patent claimed in the Patent Application, the reasoning of Lindgren J in Cadbury Schweppes [2006] FCA 1267 ; 69 IPR 584 compels me to make orders substantially in the terms of the orders sought by the applicant. I see no reason not to apply his Honour's reasoning in the present case. Lindgren J followed Young J in European Community v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 706 ; (2006) 68 IPR 539 who in turn followed a number of other authorities all to the same effect. The propositions which Lindgren J extracted from the authorities referred to at [16] of Cadbury Schweppes [2006] FCA 1267 ; 69 IPR 584 are supported by the authorities cited by Lindgren J. In the present case, there being no opposition to the making of the orders sought by the applicant and no evidence tendered in opposition to the grant of the patent claimed in the Patent Application, the reasoning of Lindgren J in Cadbury Schweppes [2006] FCA 1267 ; 69 IPR 584 compels me to make orders substantially in the terms of the orders sought by the applicant. I see no reason not to apply his Honour's reasoning in the present case. It should be noted that the respondent had only succeeded before the Delegate upon the ground that the invention defined by Claims 1 to 32 of the Patent Application did not involve an inventive step. In Cadbury Schweppes Plc v Effem Foods Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1267 ; (2006) 69 IPR 584 , Lindgren J held that, in circumstances such as the present where there is an appeal from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents to refuse to grant a patent application but no-one tenders any evidence at the hearing of the appeal in support of any ground of opposition to the grant of the patent or otherwise seeks to oppose the appeal, there is no ground of opposition to the grant of the patent application that the Court can uphold. His Honour went on to hold that, in that event, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents must be set aside and that the patent should proceed to grant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 218">Ms Rubagotti for the applicant has helpfully drawn my attention to two cases each of which was concerned with an appeal under s 60(4) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) in respect of a successful opposition to a patent application. The first is a decision of Young J in European Community v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 706 ; (2006) 68 IPR 539. It was followed by Lindgren J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Limited v Effem Foods Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1267 ; (2006) 69 IPR 584. In that case Lindgren J said at para [17]: 
 
 It is important to note that in the light of the history of the application, and, in particular, the commissioner's acceptance of the application and the complete specification, s 61 of the [Patents Act 1990] would have obliged the commissioner to grant the patent if there had been no opposition to the grant. In substance, that is now the position on the appeal. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCAFC 182">20 Thirdly, the only evidence to be taken into account at the hearing of an appeal under s 60(4) will be the evidence tendered or admitted at the hearing: see Caroma Sales Pty Ltd v Philmac Pty Ltd [1972-73] ALR 427 at 428; Brickwood Holdings Pty Ltd v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [1983] VicRp 117 ; [1983] 2 VR 587 at 588-89 per King J; European Community v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 706 ; (2006) 68 IPR 539 at 543 per Young J; and Cadbury Schweppes Plc v Effem Foods Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1267 ; (2006) 69 IPR 584 at 586 per Lindgren J. This is the evidence on which the Court acts. As Kitto J said in Kaiser Aluminum at 142-43, in relation to the same kind of proceeding under the former Patents Act 1952 (Cth), the outcome of a proceeding such as this "must be decided upon the evidence adduced before [the] Court", even if a different case than that made before the Commissioner. We return to this proposition below, which is virtually decisive of the outcome of this appeal.</sentence>
