<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 27">22 Taverners submitted that paragraphs 15 and 25 of the statement of claim do comply with the relevant statutory provisions, rules and principles applicable to pleadings, particularly r 23.02 of the Rules. In so doing, it also emphasised that an application to strike out pleadings is concerned with the sufficiency of the pleadings, rather than the underlying prospects of success, and is assessed on the basis that the facts pleaded will be established at trial and that all the necessary inferences will be made in the pleading party's favour. [29] More particularly, it was submitted that Clarke v Great Southern Finance Pty Ltd [30] was concerned with an allegation of knowing involvement in a statutory contravention, a claim which the authorities made clear that the standard is actual knowledge. [31] It was said that a claim in "knowing receipt" is very different as the standard of knowledge is much lower and, relevantly, constructive knowledge suffices. [32] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 198">In relation to ground 3, the applicant submits that the credibility finding by the Tribunal was flawed in relation to the primary visa applicant's claims that he was employed as a cook and that his employment was for at least 20 hours per week. Relevantly, the applicant submits: Clearly the credibility of the husband was a matter for the Tribunal. However: a) a credibility finding must be (i) open to it on the basis of the evidence placed before it and (ii) made after consideration of matters that were logically probative of the issue of credibility: Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [1998] FCA 1126 ; (1998) 86 FCR 547 at 559; b) a credibility finding must also be 'judicial' in that it is rational, reasonable and not arbitrary: WAIJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2004) 80 ALD 468 at [19]-[22] per Lee and Tamberlin JJ; applied in SZLGP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1198 per Gordon J; c) its findings must be supported by some evidence: SZEPQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 133 ; SZCLE v Minister For Immigration [2005] FMCA 1551 at [21] - [26] per Scarlett FM; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VOAO &amp; VOAP [2005] FCAFC 50 at [5] - [13] per Wilcox, French and Finkelstein JJ; SFGB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2003) 77 ALD 402 ; [2003] FCAFC 231 at [18] - [30] per Mansfield, Selway and Bennett JJ; [8]-[10] per Tamberlin J; d) where a finding of inconsistency is based upon a misunderstanding of the Applicant's claims as put to the Tribunal, there is jurisdictional error: SZMIA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1909 at [33] - [35] per Rares J. It is submitted that the Tribunal decision fell afoul of the above principles in a number of respects. First matter The Tribunal found that there was an inconsistency between: a) the evidence of the husband's employer that the husband worked on an 'on call' basis and that he did not have fixed dates of employment or a fixed salary; and b) the husband's evidence that he worked on certain dates three days a week, was paid a fixed salary for the service and was not given payslips for his employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FMCA 777">I have taken into account that the Tribunal's consideration of relocation is on the basis of accepting the applicant's claims in relation to the incidents which he claimed had occurred (compare SZEPQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 133).</sentence>
