<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 74">An eligible judge, in deciding whether or not to issue a warrant is not acting judicially but is performing, as persona designata , an administrative function reposed in him or her by the Act. The scheme of s 130 contemplates that a trustee's application for the issue of a warrant is to be made ex parte . In my view, it is entirely in the discretion of the eligible judge whether to require notice of the application to be given to the bankrupt or any other person or to permit inspection by the bankrupt or other person of the affidavit or affidavits on which the application for the warrant is made. In many cases, the purpose of seeking the warrant would be frustrated if the bankrupt or other occupier of the subject premises were put on notice of the impending search and enabled to relocate or destroy relevant property or books. Moreover, I do not consider it open to another judge exercising the judicial power of the Court to review, or impose conditions upon, the exercise by an eligible judge of the administrative discretions conferred by s 130. In any event, in the present case, this issue has been overtaken by the judgment of Tracey J in Trollope v Middleton [2008] FCA 564 ; (2008) 169 FCR 507 which was published after argument in the instant application had been completed. </sentence>
