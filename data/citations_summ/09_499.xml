<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 510">The Court must always exercise its powers of summary disposal with caution: Spencer v The Commonwealth [2010] HCA 28 ; (2010) 241 CLR 118 (at [24]) per French CJ with whom Gummow J agreed. In determining the applicants' motion, the Court must ultimately consider whether there are any 'real', as opposed to 'fanciful', issues of fact or law that require proper determination at trial: Adnunat Pty Ltd v ITW Construction Systems Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 499 (at [37]) per Sundberg J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 448">In considering whether there is sufficient evidence available to the Court to find, on the balance probabilities, that Wilson has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding, I have had regard to the recent decision of the High Court in Spencer v Commonwealth of Australia [2010] HCA 28 ; (2010) 241 CLR 118 , where the proper construction of s 31A(2) of the Federal Court Act has been considered. As well, several recent authorities in this Court provide useful guidance on the interpretation and application of s 31A. In Helal v McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 1462 , I referred to the reasons of Kenny J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Southgate Investments Funds Limited [2010] FCA 1298 , which adopted, at [22], the observations of Sundberg J in Adnunat Pty Ltd v ITW Construction Systems Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 499 , at [37], as indicating how s 31A should be applied. In my assessment of these proceedings I have also considered the useful summary provided by Gilmour J in Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 (" Dandaven ") at [5] and [6] which was relied on by Foster J in Wang v Anying Group Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1500 , at [44]. In Dandaven, Gilmour J said: Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 307">That is, under s 31A, in order to grant summary judgment, I must be satisfied that the respondents have no reasonable prospect of success in defending the infringement claim. As s 31A(3) makes clear, this does not mean that I must be satisfied that their defence is hopeless or bound to fail. Mr White submitted that Justice Sundberg " in Adnunat Pty Ltd v ITW Construction Systems Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 499 at [37] summarised a number of principles including that the test is not to conduct a fact finding exercise but to determine whether the claim is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial (citing Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [23] per Finklestein J [74 per Rares J] 130 per Gordon J). Further, in determining whether there are reasonable prospects of success, the Court should draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non moving party and, finally, that the moving party bears the onus of persuading the court that its opponent has no reasonable prospects of success". Having regard to the authorities referred to the Court finds that the principles for summary dismissal of the application pursuant to r.13.10 are: If there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided and the rights of the parties depend on it, the matter should go to trial: Portuguese Cultural &amp; Welfare Centre (supra).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FMCA 116">It is helpful to note also the summary of principle by Sundberg J in Adnunat Pty Ltd v ITW Construction Systems Australia Pty Ltd . [35] At [37], his Honour said: [37] In applying s 31A, the court does not conduct fact finding but must assess the strength of the allegations made by reference to the pleadings, affidavits and any other evidence adduced, in order to determine whether the claim is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial: see Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [23] (Finkelstein J), [74] (Rares J) and [130] (Gordon J); see also Bradken Resources Pty Ltd v Lynx Engineering Consultants Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1257 at [28] (Emmett J); Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd [2008] FCA 1920 at [6] (Finkelstein J). Ultimately, the court must consider whether there are any real, as opposed to fanciful, issues of fact or law that require proper determination at a trial. In assessing whether there are reasonable prospects of success, the court should draw all reasonable inferences (but only reasonable inferences) in favour of the non-moving party: see Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [132] (Gordon J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] FMCA 80">I note generally that the solicitor for Crown referred to the adoption in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Southgate Investments Funds Limited [2010] FCA 1298 of the summary of the operation of s.31A of the Federal Court Act in Adnunat Pty Ltd v ITW Construction Systems Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 499 at [37] per Sundberg J. While this must now be seen in light of the approach of the High Court in Spencer (see for example Spencer at [59]), it is notable that, consistent with the approach taken to s.31A of the Federal Court Act in Adnunat , in applying such a provision the court " does not conduct fact finding , but must assess the strength of the allegations made by reference to the pleadings, affidavits and any other evidence adduced, in order to determine whether the claim is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial " (at [37]) (emphasis added). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 1462">The operation of s 31A of the Federal Court Act has been canvassed in several recent authorities in this Court. Most recently, in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Southgate Investments Funds Limited [2010] FCA 1298 , Kenny J confirmed at [22] that the following observations of Sundberg J in Adnunat Pty Ltd v ITW Construction Systems Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 499 at [37] , accurately recite how s 31A is to be applied; 
The principles governing the operation of s 31A of the Act were canvassed in detail by Lindgren J in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 ( White Industries ) and Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ( Boston ). In White Industries 160 FCR at [59], Lindgren J considered that a claim requires "real" as opposed to "fanciful" or "merely arguable" prospects in order for it to have reasonable prospects of success as required by s 31A. Justice Rares in Boston 236 ALR at [45] was of the view that, unless there are no real issues of fact --- such that "only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable" --- summary judgment (or dismissal) ought not be given pursuant to s 31A.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 1431">The power conferred by s 31A is to be exercised with caution and "is not to be exercised lightly": Spencer v The Commonwealth [2010] HCA 28 ; (2010) 241 CLR 118 at 131 (per French CJ and Gummow J) and 141 (per Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ). That need for caution is reflected in the approach to the application of s 31A adopted by judges of this Court. The principles which have emerged from their decisions were summarised by Sundberg J in Adnunat Pty Ltd (CAN 005 816 268) v ITW Construction Systems Australia Pty Ltd (CAN) 004 297 009) [2009] FCA 499 at [37] :
