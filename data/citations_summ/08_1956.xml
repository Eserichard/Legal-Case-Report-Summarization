<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 153">The Court is entitled to treat the consent of APP Singapore and Indah Kiat as involving an admission for the purposes of these proceedings of all facts necessary or appropriate to the granting of the relief sought ( ACCC v FILA Sport Oceania Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1652 ; (2007) ATPR 42-135 at [7] per Tracey J; citing Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 at 164 per Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Mason, and Wilson JJ). Notwithstanding the parties' consent, the Court must be careful to ensure that the proposed orders (including the declarations) are within power and are otherwise appropriate ( ACCC v GM Holden Ltd [2008] FCA 1428 at [11] ---[12] per Siopis J; ACCC v Grove &amp; Edgar Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1956 at [18] , [21] per Reeves J; ACCC v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79 at [1] , [20]---[21] per French J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 759">In deciding whether it is appropriate to make declarations in an ACCC instituted proceeding, the Court has looked to the public interest nature of the proceedings and the public interest role the applicant has in enforcing the Act: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Target Australia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1326 at [18] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30] and [34]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Grove and Edgar Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1956 at [20] . More specifically, the Court has observed that declarations: 
(a) are an appropriate vehicle to record the court's disapproval of the contravening conduct: Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) [1993] FCA 83 ; (1993) 41 FCR 89 at 100; 
 
(b) serve to vindicate the applicant's claim that the respondent contravened the Act: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd at [30];
 
(c) are of some assistance to the applicant in future in carrying out the duties which are conferred upon it by the Act: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd at [34];
 
(d) are of assistance in clarifying the law: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd at [34]; and
 
(e) may inform consumers of the dangers arising from a respondent's contravening conduct: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pacific Dunlop Ltd [2001] FCA 740 , at [59]-[69]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 760">In deciding whether it is appropriate to make declarations in an ACCC-instituted proceeding, the Court has looked to the public interest nature of the proceedings and the public interest role the applicant has in enforcing the Act: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Target Australia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1326 at [18] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30] and [34]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Grove and Edgar Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1956 at [20] .

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1058">On 31 August 2009 declarations of contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) were made. On the day these declarations were sought, an outline of written submissions was provided by Counsel for the Applicant. Written reasons in support of the decision to grant declaratory relief were not sought by the parties. No written reasons have thus been published in support of the relief then granted. But, when granting the declaratory relief, the Court's attention was drawn to the observations of Reeves J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Grove and Edgar Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1956 at [18] to [21] [2008] FCA 1956 ; , [2008] ATPR 42-269 at 49,818 to 49,819 and the approach that should be taken before granting such relief. Reference was also made to the summary of the authorities by Moore J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v AMV Holding Ltd [2009] FCA 605. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 605">There is a line of authority that in litigation of this type, the Court should make declarations by consent only after being satisfied that it is appropriate that the orders should be made. This line of authority was helpfully the summarised comparatively recently by Reeves J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Grove &amp; Edgar Pty Limited [2008] FCA 1956 at [18] ---[21]: 
 When the Court is asked to make declarations of right by consent it is required to scrutinise the orders sought to satisfy itself that it has the power to make those orders and to ensure, after due consideration, that they are appropriate: see ACCC v Real Estate Institute Industry of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79 at [1] and [17], ACCC v Virgin Mobile Australia Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2002] FCA 1548 at [1] and BMW Australia Limited v ACCC (2004) FCAFC 167 , (2004) 207 ALR 452 , (2004) ATPR 42-012 ( 'BMW' ) at [35]. On this aspect it should be noted that there is a long held view that a declaration, being a judicial act, should only be made on evidence and not simply on admissions or deemed admissions: see Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV Mawashi Al Gasseem (No.2) (2007) FCA 815 at [10] per Mansfield J and the cases referred to therein, particularly the observations of Kiefel J in ACCC v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1427 , (2006) 236 ALR 665.</sentence>
