<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 344">Secondly, and in any event, I can identify no error in the reasoning of the Federal Magistrate. The Federal Magistrate recorded, as was the fact, that Mr Musulin had not been trained in recognising counterfeit products. However, he accepted that consistent with the views expressed by Emmett J in Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited (in liq) v Selim [2008] FCA 416 at [30] --- [37], it was possible that special knowledge or expertise might be the subject of experience especially in the case of managers. It was on this basis that the Federal Magistrate accepted Mr Musulin's evidence. I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 584">In Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd (In liq) v Selim [2008] FCA 416 , Emmett J dealt with this matter in terms. Without setting it out, I respectfully adopt what was put by his Honour in that case at [30] - [37]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] NSWSC 1263">
 


19 The third basis of objection is, in essence, relevance. It was explained by reference to the to observations of Emmett J in Pan Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd v Selim [2008] FCA 416 concerning opinion evidence as to whether particular conduct that the expert is asked to assume satisfies or falls short of some legal standard as when a medical practitioner says that a particular procedure was conducted negligently. His Honour said at [36] and [37]:
 

 
 
 
 "[36] Very little, if any weight, should ever be accorded the last category of opinion evidence. It may be admissible by reason of the operation of s 80 , however, in so far as it is an opinion by reference to a legal standard, it will be essential, before it can be admissible and certainly before any weight can be afforded to it, that the expert's understanding of the relevant legal standard be established and be shown to be in accordance with the law. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 [37] Thus, an opinion as to whether conduct satisfies or falls short of a particular standard, such as whether particular conduct was in breach of a duty of care entails an examination as to what the expert's understanding is of the duty of care. Where the so-called opinion is proffered as to whether conduct satisfies or falls short of a statutory requirement, such as the Code, the expert must make clear just what his understanding of the effect of the Code might be. Unless the witness makes perfectly clear what he understands the Code to mean, his evidence as to whether particular conduct satisfies or falls short of it cannot be tested and can have no weight.
