<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 986">Whether there is a need to deter will depend upon the particular circumstances of the case, including whether it is easy to copy the relevant copyright work and whether it is easy to detect such infringements ( Boyapati v Rockfeller Management Corporation (No 2) [2008] FCA 1375 ; [2008] FCA 1375 ; 2008 78 IPR 600 at [22] per Kenny J). Confidential information
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 392">One instance where an exercise of the power was contemplated occurred in Boyapati v Rockefeller Management Corporation (No 2) [2008] FCA 1375 , 78 IPR 600. The respondents were there found to have infringed the applicants' copyright. The respondents' conduct was also found to be such as to warrant an order that costs be taxed and paid forthwith and that 50% of the costs were to be paid on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 633">Next, the Act prescribes the manner and order in which a Court is to assess damages under ss 115 and 116 of the Act. The question posed by s 116(1C) cannot be addressed until damages have been assessed under s 115: Boyapati v Rockefeller Management Corporation (No 2) [2008] FCA 1375 ; (2008) 78 IPR 600 at [15] . Conversion damages under s 116 of the Act are in addition to relief under s 115 of the Act, not the other way round: s 116(1B) of the Act. If the relief the Court has granted or proposes to grant under s 115 is sufficient, no additional award is made under s 116 of the Act: s 116(1C) of the Act. Finally, there should be no overlap between the damages awarded under ss 115 and 116 of the Act: International Writing Institute Inc v Rimila Pty Ltd (1995) 57 FCR 135 and Sutherland Publishing Company [1936] Ch 323 , 340-341 (per Romer LJ) and 342-343 (per Greene LJ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1621">27 In this circumstance, the Commissioner should have his costs thrown away by reason of the adjournment of the trial, including the hearings on 5 and 18 September 2008. The next question is whether these costs should be paid on an indemnity basis. The usual rule is that costs are payable on a party and party basis, unless the circumstances of the case warrant a departure from the normal course: see Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 (" Colgate-Palmolive ") at 233 per Sheppard J; Re Wilcox: Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 at 152-53 per Black CJ and 156-58 per Cooper and Merkel JJ; and O 62 of the Rules. It is unnecessary to outline in detail the principles governing when a departure from the usual rule is justified: see, for example, Boyapati v Rockefeller Management Corporation (No 2) [2008] FCA 1375 (" Boyapati (No 2 )") and the authorities therein. As the Full Court said in Hamod v New South Wales (2002) 188 ALR 659 at 665 (per Gray J, with whom Carr and Goldberg JJ agreed), indemnity costs "serve the purpose of compensating a party fully for costs incurred, as a normal costs order could not be expected to do, when the Court takes the view that it was unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the expenditure of costs".</sentence>
