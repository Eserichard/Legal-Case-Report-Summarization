<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1420">It is clear enough, at least by a series of first instance decisions, that documents which are discovered may not be masked to exclude material which the discovering party claims to be irrelevant, and that the whole of the discovered document must be produced for inspection. See generally Sportsbet Pty Ltd v State of New South Wales (No 4) [2009] FCA 1509 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 353 at [12] - [13] per Selway J; Sunland Waterfront (BVI) Ltd v Prudentia Investments Pty Ltd (No 4) [2010] FCA 863 at [95] to [101] per Logan J; Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2009] FCA 12 ; [2009] 253 ALR 354. I do not think the last mentioned case, having regard to the agreed arrangements about categories of discoverable documents, reflects any different view. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 863">This conclusion differs from that reached by Besanko J in Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2009] FCA 12 ; [2009] FCA 12 ; (2009) 253 ALR 354. His Honour discerned a different outcome in relation to the permissibility of unilateral redaction for relevance depending on whether there was an order for general or limited discovery with the practice being permissible where the order was for general discovery and the affidavit verifying the list then having the usual, prima facie effect. As his Honour expressly acknowledged (at [26]) that conclusion was directly at odds with observations made by Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 353 ; [2004] ATPR 41-996 which observations had been referred to with approval in a general way in a number of later authorities. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 671">The respondents accepted that, in compliance with the obligation to give general discovery, a party may (eg by sealing up, masking or redacting) discover only those parts of a particular document which are considered to be relevant: GE Capital Corporate Finance Group Ltd v Bankers Trust Co [1995] 1 WLR 172 , 174. As was made clear in that case, a party's oath on the matter of relevance is conclusive, and no less so in a case where the discoverability of parts of a document is contentious than in a case where the discoverability of a document as a whole is contentious. However, it was argued on behalf of the respondents that the order made by the court on 19 April 2010, at least to the extent that it required discovery of the categories of documents specified in the schedule thereto, did not merely establish the applicants' obligation to give general discovery. Rather, it was what has been described as an order for "specific discovery", made under O 15 r 8, and foreclosed any question of relevance. Relevance was assumed by the making of the order, the applicants' only further obligation being to discover the documents if they existed, and were within their possession, custody or power. In these respects, the respondents relied upon the judgment of Besanko J in Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2009] FCA 12 ; (2009) 253 ALR 354 , 358-361. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 36">The applicant contends that he is entitled to undertake the redaction of irrelevant materials in documents provided for inspection and referred to such authorities as Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) (2009) 253 ALR 354 ; [2009] FCA 12 ; Bailey v Department of Land and Water Conservation [2009] NSWCA 100 at [100] ; Areva NC (Australia) Pty Ltd v Summit Resources (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] WASC 67. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1509">There is a degree of uncertainty in this Court about the extent to which masking for relevance in discovery is or is not permissible. The debate is usefully collected in Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2009] FCA 12 at [12] --- [26] by Besanko J. Putting the matter somewhat loosely, it would appear that masking for relevance is not permitted where specific discovery has been ordered but may be permissible where general discovery has been ordered; although this latter proposition may be controversial. Discovery in this case has not been general discovery but rather specific, so that it follows, as Sportsbet correctly submits, that the original categories do require the production of unmasked copies. It follows that the twelfth category is not to be seen as fresh discovery but rather as further discovery. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 546">In considering the formulation of categories of documents for the purposes of discovery, two matters are important. First, it is trite to say that the categories will be formulated having regard to the issues between the parties as revealed in the pleadings. Secondly, the criteria in O 15 r 2(3) generally provide an appropriate guide to the formulation of appropriate categories. The categories can be formulated by reference to O 15 r 2(3) without specific reference to that rule, or O 15 r 2(3) can be incorporated into the categories as a limiting factor: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 366 at [17] - [23] per Lindgren J; Aveling v UBS Capital Markets Australia Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 415 at [9]- [11] per Lindgren J; Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2009] FCA 12 ; (2009) 253 ALR 354 at 360 [21] - [22] . It seems to me, however, that the Court retains a general power to fashion an order for discovery which is appropriate to the circumstances of the case. Although it is perhaps most unlikely, it is within the Court's power to make an order for discovery in accordance with the "train of inquiry" test (see The Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano Co (1882) 11 QBD 55 at 63; see also O 15 r 8, which uses the expression, "any document relating to any matter in question in the proceeding"). The issues on the notice of motion
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] NSWCA 100">94 The appellants did, however, maintain that his Honour was in error in failing to find that the respondents had waived privilege with respect to the redacted portion of Exhibit 8. Essentially, the appellants advanced four propositions in support of that submission. The first, based on the decision of Besanko J in Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2009] FCA 12 at [16] ---[18], maintained that it was not open to the respondents to mask the redacted part of Exhibit 8 without the consent of the appellants or the leave of the Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] WASC 67">21 However, most recently, in Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2009] FCA 12 , Besanko J drew a distinction between a case in which an order for general discovery (in the Peruvian Guano sense) had been made, and a case in which a more limited order had been made - for example, by reference to specific classes of documents. In his view, in the former case, the more traditional approach enunciated in G E Capital Corporate Finance Group Ltd should be followed, whereas in the latter class of case, the approach enunciated by the more recent decisions of the Federal Court should be followed. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will be embraced by other members of the Federal Court.
