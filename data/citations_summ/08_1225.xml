<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1061">The applicant referred to the decision of Gyles J in Delnorth Pty Ltd (ACN 051 954 977) v Dura-Post (Aust) Pty Ltd (ACN 101 287 512) [2008] FCA 1225 ; (2008) 78 IPR 463. One issue in that case was whether information about a roadside post had been made publicly available by the doing of an act. In the course of his reasons, Gyles J said (480-481 [73]): 
 
 
 "The present case is not like Jupiters , where the system was operating in what amounted to a public place and could be observed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 723">In determining the issue of innovative step, the Full Court in Dura-Post Pty Ltd v Delnorth Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 81 said, at [54], that, inter alia, the Court is obliged to ask, in accordance with s 7(4) whether the invention, so far as is claimed in any claim, only varies from the kinds of information in s 7(5) in ways that make no substantial contribution to the working of the invention. The Full Court said, at [79], that the test of innovative step involves a "modified novelty test", which is derived from Griffin v Isaacs (1938) 1B IPR 619 ; (1938) 12 ALG 169. The modified novelty test involves a number of steps in a factual inquiry described by the judge at first instance, Gyles J, in Delnorth Pty Ltd v Dura-Post Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1225. The approach of Gyles J was upheld by the Full Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 668">On 13 August 2008 Gyles J delivered judgment ( Delnorth v Dura-Post (Aust) Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1225; (2008) 78 IPR 463). His Honour found that Dura-Post had infringed some of the claims of each of the innovation patents by, amongst other things, making and supplying certain flexible steel roadside posts. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 108">The Parent Priority Documents do not contain a real and reasonably clear disclosure of any way by which the labelled reagent may bind in the detection zone other than by use of a specific binding reagent for the analyte immobilised in the detection zone ( Synthetic Turf at [28]---[29]). Unlike in Delnorth Pty Limited v Dura Post (Aust) Pty Limited [2008] FCA 1225 ; (2008) 78 IPR 463 , the method by which the labelled reagent binds to the detection zone is fundamental to the operation of the invention. The first sentence in all three priority documents states that the invention relates to "assays involving specific binding". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCAFC 81">68 The primary judge rejected Dura-Post's argument as to the construction and application of s 7(4), saying (in Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [52] - [54]) that:
 There is no need to search for some particular advance in the art to be described as an innovative step which governs the consideration of each claim. The first step is to compare the invention as claimed in each claim with the prior art base and determine the difference or differences. The next step is to look at those differences through the eyes of a person skilled in the relevant art in the light of common general knowledge as it existed in Australia before the priority date of the relevant claim and ask whether the invention as claimed only varies from the kinds of information set out in s 7(5) in ways that make no substantial contribution to the working of the invention. 39 In concluding that the device disclosed by Pellowski was a device attached to, on, or in the surface of the roadway, his Honour said:
 At first sight the reference to 'shoulders of the roadway' may indicate to the contrary, particularly as the same description is used in the patents in suit for the location of the roadside post. So far as the former is concerned, figure 4 and the commentary upon it show the marking devices said to be on the shoulders as within the bounds of the roadway and claim 1 is quite explicit in claiming a means for securing and supporting 'one end of the strip in the roadway'. [Emphasis added by the primary judge] By contrast, the patents in suit use 'shoulder' in the sense of one of the meanings in The Macquarie Dictionary (3rd edn, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 1998), namely, 'either of two strips of land bordering a road, especially that part on which the vehicles can be parked in an emergency'. The description 'roadside' posts taken with the examples given is itself sufficient to indicate the posts are not designed for use on the roadway. See Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [40] - [41]. Having ourselves examined the Pellowski Patent and the Patents in suit, we agree with his Honour's observations and conclusions as stated above.  78 The 1995 ACIP report (at [63] above) recommended that the test for innovation patents should be a modified form of the novelty test in Griffin v Isaacs (1938) 1B IPR 619 ; 12 ALJ 169. This was apparently accepted in the Government Response , although with some changes in language. It suffices to refer to the primary judge's helpful discussion of Griffin v Isaacs : see Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [57] - [59] and to draw attention to Dixon J's observation (at 624) that:
 Where variations from a device previously published consist in matters which make no substantial contribution to the working of the thing ... and the merit if any of the two things, considered as inventions, is the same, it is, I think, impossible to treat the differences as giving novelty. Plainly enough, the legislature drew on the language of Dixon J in framing the test of "no substantial contribution to the working of the invention" in s 7(4). The Revised Explanatory Memorandum does not lead to a different conclusion. In referring to the working of the "thing", Dixon J had in mind the waistband on a pair of trousers that was the subject of the applicant's patent application. The drafter of s 7(4) has picked up Dixon J's language and substituted for the word "thing", the word "invention" --- the latter covering not only a claimed device but also a claimed process.  The invention as claimed has a body "formed" of sheet spring steel, as opposed to being mechanically laminated or constructed from layers of sheet spring steel. This is confirmed by the balance of the specification: compare Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 220 ; (2005) 67 IPR 230 at 236-237 [44] per Wilcox, Branson and Bennett JJ. As his Honour noted (in Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [32] ):
 [T]he summary of the invention says: 'The sheet spring steel has a thickness of 0.9 mm to 1.5 mm'... The description of the preferred embodiments includes (in dealing with figure 2(a)), 'The sheet spring steel from which the body ... is formed has a thickness of 1.2 mm ... Other variations of the body will generally have ... sheet thickness of 0.9 to 1.5mm'. In dealing with figure 2(b) it is said 'The transverse width and sheet thickness are the same as the embodiment of Fig 2a'. 17 We note that the primary judge ruled on the meaning of integer (8) in the claims --- being the words "elastically bendable through 90 degrees from an unbent state about said transverse axis" and that this ruling was unchallenged on the appeal. In particular, his Honour held that these words: 
 ... describe the article by reference to its physical features and characteristics as such, not by reference to any particular situation or location [as Dura-Post argued]. In other words, the material must have the capacity to be elastically bendable in the manner described. The phrase is not a means of limiting the claim by result, rather it deals with the choice of material --- spring steel with the described characteristics of elastic bendability. His Honour also held that "[t]he necessary degree of flexibility was established": see Delnorth Pty Ltd v Dura-Post (Aust) Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1225 at [14] - [15].  36 The primary judge held that the device disclosed in the Pellowski Patent was attached to, on, or in the surface of the roadway, whereas the invention as claimed in all relevant claims related to a post in the ground adjacent to the roadway: see Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [39] . 41 The primary judge held that the Kennedy Patent disclosed "a flexible support with a plurality of thin sheets of material laminated together and, further, that the multiple laminations played a role in utility going beyond mere dimensions": see Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [30] . In contrast with the Kennedy Patent, the Patents in suit disclosed "a homogenous body rather than one with multiple layers or laminations": see Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [32] . 41 The primary judge held that the Kennedy Patent disclosed "a flexible support with a plurality of thin sheets of material laminated together and, further, that the multiple laminations played a role in utility going beyond mere dimensions": see Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [30] . In contrast with the Kennedy Patent, the Patents in suit disclosed "a homogenous body rather than one with multiple layers or laminations": see Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [32] . 29 The primary judge rejected Dura-Post's argument on lack of manner of manufacture. His Honour said, in Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [25] :
 There would be much to be said for the argument if the invention were a claim for making a roadside post out of sheet spring steel. However, the matter must be judged claim by claim in accordance with the wording of s 18(1A). No claim is as broad as that considered in Microcell [1959] HCA 71 ; 102 CLR 232. Each involves a form of article with features additional to the material of spring sheet steel. It cannot be concluded that there is no 'new' manner of manufacture from the face of the specification. This ground of invalidity fails.  70 The primary judge continued with a discussion of Griffin v Isaacs (1938) 1B IPR 619 ; 12 ALJ 16 , observing, amongst other things, that "[t]he reference [presumably in the 1995 ACIP report and the Government Response ] to what was said in Griffin ... is somewhat confusing": see Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [57] . After referring to other judicial discussion of Griffin v Isaacs , his Honour said, in Delnorth at [59]-[61]:
 These discussions indicate that a wider view of lack of novelty was taken in the High Court prior to the Patents Act 1952 (Cth) than could properly be taken thereafter, at least in relation to appeals from the Commissioner. Be that as it may, the feature of what Dixon J said was the disjunctive nature of the concepts --- one was 'make no substantial contribution to the working of the thing'; the other was 'involve no ingenuity or inventive step'. The first alternative has been taken by Parliament virtually verbatim from the judgment. The focus is upon working of the invention (as claimed) not to the degree or kind of variation from the kinds of information set out in s 7(5). In other words, the variation from the kinds of information might be slight but, if a substantial contribution is made to the working of the invention, then there is an innovative step. ... In my view the provenance of the phrase 'make no substantial contribution to the working of the invention' indicates that 'substantial' in this context means 'real' or 'of substance' as contrasted with distinctions without a real difference.  32 Dura-Post's argument is not made out on the face of the specification. We accept that, as Delnorth said, "[t]he specification does not admit that the invention is nothing but a new use of spring steel for a purpose for which its properties made it suitable; nor does it support the drawing of any inference to that effect". In the specification, there is no reference to features of the claims, such as barbs, marker holes, tapered ends, as forming part of the group of known roadside posts. There is, furthermore, the unchallenged finding of the primary judge, in Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [62] , that "use of sheet spring steel was not known for use in connection with roadside posts or analogous uses " (emphasis added), a finding that makes reliance on a Microcell objection very difficult to sustain: compare Merck 154 FCR at 52-53 discussing Morgan &amp; Co v Windover &amp; Co (1890) 7 RPC 131.  69 At this point in his reasons, the primary judge referred to the passages from the 1995 ACIP report set out at [63] above, as well as to the Government's Response : see [66] above. His Honour noted, however, that, in this Response , the "government ... agreed 'in principle' that the test be a modified form of the novelty test" set out in Griffin v Isaacs (1938) 1B IPR 619 ; 12 ALJ 16 , "although there were ultimately significant differences between the wording of s 7(4) and that proposed by ACIP": see Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [56] . 87 In his reasons, in Delnorth [2008] FCA 1225 at [30] , the primary judge held that the Kennedy Patent disclosed "a flexible support with a plurality of thin sheets of material laminated together and, further, that the multiple laminations played a role in utility going beyond mere dimensions". On the appeal, Dura-Post accepted that Kennedy disclosed a flexible support consisting of the mechanical laminations of a number of flexible members. For the reasons already stated, we accept that the primary judge was correct to construe the claims of Patents 1 and 2 as being limited to a homogenous body of sheet spring steel as opposed to multiple layers of spring steel mechanically laminated together. Further, there was evidence (given by Mr Dowling) that the use of a single sheet:
 
&#8226; affected the bending characteristics of the roadside post;
 
&#8226; avoided corrosion between multiple layers that could impact on bending characteristics;
 
&#8226; avoided the need for clamping components that could impact on bending characteristics;
 
&#8226; allowed a surface coating to be applied without risking damage by friction between layers; and
 
&#8226; allowed for pre-determined flexibility characteristics to be adopted without them being affected on installation or maintenance. Most of these aspects of Mr Dowling's evidence was confirmed by Mr Rootes. In this circumstance, there is no relevant error shown in his Honour's conclusion with regard to the Kennedy Patent.</sentence>
