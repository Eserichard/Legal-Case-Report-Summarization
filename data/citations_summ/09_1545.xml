<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 327">Plastec Australia pleads that the first 9 September email was sent to a class of persons engaged in either plumbing inspection activities or the administration of compliance with applicable codes relating to plumbing work, employed within a number of local government authorities including the Brisbane City Council and other Councils whose areas of authority include the Lockyer Valley, Fraser Coast, Ipswich, Southern Downs, Moreton Bay, Cairns, Toowoomba, Bundaberg and South Burnett. Whether conduct, in this case distributing the first 9 September email, contains a representation is a question of fact to be decided by considering what was said against the background of all the surrounding circumstances: Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd [1982] FCA 136 ; (1982) 42 ALR 177. Although the circumstances of the conduct in Butcher v Lachlan Realty Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 is quite different, the High Court emphasises at [39] per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ that everything relevant must be taken into account as a whole. The test is whether an ordinary or reasonable person from the class of persons to whom the representation is made is likely to be misled or deceived. The test is an objective one for the Court to determine itself upon the whole of the evidence: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 ; Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at [103] --- [105]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster [2009] FCA 682 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Dreamtime Creations Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1545 ; (2010) 263 ALR 487 per Mansfield J at [14] to [16]. </sentence>
