14 The nature of the relevant balancing was recently referred to by French J in National Institute for Truth Verification v Computer Voice Stress Analyser Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 736 at [16] :
 
 
 
 
 "Orders requiring the provision of security for costs involve a balancing of the legitimate interests of the applicant, to pursue its claimed entitlement to remedies against wrongs allegedly done to it and the legitimate interests of the respondents that they not be exposed to irrecoverable loss by reason of proceedings which cause them to incur substantial expense but are ultimately unsuccessful against them. It is because the award of security involves a balancing of contending legitimate interests that the amount of the security to be provided is generally not the full amount of estimated costs.
