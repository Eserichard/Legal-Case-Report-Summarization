<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 956">Yates Property was one of a number of cases mentioned by the Full Court in what is the most recent statement as to the approach which should be taken when indemnity costs are sought upon the ground that an applicant's case is conspicuously weak, Seven Network Ltd v News Limited [2009] FCAFC 166 ; (2009) 262 ALR 160 , 393 [1102]: 
 
 Usually costs are ordered on a party and party basis but if there is "some special or unusual feature in the case to justify the court exercising its discretion" costs may be ordered on some other basis: Preston v Preston [1982] 1 All ER 41 at 58. There must, however, be some justification to depart from the ordinary rule. The discretion to depart from an order for party and party costs will not be exercised unless there is some special or unusual feature or the justice of the case so requires: Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (1996) 72 FCR 151 ; 141 ALR 727. The categories of case in which it might be appropriate to do so are not closed: Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 ; 118 ALR 248 ( Colgate-Palmolive ). An applicant who should have known that his or her proceeding was foredoomed to failure could be obliged to pay costs on an indemnity basis: Smolle v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1967. A clearly hopeless proceeding may mean that the unsuccessful applicant should be subjected to an order for indemnity costs. An applicant who persists in prosecuting a proceeding without regard to the evidentiary difficulties in the case may be called upon to pay costs on some basis other than the usual basis: Yates Property Corporation Pty Ltd v Boland (No 2) [1997] FCA 760 ; (1997) 147 ALR 685. Specific examples of cases which might attract the exercise of the discretion to award indemnity costs were given by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive at FCR 233; ALR 256 ---7.
