<citphrase id="cp8.24" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 164">summary dismissal</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp8.25" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 164">federal court rules , o. 10, r. 4; o. 20, r. 2. held: (1) a breach of a condition which was implied by the trade practices act 1974 s. 71 does not involve conduct in contravention of the provisions of pt v of the act, because: (i) the breach was not conduct in supplying goods, but in the want of correspondence between the state of the goods supplied and the quality referred to in s.71 ; and (ii) s. 71 imposes an obligation upon one of the contracting parties as though the parties had embodied the obligation in the contract.  for the purposes of the act s.82 , a breach of the obligation imposed by s.71 was not a breach of an obligation imposed by the act but was a breach of an obligation imposed by the contract itself. thus proceedings for damages resulting from a breach of a s.71 condition, were not proceedings falling within s.82 and did not constitute a matter in which s.86 conferred jurisdiction on the federal court.  (2) section 74d of the act implied only a condition where the manufacturer supplied the goods to another person who acquired the goods for re-supply, it did not relate to an agreement between the manufacturer and consumer. further, the federal court does not have jurisdiction to grant relief in a claim arising solely pursuant to s.74d.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWSC 1335">26 Secondly, even if a contractual basis was established that would not mean a cause of action was necessarily available to a person in the position of Mr Chan. Disputes between students and establishments of learning are ordinarily unsuitable for adjudication in the courts and ought to be resolved by internal procedures: Clark v University of Lincolnshire and Cumberside [2000] 1 WLR 1988 at [12] and [30] - [31], seemingly approved in Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 at [58] and [165]; and see also Walsh v University of Technology, Sydney [2007] FCA 880 at [71] - [80].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1288">5 I have also had regard to the detailed judgment delivered in the proceedings previously brought by Mr Walsh where Buchanan J examined a statement of claim in relation to similar facts, albeit based on different causes of action, and ordered that it be struck out and the proceedings dismissed (see Walsh v University of Technology, Sydney [2007] FCA 880).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1308">10 The way his Honour approached the task was to examine Mr Walsh's very lengthy statement of claim and the complaints made in it. In that examination his Honour identified that, in substance, what Mr Walsh complained of was a failure of the university properly to assess his work as having satisfied its requirements for a pass in each of the three assignments, the subject and the ultimate degree. His Honour said that Mr Walsh's claim raised questions of academic assessment and judgment ([2007] FCA 880 at [77]).  3 Mr Walsh has sought an extension of time in which to file an application for leave to appeal against the decision of Buchanan J in Walsh v University of Technology Sydney [2007] FCA 880. His Honour dismissed the proceedings pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) after having struck out Mr Walsh's statement of claim. 12 At the heart of this dispute there lay, in my opinion, as identified by his Honour, a deeper question. His Honour reviewed the principles which the courts have developed in cases where students seek to contest the way in which academic institutions assess their academic merit. Buchanan J said that he expressed directly to Mr Walsh during the oral submissions at the hearing his reservations about the power of the Court to grant any remedy of the kind Mr Walsh sought. He noted that Mr Walsh was not able to draw to his Honour's attention any statutory provision, authority or legal principle which might provide a foundation or starting point for the proposition that the court could direct a university as to its course content or requirements or require it to award him passing grades in either individual assignments or a whole subject. Mr Walsh acknowledged that he had been unable to find any case of this kind and agreed that he was asking the court to strike out to new legal territory ([2007] FCA 880 at [71]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1042">On 15 June 2007 I ordered that Mr Walsh's statement of claim and application be, respectively, struck out and dismissed ( Walsh v University of Technology, Sydney [2007] FCA 880).</sentence>
