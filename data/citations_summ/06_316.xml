<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 313">In this case the explanation for the delay is not one that I can accept as being satisfactory. I note relevant authorities for the proposition that seeking Ministerial intervention carries with it a contrary intention to seeking judicial review.

That was a decision of Wilcox J, in which the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court was overturned. In that case, the Federal Magistrate had considered that the making of a s.351 application was an indication that the applicant had abandoned any right he may have had to judicial review in this court. Wilcox J examined some of the authorities, including the matter of S58 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 283 ; (2004) 85 ALD 492 . In S58 of 2003 , Madgwick J said that even if the applicant has a good case on its merits for constitutional relief, and notwithstanding the possible importance of the case to him, to sanction such a long and poorly explained delay would be quite wrong. In S58 of 2003 , the delay was five years, and, as his Honour noted, the delay was poorly explained. </sentence>

11 Additionally, the Federal Magistrate referred to Wilcox J's consideration in Gararth v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 316 ; (2006) 91 ALD 790 of the judgment of Madgwick J in S58 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 451. In S58 of 2003 relief was declined on discretionary grounds because of the applicant's unexplained delay of five years. In Gararth at [62] Wilcox J observed:

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 46">In Gararth v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 316 at [62] , Wilcox J made the following observation in respect of delay: 62. Nonetheless, constitutional relief is a discretionary remedy. There is ample authority for the proposition that excessive, unexplained delay will justify a court in refusing constitutional relief, even to an applicant who has otherwise made out a good case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FMCA 1420">At [57] his Honour said: 
 
 
 "In my own reasons in Aala I indicated that the 'public character of the legal duties' which the remedies were designed to uphold meant that 'ordinarily, [relief] will issue where the preconditions are made out". I went on to acknowledge: 
 
 
 
 
 
 "But circumstances will occasionally arise where it is appropriate to withhold the writ because a party has been slow to assert its rights, has been shown to have waived those rights, or seeks relief in trivial circumstances or for collateral motives, and where the issue of the writs would involve disproportionate inconvenience and injustice. "" 
 
 
 
 
 The question of delay in a migration case was considered indirectly by Wilcox J in Garrath v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 316. His Honour first considered the decision of Madgwick J in S58/2003 v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCA 451 in relation to which he said at [59]: 
 
 
 " S58 was a migration case. At [21], Madgwick J said:

I further note that there are some decisions of this Court, (including two which the applicant has relied upon): NAGG , SZHEH at [36]-[41] and SZEEF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 661 (relying on Gararth v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 316) where the explanation of pursuing a "s.417 request" was found to be acceptable in explaining delay. 83. While each of the circumstances in each of those cases can, in my view, be distinguished from the circumstances before the Court now, to the extent that these cases appear to take a different view to what was set out in M211 of 2003 , with respect, I take the view that M211 of 2003 is binding on this Court and plainly should be followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FMCA 913">I further note that there are some decisions of this Court: NAGG of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 84 , SZEEF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 661 (relying on Gararth v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 316) and SZHEH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 1301 at [36] - [41], where the explanation of pursuing a " s.417 request" was found to be acceptable in explaining delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FMCA 582">A more recent decision of Wilcox J in Gararth v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 316 considered that the seeking of a discretionary decision from a Minister did provide a sufficient explanation for a "delay of two years in seeking constitutional relief" .</sentence>

 3. The first issue to be decided is whether the decision under review is a "privative clause decision". The test of whether the decision is a privative clause decision within s.474 of the Migration Act 1958 is whether it is free from jurisdictional error. If no jurisdictional error occurred in its making, it is a privative clause decision. If it is a privative clause decision it cannot be challenged (s.474 --- inserted 2 October 2001). If it is not a privative clause decision, the statutory time limit for challenging it does not apply: S157/2002 211 CLR 476 at [87], Gararth v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 2006 FCA 316 para 61.

 (2) the legislative intent expressed by s.477 of the Migration Act , 1958 (Cth) prescribing a time limit which the Applicant has not complied with; and
