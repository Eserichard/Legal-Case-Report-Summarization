It is exercised only in circumstances where it is necessary to do so in the interests of justice.

The Court also has an implied or inherent jurisdiction to restrict publication: see John Fairfax &amp; Sons Limited v Police Tribunal of New South Wales (1986) 5 NSWLR 465 at 476E-477A per McHugh JA, Glass JA agreeing at 467; Grassby v The Queen [1989] HCA 45 ; [1989] HCA 45 ; (1989) 168 CLR 1 at 16-17 per Dawson J with whom Mason CJ, Brennan J and Toohey J agreed; see too The Food Improvers Pty Ltd v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1394 ; (2006) 155 FCR 216 at 220-223 [18] - [29], [32] where I discussed the applicable principles.</sentence>
