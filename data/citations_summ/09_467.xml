<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1160">The events which are pleaded, as observed in Sartori v BM2008 Pty Ltd (ACN 005 762 685) [2009] FCA 467 ( Sartori No 1 ), pertain to circumstances originating so long ago that certain key participants in the events are no longer alive. The first alleged breach took place in 1981. Mr Sartori says that the Company, without notice to him and without first giving any notice in accordance with the requirements of reg 41, on or about 17 July 1981 or in the period shortly after, purported to resolve to issue and issued 12,000 B class shares in the Company. That issue, according to Mr Sartori, was void because the Company and its board failed to offer the shares to Mr Sartori and in every other respect failed to comply with the requirements of reg 41; was contrary to the interests of the members of the Company as a whole and was oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly discriminatory against the other shareholders of the Company. It reduced the proportionate entitlement of other shareholders to payment of the dividend or to return of capital in the event of a winding up and deprived shareholders of the right to accept an offer of and to receive additional shares pursuant to reg 41. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1131">The parties' submissions directed my attention to both the expressed terms of considerations raised by r.8.01, and also general discretionary considerations in relation to matters of change of venue, for example, by reference to the recent discussion of McKerracher J in Sartori v BM2008 Pty Ltd (ACN 005 762 685) [2009] FCA 467 at [11] , and the judgment of Barnes FM in Lolliland Pty Ltd v Dollar Sweets Company Pty Ltd [2009] FMCA 257. I do not propose to repeat their discussion, but have taken into account all the matters that they identify when considering the issue of venue. I shall return to that issue, after addressing other issues which might affect my consideration of it. </sentence>
