<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 419">Previous judgments in relation to interlocutory applications have recounted the history of the proceedings: Smart Company Pty Ltd v Clipsal Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1008 ; (2008) 249 ALR 388 ; Smart Company Pty Ltd v Clipsal Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1253 ; Smart Company Pty Ltd v Clipsal Australia Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 4. What follows is a summary of that history.  It filed a second notice on 9 November 2009 and a third notice on 10 November 2009. Mr Stephen McNamara who was the solicitor who had the care and conduct of the matter said in an affidavit sworn on 27 April 2010 that at the time of filing the Notice of Acting he was instructed that: 
 
 31.1 Mr Seeger Snowden, a technical expert had been retained in July 2009 and that a set of assumptions settled by senior counsel had been provided to the expert; 
 

 
 
 31.2 financial experts Sothertons Chartered Accountants had been retained; 
 

 
 
 31.3 lay witness statements had been drafted and the major witness statements had been settled by counsel; 
 

 
 
 31.4 senior counsel was available to conduct the trial which had been set down to commence on the 31 st May 2010; and 
 

 
 
 31.5 the hard copy file was not available as it was being retained by Smart's former solicitors in this matter but that all documents, pleadings and other matters the subject of the claim were available electronically. 
 

 On 9 November 2009 the respondents' application for further security for costs was dismissed and the respondents were ordered to pay the applicant's costs of the application: Smart Company Pty Ltd v Clipsal Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1253. On the same day the following orders were made: The proceeding be set down for trial on all issues on 31 May 2010 with an estimated duration of 12 weeks. The applicant file and serve its expert evidence in relation to the assumptions provided to the respondents under cover of letter dated 4 June 2009 by Friday, 4 December 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1222">The nature of the threshold (or jurisdictional) requirement was considered by von Doussa J in Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson [1992] FCA 110 ; (1992) 7 ACSR 203 at 205. His Honour said the power in s 1335(1) was triggered where there was reason to believe there was "a real chance that in events which can be fairly described as reasonably possible" the applicant company will be unable to pay the respondent's costs. Whether his Honour's reformulation of the statutory test would lead to any different result, in my view the statutory test is clear and may be readily applied in its own terms.
