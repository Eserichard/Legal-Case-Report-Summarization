 Introduction 
 The plaintiff, South Australia Water Corporation ("SA Water") took out a summons and filed its statement of claim on 31 August 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1480">I was referred to a number of authorities, but I do not need to go through them in detail. The general principles are well known. They are summarised by Branson J in Reading Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Mutual Provident Society (1999) 217 ALR 495 ; [1999] FCA 718 at [6] - [9]. They were applied by Kenny J in Fleming's Nurseries Pty Ltd v Hannaford [2008] FCA 591. Orders separating liability from damages or an account of profits are often made in intellectual property cases. In Liberty Financial Pty Ltd v Scott [2003] FCA 226 at [40] , Weinberg J expressed the view that intellectual property cases, or at least intellectual property cases other than patent cases, should be treated no differently from other commercial cases. I do not need to enter that debate because this is not an intellectual property case. The claims made by the applicant include claims made under the Corporations Act and the TPA. In any event, there is no fixed and invariable rule that an order for the determination of separate questions will be made in intellectual property cases. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 884">I have previously discussed the parties' claims and responses in Fleming's Nurseries Pty Ltd v Tony Hannaford [2008] FCA 591 at [4] - [10]. It is unnecessary to repeat this discussion. Mr Hannaford filed a Further Amended Defence and Second Further Amended Cross-claim on 6 April 2009. My attention was drawn to the admission contained in paragraph [36.2]. </sentence>
