<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] RRTA 389">As the applicant in this case claims to be stateless, in this context, "nationality" refers to "citizenship" (UNHCR Handbook, at [87]; see also VSAB v MIMIA [2006] FCA 239 (Weinberg J, 17 March 2006) at [50]-[53]) and the word "country" in "country of nationality" denotes a country capable of granting nationality ( Koe v MIEA &amp; Ors (1997) 78 FCR 289). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] RRTA 530">In this context, "nationality" refers to "citizenship" ; see UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status, Geneva, 1992, at [87]; and VSAB v MIMIA [2006] FCA 239 at [50] - [53] . Under the Hague Convention, it is for each state to determine under its own law who are its nationals. Whether a person has a particular nationality is a question of fact, in respect of which the Tribunal may acquaint itself with as much of the relevant foreign law as is necessary to make findings on the issue, including by reference to secondary sources of a non-scholarly nature, and expert evidence where appropriate: see VSAB, supra and Koe v MIMA (1997) 74 FCR 508 at 515. An applicant who has no country of nationality must be outside his or her "country of former habitual residence". A stateless person may have more than one country of former habitual residence, and (in contrast to the second paragraph of Article 1A(2) which deals with dual nationality) does not have to demonstrate a well-founded fear of being persecuted in relation to all such countries: see Al-Anezi v MIMA [1999] FCA 355 ; (1999) 92 FCR 283 at [22] and Taiem v MIMA [2001] FCA 611 ; (2002) 186 ALR 361. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] RRTA 54">In the agent's response she stated (at the 5 th dot point) that it was still unclear how the applicant's mother obtained his Russian passport, and that it might have been false as well, possibly obtained through corruption. Having considered the evidence, in the absence of the Russian passport, the Tribunal finds the initial reference to the applicant's mother obtaining Russian citizenship for the applicant has not been supported by any further evidence. Further, the reference to Russian 'citizenship' (or 'nationality' for the Tribunal's purposes --- see VSAB v MIMIA [2006] FCA 239 ) later became a reference to a Russian 'passport' which then was suggested may have been a false passport. The Tribunal finds that the applicant's mother did obtain a false Russian passport for him, but that he is not a national of Russia. As a result, the Tribunal has assessed the applicant's claims against Armenia.</sentence>
