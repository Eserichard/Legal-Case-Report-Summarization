<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] HCA 49">His Honour noted the timber, or the bark and wood from the timber, is "but an input into the process by which" the oil was produced [42] . His Honour concluded that the decision of the Northern Territory "not to maintain the plan to allow further growth of the trees on the Howard Springs land for harvesting for timber" [47] did not deprive the timber of its character as a "staple commercial product". However, the main basis for his Honour's conclusion, that there was no "supply" within the meaning of s 117 , was his finding that the licences were merely "permissive" [43] . The primary judge found that the trees and timber retained commercial value to the Northern Territory, and that there were residual commercial uses for them, for example, use as milled timber, woodchip mulch, pine oil extraction, potting mix and firewood [46] . His Honour also assumed for those purposes "that ACOC's alleged actions have infringed [the patent]" [40] . The primary judge had decided the issues as follows [4] : 

 
"[T]he grant of the licences to ACOC in their terms, and in their context, did not amount to the supply of the timber to ACOC so as to expose [the Territory] to liability as a contributory infringer of the patent under s 117(1) of the Act , even if - contrary to my conclusion - the conduct amounted to the use of the timber within s 117(2)(b) of the Act , and even assuming on the Collins' favour that the timber was used by ACOC so as to infringe the patent". Mr and Mrs Collins had accepted that, but for the fact that the Northern Territory had "written off" the Howard Springs Plantation as a commercial crop for use as timber, the timber in question would have been a "staple commercial product" [45] . The evidence disclosed that by November 1995 this expectation had been disappointed and the timber from the cypress pine plantations was no longer considered to be of suitable commercial quality for the original purposes for which the trees had been planted [33] . His Honour also made a finding of fact that the Northern Territory had reason to believe that ACOC would use the bark and wood from the timber in combination for the purpose of producing blue cypress oil [48] . Mansfield J considered that what had been supplied by the Northern Territory to ACOC was the timber, and ACOC then took the bark and wood of the timber and produced blue cypress oil from them [41] . The primary judge (Mansfield J) directed that there be a separate trial of issues as to whether [39] : 

 
"a. the [Northern Territory] has supplied a product to [ACOC] the use of which would infringe the patent; 
b. the product supplied by the [Northern Territory] ... is not a staple commercial product and its use is one which the [Northern Territory] had reason to believe would be used to produce a blue coloured oil by a process protected by the patent. His Honour said the word "supply" does [44] 

 
"not readily accommodate a licence which merely enabled ACOC to go upon the territory's land at Howard Springs and to harvest the trees there and to remove the timber so harvested.</sentence>
