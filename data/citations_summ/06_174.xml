<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 622">The test of apparent relevance has also been applied in relation to documents sought under a notice to produce. In Sportsbet Pty Ltd v State of New South Wales (No 9) [2010] FCA 31 , Perram J by reference to the approach taken by Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [6] , posed the test as whether the documents sought are "reasonably likely to add, in the end, in some way or other, to the relevant evidence in the case": at [3]. Perram J continued at [4]: 
Reasonable likelihood is a different concept to reasonable possibility and, to my mind, connotes a degree of certainty as to the material's potential relevance that travels beyond the merely conjectural. It is to be distinguished from the tests applicable in discovery. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 181">The Court considers that in deciding whether to set aside a notice to produce, the observations by Beaumont J can be usefully applied by analogy, as was observed by Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 11) [2006] FCA 174. Sackville J said at [6]: 
 
 It is now established that lack of apparent relevance is a ground for setting aside a subpoena or notice to produce: Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 90 at 101-103, per Beaumont J. In an earlier interlocutory judgment delivered in these proceedings, I said that the test of apparent relevance is whether the documents are 'reasonably likely to add, in the end, in some way or other, to the relevant evidence in the case': Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 5 ), at [10], citing Spencer Motors Pty Ltd v LNC Industries Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 921 at 927, per Waddell J. Neither party disputes that this is the appropriate test. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1372">The second ground of challenge to the Notice is that some of the documents sought by the Notice are irrelevant. As to the documents concerning para 1 of the Notice, they have an apparent relevance to the matters put in issue by BAT having regard to the 21 grounds of cross-appeal reflected in BAT's notice of cross-appeal and summarised briefly at [37] and [38] of these reasons because the documents sought by para 1 of the notice are reasonably likely to add, in the end, in some way or other to the relevant evidence in the case. The question is not whether each and every document is admissible for the purposes of s 55 of the Evidence Act but whether the documents have an apparent relevance because production of the documents is reasonably likely to add "in the end, in some way or other, to the relevant evidence in the case": Spencer Motors Pty Ltd v LNC Industries Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 921 at 927 per Waddell J; Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 90 at pp 101-103 per Beaumont J; National Employers' Mutual General Insurance Association Ltd v Waind and Hill [1978] 1 NSWLR 372 at p 385 per Moffitt P (Hutley and Glass JJA agreeing); Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No. 11) [2006] FCA 174 per Sackville J at [6]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] VCC 1804"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 739">If BlueScope wished to persuade me that it truly required the contentious documents in order to understand the issues raised in the arbitration, it should have tendered in evidence on the present application the documents which it already has and demonstrated to my satisfaction that those documents did not enable it fairly to present its case for a stay or summary dismissal. In that way it may have been able to persuade me that the evidentiary material which it seeks is reasonably likely to add, in the end, in some way or other, to the relevant evidence to be adduced in support of the relief which it claims in its Motion. It did not take this course. The onus was on BlueScope to establish the apparent relevance of the contentious documents in the sense explained by Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [6] . It has failed to discharge that onus. It does not contend that it requires the contentious documents for the purposes of understanding the issues in the arbitration. It confined its attention to potential overlaps in the evidence. On the evidence before me, the Notice to Produce cannot be supported on the grounds upon which BlueScope seeks to support it.  In Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [6] , his Honour said: It is now established that lack of apparent relevance is a ground for setting aside a subpoena or notice to produce: Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 90 at 101-103, per Beaumont J. In an earlier interlocutory judgment delivered in these proceedings, I said that the test of apparent relevance is whether the documents are 'reasonably likely to add, in the end, in some way or other, to the relevant evidence in the case': Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 5) , at [10], citing Spencer Motors Pty Ltd v LNC Industries Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 921 at 927, per Waddell J. Neither party disputes that this is the appropriate test.  It was submitted on behalf of CKI that: 
(a) The Court should apply an appropriate test of relevance in determining whether or not the Notice to Produce should be set aside. That test is "... whether the documents sought in the Notice are reasonably likely to add, in the end, in some way or other, to the relevant evidence in the case" ( Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 5) [2005] FCA 510 ; (2005) 216 ALR 147 at [5] ---[12]; and Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 11) [2006] FCA 174) ; 
 
(b) In the circumstances of the present case, the documents are not likely, in the end, to add to the relevant evidence in the case. The "case" to which the documents must be relevant is the claim for relief made by BlueScope in its Notice of Motion filed on 7 July 2010. In other words, the documents must be likely to add relevantly to BlueScope's claim that the proceedings should be stayed or summarily dismissed;
 
(c) The contentious documents are not necessary in order to enable BlueScope fairly to present its case for summary relief nor are they likely to add in any meaningful way to the relevant material which the Court will be called upon to consider when dealing with BlueScope's claim that the proceedings should be stayed or summarily dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 307">Ms Britton submits that the documents sought under the Notice to Produce are irrelevant for the purposes of the Court determining whether the Respondent has a Notice of Grounds of Opposition to the Creditor's Petition. It is submitted that it is established that any document sought under a Notice to Produce must be relevant and relies on the decisions in Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 90 at [101] --- [103]; Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No.11) [2006] FCA 174 ; Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 60. Further, the onus is on the Respondent to demonstrate the apparent relevance of a document that is sought by the Notice to Produce: Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (supra).  The Application in a Case seeks orders that the Notice to Produce dated 4 February 2010 be set aside. Rule 15A.17(ii) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth) provides that power. The documents sought under a Notice to Produce must be relevant and the lack of apparent relevance is a ground for setting aside a Notice to Produce: Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (No 2) (1989) 88 ALR 90 at 101 --- 103. The test of apparent relevance is whether the documents are reasonably likely to add, in the end, in some way or other, to the relevant evidence in the case: Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No.11) [2006] FCA 174 at [11] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 31">It has been said in this Court that the standard of relevance to be applied to a notice to produce is that the documents sought are "reasonably likely to add, in the end, in some way or other, to the relevant evidence in the case": see Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [6] , per Sackville J. That kind of relevance is often referred to as "apparent relevance". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 334">As I have previously said in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Minister for Communications Information Technology and the Arts [2007] FCA 1398 at [47] : 
 '47. Once documents have been produced to the court, any objections to their production having been rejected, the documents are in the control of the court. At this stage the person producing the documents may state that he objects to them being handed to a party seeking access to them for inspection. Documents should not go beyond the judge against the objection of the owner unless there is a valid reason to do so. Subject to matters such as confidentiality, it is for the judge, as part of the second step, to determine whether the documents appear relevant in the sense that they relate to the subject matter of the proceedings, in which event the judge will permit inspection by one or both parties at an appropriate time. The question of their admissibility without more, in accordance with the rules of evidence, does not then arise (per Moffitt P in Waind's case at 382-385 cf per Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Ltd (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [6] ). ' 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 227">Lack of apparent relevance is a ground for setting aside a subpoena or Notice to Produce: Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989 ) 88 ALR 90 at 101-3. The test of apparent relevance is whether the documents are reasonably likely to add, in the end, in some way or other, to the relevant evidence in the case: Seven Network Ltd v News Limited (No. 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [11] . The onus is on the issuer of the Notice to Produce to demonstrate the apparent relevance of the documents sought. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1952">25 Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the notice of motion can be dealt with together. A notice to produce may be set aside on the ground of lack of apparent relevance. The test of apparent relevance is whether the documents are reasonably likely to add, in the end, in some way or another, to the relevant evidence. Relevance in an evidentiary/admissibility sense is not the test. See Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (No 2) (1989) 88 ALR 90 at 101-103; Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [6] ; Telstra Corp Ltd v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts [2007] FCA 1398 at [44] - [48].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1147">2 A fourth matter was sought to be raised by way of a Notice of Motion filed by the Fifth Respondent on 31 July 2008 seeking to set aside part of a Notice to Produce served by the Applicants upon the Fifth Respondent. Documents pursuant to that Notice to Produce were produced on 24 July 2008. When such documents as were produced were made available, neither the Court nor the Applicants were told that there were additional documents which, it was later said, also fell within the terms of one of the Subpoenas presently sought to be set aside by the Fifth Respondent and that those documents were being withheld. A notice to produce has the same coercive effect as a subpoena: Federal Court Rules , O 33 r 12; Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [4] per Sackville J. The procedure to be followed when there is a " call " upon a notice to produce has been long-settled: Glass H (ed), Seminars on Evidence (1969) at 12---18. If documents which fall within a notice are not produced, it is incumbent upon those who have been served with such a notice to unequivocally identify those documents and the reason for their non-production. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 61">42 As has been said many times, a notice under O 33 r 12 has the same coercive effect as a subpoena for production. Compliance is mandatory unless the Court otherwise orders: Potts v Dennis Jones &amp; Co Pty Ltd (No. 2) (1995) 58 FCR 61 at 70. Similarly, the considerations which apply to the setting aside of a subpoena are equally applicable to a notice to produce: Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 450 and Crown Joinery Pty Ltd v Lyleho Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 214. The grounds on which a notice to produce may be set include that it is too wide, oppressive or fishing. The issues in the case and the possible relevance of the document or documents to those issues are obviously relevant in deciding whether the notice is fishing: Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [6] .</sentence>

<sentence id="cs13" from="[2006] FCA 1200">The applicants' counsel told the Court that nowhere in the statements of issues and contentions of any of the parties is there a reference to either the Act or the section in question. There is no doubt that a Notice to Produce may be set aside if the documents sought by it lack apparent relevance to the proceeding: Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 90 at 102-103; Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [6] . In this case, the documents sought have been discovered and so are prima facie relevant. Other than the assertion from the bar table that the Act and section in question are not to be found in the statements of issues and contentions, no attempt has been made by the applicants to demonstrate that the documents are not relevant. That assertion is at any rate of limited assistance: the proceeding is still at an interlocutory stage and submissions on the substantive issues between the parties are yet to be made. The tentative submission of the applicants that document 1434 is not relevant is insufficient to displace the document's prima facie relevance. </sentence>
