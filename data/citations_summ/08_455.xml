<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 60">
 
 53 Where the amount in dispute or the validity of the charge is disputed, the protection afforded a mortgagee on an interlocutory application for an injunction seems to rest upon the possible inadequacy of the ordinary undertaking as to damages. [10] In CMG Equity Investments Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [11] Finklestein J said, [12] 
 
 
 The second point is a practical one. It concerns the undertaking in damages. Sometimes an undertaking is not enough to obtain an injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 638">5 The GMSLA to which reference is made in the "Documentation" section is not in evidence. But the parties argued the case on the assumption (as was the fact) that I was familiar with its terms. A derivative of the GMSLA is the subject of my judgments in Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited [2008] FCA 594 and CMG Equity Investments Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2008] FCA 455. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] NSWSC 345">33 There are presently in the Federal Court in Victoria, before Justice Finkelstein, two somewhat similar matters and there may be more. Those matters involve both Opes and the ANZ Bank. An application for an interlocutory injunction in one of them, namely CMG Equity Investments v ANZ Banking Group Limited [2008] FCA 455 has been dismissed.</sentence>
