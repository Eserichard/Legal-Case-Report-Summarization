<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 48">7 The appellant appealed to this Court under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) to set aside the decision of the Tribunal. That appeal was successful: Piotto v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCA 1115. The primary judge ordered that the decision of the Tribunal of 1 May 2008 be set aside, and remitted the matter to the Tribunal for reconsideration. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 109">The absent documents were copies of activity agreements bearing the signature of the applicant. The respondent alleged that these agreements were breached which gave rise to the participation failures. Additionally, there was an absence of documented proof of the authority of the relevant Employment Services Providers (ESPs) and their officers to enter into agreements with the applicant. That is to say, there was an absence of proof of a lawful or valid delegation concerning the appointment of the applicable ESPs and their employees (refer Piotto v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCA 1115). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 914">On 8 October 2009 being approximately three weeks before the hearing of this review, Marshall J in the Federal Court delivered a decision in Piotto v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCA 1115 ( Piotto ). Mr Piotto had been the subject of a finding of three NPFs in a 12 month period. His Honour decided that by reason of there not being any evidence before the Tribunal of the authority or delegation of the job network provider or its officers there was not in the circumstances any lawful or valid delegation in the finding of participation failures. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1116">This proceeding was heard concurrently with proceeding VID 337 of 2008; see Piotto v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCA 1115. Each proceeding arises out of "Newstart participation failures" imposed on Mr Piotto by the respondent and subsequent decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") to affirm those decisions. </sentence>
