<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 646">In some cases, one sufficient consequence flowing from the making of a declaration arises from the public interest in having such an order made to indicate the Court's disapproval of particular conduct. The public interest in protecting Australian consumers from misleading conduct often warrants the making of a declaration ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chen [2003] FCA 897 ; (2003) 132 FCR 309 at [47] --- [48]) and a declaration can be made to mark the Court's disapproval of conduct ( ACCC v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd (deregistered) [2006] FCA 1534 at [8] , ACCC v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30] and [34], Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) [1993] FCA 83 ; [1993] FCA 83 ; (1993) 41 FCR 89 at 99---100 and ACCC v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 693 ; (2004) 207 ALR 392 at [21] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 605">Further the Court is required to ensure that the party seeking the declaration has a real interest in seeking that relief: see Forster at 437 and Ainsworth at 582. And, finally, the Court has to ensure that there are sufficient consequences flowing from the making of the declaration that it is appropriate for it to exercise its discretion to do so. 

 
 This latter aspect may include the public interest in having such a declaration made to indicate the Court's disapproval of particular conduct, assist in clarifying the law on a particular matter, or assist to inform consumers about a particular matter of concern: see Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Limited v Cassidy [2003] FCAFC 289 , (2003) 135 FCR 1 , (2003) ALR 402 ('MBF') at [50] - [52]; ACCC v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd (deregistered ) [2006] FCA 1534 at [8] , ACCC v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30] and [34]; Tobacco Institute at 99-100, ACCC v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 693 ; (2004) 207 ALR 392 at [21] and ACCC v Pacific Dunlop [2001] FCA 740 at [59] - [69]. 

 
 However, the Court should not impede settlements by refusing to give effect to the terms of settlements made by the parties where the proposed orders are within the Court's jurisdiction and appropriate. Thus, the Court should be slow to substitute its own view of the orders or undertakings for those which have been agreed by the parties as part of the terms of settlement: see ACCC v Real Estate Institute Western Australia (above ) at [22], ACCC v Virgin Mobile Australia Pty Ltd (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1987">24 In regulatory contexts comparable to the present, this Court has informed itself as to those facts necessary for the granting of declaratory relief by reference to agreed facts and indeed the consent of the parties: Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV 'Mawashi Al Gasseem' (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 at [10] ---[16] [2007] FCA 815 ; , 240 ALR 120 at 122---4; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1534 at [10] per Nicholson J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v EDirect Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 65 at [20] ---[30], ATPR 42---216; Secretary, Department of Health &amp; Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [74] ---[79]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30], [34], ATPR 41---801.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1956">20 This latter aspect may include the public interest in having such a declaration made to indicate the Court's disapproval of particular conduct, assist in clarifying the law on a particular matter, or assist to inform consumers about a particular matter of concern: see Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Limited v Cassidy [2003] FCAFC 289 , (2003) 135 FCR 1 , (2003) ALR 402 (' MBF') at [50] - [52]; ACCC v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd ( deregistered ) [2006] FCA 1534 at [8] , ACCC v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30] and [34]; Tobacco Institute at 99-100, ACCC v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 693 ; (2004) 207 ALR 392 at [21] and ACCC v Pacific Dunlop [2001] FCA 740 at [59] - [69]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1545">77 Declarations have thus been made by consent by this Court in the context of a party admitting a contravention of the Trade Practices Act : eg, Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1534 at [10] per Nicholson J. The authorities and the approach of this Court to the making of declarations by consent have also recently been usefully summarised by Reeves J in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v EDirect Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 65 at [20] ---[30], ATPR 42-216. See also: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30] , [34], ATPR 41-801. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 65">21. On the first, there is little doubt that the Court has a wide discretionary power to make declarations of right under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): see Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437-438 and Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 581-582. When the Court is asked to make declarations of right by consent it is required to scrutinise the orders sought to satisfy itself that it has the power to make those orders and that they are appropriate: see ACCC v Real Estate Institute Industry of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79 at [1] and [17] and ACCC v Virgin Mobile Australia Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2002] FCA 1548 at [1] . This means that the Court has to ensure that the declaration sought is directed to determining a legal controversy and not to answering abstract or hypothetical questions. Further the Court is required to ensure that the party seeking the declaration has a real interest in seeking that relief. And, finally, the Court has to ensure that there are sufficient consequences flowing from the making of the declaration that it is appropriate for it to exercise its discretion to do so. This later aspect may include the public interest in having such a declaration made to indicate the Court's disapproval of particular conduct: see ACCC v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd ( deregistered ) [2006] FCA 1534 at [8] , ACCC v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30] and [34], Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No.2) [1993] FCA 83 ; (1993) 41 FCR 89 at 99 - 100 and ACCC v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 693 ; (2004) 207 ALR 392 at [21] . </sentence>
