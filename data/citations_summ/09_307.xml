<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1373">The Federal Magistrate adopted the approach that damages under s 115(2) of the Copyright Act were at large, relying on A V Jennings Ltd v Bogdan (2009) 80 IPR 356; [2009] FCA 307 at [96]. On this basis the Federal Magistrate continued: 
 
 [318] In my view, there was a clear breach of copyright by Urban Design in relation to the plans for the Solitaire house. I accept that the state of the evidence in relation to damages relied upon by the Applicant is poor; it is more by inference than by anything else. Indeed, it is difficult to see, and (as already stated) there is very little evidence of, any actual damage the Applicant has suffered. 
 

 
 
 [319] However, 'doing the best to make a just and fair assessment of the quantum of damages', and having regard to (a) the limited --- and sometimes somewhat conflicting - evidence in relation to the cost of construction of the Dunlop house, (b) the fact that none of the Respondents ever actually owned the Dunlop house, (c) the "exorbitant licence fee" proposed by Mr Pekic and Mr Turcin for the use of the Solitaire plans, (d) the somewhat speculative nature of the "profit" on the sale of the Dunlop house (taken notably from comments --- as opposed to documentary evidence of any kind - from Mr Turcin in cross-examination, and likewise from Mr Martins' cross-examination), (e) the fact that there is no evidence of any continuing or repetition of any infringement --- indeed, I accept without hesitation Ms Olsson's submission that this was a "one-off event" --- and, (e) the cases to which I have referred, in my view an appropriate award of damages is $10,000, which represents 25% of the asserted profit on the building of the Dunlop house.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 185">Leaving aside questions of account of profits, damages, and contribution/indemnity, in the context of copyright and "project homes" (and plans thereof), the following sample of cases (and regularly cited other authority therein, such as SW Hart &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water Systems , Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) , Data Access Corporation v Powerflex Services Pty Ltd , Francis Day &amp; Hunter Ltd v Bron , and Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd ) [134] details relevant principles: Beck v Montana Constructions Pty Ltd , [135] Lend Lease Homes Pty Ltd v Warrigal Homes Pty Ltd , [136] Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes , [137] LED Builders Pty Ltd v Eagle Homes Pty Ltd , [138] Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd , [139] Tolmark Homes Pty Ltd v Paul , [140] Dixon Projects Pty Ltd v Hallmark Homes , [141] Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd, [142] Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd , [143] Metricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd , [144] Inform Design and Construction Pty Ltd v Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd , [145] A V Jennings Ltd v Bogdan. [146] Having regard to the principles set out in these (and other) cases to which I will refer in detail as required, I move to a consideration of the following questions, which were noted earlier in these reasons. Does copyright subsist in the plans for and the house built by Solitaire? Who owned the copyright in the plans and the Solitaire house?</sentence>
