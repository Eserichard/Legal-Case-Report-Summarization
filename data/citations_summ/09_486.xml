<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 81">After discussing the approach taken to ss.424AA and 424A of the Act by the Full Court of the Federal Court in SZMCD and the approach taken to s.424A by Flick J in SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (No 2) (2009) 109 ALD 242 ; [2009] FCA 486 , Bromberg J found (at [57]) that in the particular circumstances of the case before him the Tribunal had failed to provide clear particulars of the information in question. There was said to be a lack of sufficient specificity. His Honour was of the view that the wording employed by the Tribunal at the hearing lacked the necessary clarity in identifying whether its concern related to the whole of the evidence of the priests put to the applicant or simply to that part of it that directly refuted the applicant's claims. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 18">However, the clarity and detail of information provided pursuant to s.359A(1)(a) may be sufficient to lead to the situation where the Tribunal has complied with s.359A(1)(b), without giving the explanation which that paragraph contemplates. Even if the Tribunal fails to take independent steps under s.359A(1)(b) to ensure that an applicant understands why particularised information is relevant to the review, that relevance may be self-evident from the information itself: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v SZGMF at [41]; Wang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 488 at [29] . As Flick J said in SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (No.2) [2009] FCA 486 ; (2009) 109 ALD 242 in relation to the RRT's equivalent of s.359A(1): Although s 424A(1) imposes the trinity of requirements set forth in paras (a), (b) and (c), it is not considered that compliance with s 424A(1) is necessarily to be approached by considering each of the three requirements as though it were divorced from the rest. The greater the degree of clarity in the "particulars of any information" provided, the less may be the exposition needed to convey the relevance of that information to the review being undertaken; the greater the uncertainty in the information being provided, the greater may be the need to explain why it may be relevant. Section 424A(1)(b) remains a requirement to be satisfied; but the steps to be undertaken to discharge that requirement may well depend upon the clarity with which the information has been identified and indeed the character of that information. (at 254 [52]) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 119"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] RRTA 1175">In respect of s.91R(3) it was submitted that other recent decisions of the Tribunal had dealt with the issue and attention was drawn to these. A recent decision of the Federal Court of Australia, SZNKW v. MIAC (2010) FCA 55 which found that s.91R(3) could have application where an applicant was found not to be homosexual was referred to, however, a distinction with the present case was drawn it being submitted that the applicant's homosexuality should be accepted. The summary of s.91R(3) consideration at paragraph 13 of SZMTJ v. MAIC (No.2) 2009 FCA 486 was referred to. It was submitted that where an applicant was homosexual before arrival in Australia it would be expected that he would engage in homosexual conduct in Australia. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 1007">While in some circumstances the obligation to comply with s.424A(1) may require disclosure of the whole of a document containing information (even if the whole document cannot itself be described as information), having regard to the facts and the circumstances of this case it has not been established that a meaningful opportunity to comment or respond on information within s.424A(1) required the disclosure to the applicant of the whole of the content of the business visa application as part of the context in which the information about the fact and date of the application and the Tribunal's concerns about the accompanying documents were put to him. The information referred to in the s.424A letter and its potential relevance were identified with sufficient clarity (see SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (No 2) (2009) 109 ALD 242 ; [2009] FCA 486). The applicant has not pointed to any particular aspect of the business visa application as relevant surrounding context. The Tribunal did not " attribute " the business visa application to the applicant, but rather found that he was involved in the preparation of his visa application and travel arrangements. The Tribunal rejected his claims about his lack of knowledge of the application in the context of considering his delayed departure from Cameroon after the visa was granted. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 1250">Further, the nature and content of the obligations upon the Tribunal under s 424A(1) were recently summarised by Flick J in SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Anor (No 2) [2009] FCA 486. I respectfully agree with his Honour's observations at [52] that each of the requirements of s 424A are not to be treated as though they were divorced one from the next. The greater degree of clarity in the particulars of any information provided, the less may be the exposition needed to convey the relevance of that information to the review being undertaken; the greater the uncertainty in the information being provided, the greater may be the need to explain why it may be relevant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 1282">Mr Smith contended that the particulars of the information were clearly stated and that consequently there was reduced need for an articulation of the relevance of the information to the review, and the consequences of the information being relied upon in affirming the decision under review: SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No. 2) [2009] FCA 486. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 559">The nature and content of the obligations upon the Tribunal under s 424A(1) were recently summarised by Flick J in SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Anor (No 2) [2009] FCA 486. I respectfully agree with his Honour's observations at [52] that each of the requirements of s 424A are not to be treated as though they were divorced one from the next. The greater degree of clarity in the particulars of any information provided, the less may be the exposition needed to convey the relevance of that information to the review being undertaken; the greater the uncertainty in the information being provided, the greater may be the need to explain why it may be relevant. The same observations are applicable to s 424AA. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 775">In relation to ground 2, the Minister submits that it is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons that the applicant committed visa fraud to achieve a particular migration outcome and that she only revealed that fraud when she wished to obtain a new visa, and that those findings were based on a reasoning that the applicant acted in ways expedient to her immediate wishes, not to strengthen her refugee claims [2] . The Minister further submits that the applicant's claims in relation to domestic conflict in Australia were implicitly accepted by the Tribunal as being not undertaken for the purpose of strengthening her protection visa claims, to the extent that that conflict might be seen as "conduct" [3] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 473">This was cited with approval in SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2009] FCA 486 (" SZMTJ ") per Flick J, where it was also said at [51] to [52]: "Although s 424A(1) imposes the trinity of requirements set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), it is not considered that compliance with s 424A(1) is necessarily to be approached by considering each of the three requirements as though it were divorced from the rest. The greater the degree of clarity in the "particulars of any information" provided, the less may be the exposition needed to convey the relevance of that information to the review being undertaken; the greater the uncertainty in the information being provided, the greater may be the need to explain why it may be relevant. Section 424A(1)(b) remains a requirement to be satisfied; but the steps to be undertaken to discharge that requirement may well depend upon the clarity with which the information has been identified and indeed the character of that information. In the present proceeding, the information set forth by the Tribunal in its 28 July 2008 letter has been identified with such detail that it was readily apparent that the Appellant's response was being sought as to how that information could be compatible with a genuine claim to fear persecution. There is no uncertainty that what was being sought was his comment as to how he could credibly be claiming to fear persecution in the light of the information set forth. " </sentence>
