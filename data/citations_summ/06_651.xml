<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] FMCA 1204">I am equally satisifed that this is not a case such as that considered by Tamberlin J in S266/2003 v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 651 where as his Honour says at [8]: 
 
 
 "The Tribunal notes that the applicant has not provided details of the history of involvement, what has happened to him as a result of any alleged persecution..." 
 

which enabled him to say at [15]:
 
 
 "The reference to "information" in s.424A does not encompass a failure to mention a matter to the Tribunal.</sentence>
