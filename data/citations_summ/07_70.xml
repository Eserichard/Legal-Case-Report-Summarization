<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 779">The respondent's options in relation to the infringement proceedings will depend on the goods and services covered by the MYTHBUSTERS trade mark that the respondent is permitted to register. If the respondent obtains a trade mark registration in relation to books only, the respondent is unlikely to succeed in an infringement proceeding against any of the applicants. In the respondent's failed Federal Court proceedings before Buchanan J against the applicants [8] His Honour said: "208. During the course of the proceedings I permitted Mr Knight to amend his Statement of Claim to plead causes of action against the first, second, third and sixth respondents in relation to the three spin-off books. The amendment was permitted in circumstances where, although it was opposed by the respondents, counsel for the respondents very fairly and properly conceded that he could not argue any question of prejudice arising from the amendment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 170">1 The appellant, Mr Andrew Knight, appeals from a judgment of a judge of the Court which dismissed an application alleging that the respondents had breached the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("TPA") and engaged in the tort of passing off: see Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 70 ; 71 IPR 466. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1123">25 I have also found it unnecessary to consider an affidavit sworn by Pamela Anne Summers on 30 July 2007. The first respondent faced difficulties in seeking to rely on it. The affidavit was not in evidence in the Federal Magistrates Court, although, according to the first respondent, this point was not taken below. I doubt that the first respondent's reliance on s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) was sustainable. I doubt that Ms Summers' familiarity with the practice and procedures of the Tribunal would constitute "specialised knowledge" upon which the opinion she gives can be said to be wholly or substantially based for the purposes of this provision: compare Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 70 at [106] - [107] per Black CJ, Emmett and Middleton JJ. The affidavit was not formally filed until the hearing, although, according to the first respondent, this was the result of the applicants' tardiness in filing their submissions. Ultimately, the first respondent did not press the tender of the affidavit, although counsel outlined a case for its admissibility, in the terms indicated.</sentence>
