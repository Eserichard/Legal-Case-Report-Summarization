<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 55">On 10 December 2007, I published my conclusions concerning a number of issues in this proceeding (see Frauenstein v Farinha [2007] FCA 1953). In these present reasons, terms have the same meanings in those reasons as I assigned to them in my earlier reasons of 10 December 2007. For convenience, I have set out those defined terms in Schedule 1 to these reasons.  In summary, while I would not, at this stage, be prepared to make any order against the Farinhas personally, I do not propose to rule that out as a possibility. The precise nature and terms of any order will depend upon detailed examination of such further evidence as the parties wish to adduce along the lines foreshadowed in my earlier reasons and during the course of the earlier conduct of the proceeding. I propose to direct the parties, after they have had an opportunity of considering these reasons, to bring in short minutes of directions for the further conduct of the proceeding. I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Emmett. Associate:
