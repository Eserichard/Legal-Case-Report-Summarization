<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 720">Subject to O 6 r 6, O 6 r 1 of the Rules provides that an applicant may claim relief in any proceeding in respect of more than one cause of action. Order 6 r 6 provides that where any joinder of parties or of causes of action may complicate or delay trial of the proceeding or is otherwise inconvenient, the Court may order separate trials or make such other order as the Court thinks fit. The Court's discretion under this rule is broad and should be exercised so as to promote a just resolution of the parties' disputes, while taking into account the importance of limiting the costs and delay of the litigation: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Axis International Management Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 250 at [9] per Gilmour J, citing Bishop v Bridgelands Securities (1990) 25 FCR 311. Considerations of cost and delay, I should add, apply with even more force in the light of the Parliament's express direction in ss 37M and 37N of the FCA Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 110">85 There was a suggestion in submissions that Mr Ghose could be excused from attendance at some of the hearing, and possibly even that some issues that did not concern him could be determined as separate questions. Reference was made to cases in which, in large and complex proceedings, the Court has arranged the trial in stages, so as to make it unnecessary for all parties to attend all parts of the hearing (citing Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Axis International Management Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 250 at [27] ; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Somerville [2008] NSWSC 788 at [48] - [50], [57]; Dean-Willcocks and Another v Air Transit International Pty Ltd and Others [2002] NSWSC 525 ; (2002) 55 NSWLR 64 at [70] ; Main-Rd Property Group Pty Ltd v Pelligra &amp; Sons Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 43 at [25] ; Jendas Pty Ltd v Jolly [1997] 2 VR 106 at 107.</sentence>
