<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 754">In Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1976 ; (2008) 253 ALR 89 at 107-108 [25] - [27] Lindgren J identified 11 propositions relating to the fixing of penalties under the Trade Practices Act as flowing from the decisions in NW Foods [1996] FCA 1134 ; 71 FCR 285 and Mobil [2004] FCAFC 72 ; (2004) ATPR 41-993 (and these were recently applied by Jacobson J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v PRK Corporation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 715 at [20] - [24]). These included the propositions that: the Court is not obliged to commence its reasoning with the level of the agreed penalty and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the range; the Court is entitled to address the question independently at the outset of its reasoning; the admissions and agreed facts should not be approached as if they had been "tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the [regulator] in proving its case"; the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning said to justify a discounted penalty. </sentence>
