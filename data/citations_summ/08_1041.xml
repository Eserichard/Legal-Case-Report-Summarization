<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 863">In Fig Tree Developments Ltd v Australian Property Custodian Holdings Ltd [2008] FCA 1041 at [45] et seq I had occasion to review various authorities touching upon the practice which has come to be described as "redaction" but which in earlier years was known as "masking out" or just "covering up" portions of discovered documents produced for inspection. In so doing I reviewed cases concerning that practice both as applied to portions of documents in respect of which privilege was claimed and as applied to documents only parts of which were said to be relevant. It would only add unnecessarily to the length of this judgment to repeat what I there stated. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 354">Lastly, the respondent argued that Dr Toben was provoked by Mr Jones' publication in the Australian Jewish News to publishing the material which he did and breaching the undertaking. The respondent relied on Fig Tree Developments Ltd v Australian Property Custodial Holdings [2008] FCA 1041. I do not, with respect, think that that case stands for the proposition which was put. That case involved an application for discovery and the judge made some observations about a party having the right to apply to be released from an undertaking. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] WASC 67">20 The earlier practice in the Federal Court was consistent with the line enunciated in GE Capital Corporate Finance Group Ltd (see for example Optus Communications Pty Ltd v Telstra Corp Ltd [1995] FCA 1215 and Wimmera Industrial Minerals Pty Ltd v RGC Minerals Sands Ltd [1998] FCA 299). However, the practice enunciated by McLelland CJ in Eq in New South Wales now appears to be established in the practice of the Federal Court (see in addition to Gray and ACCC v McMahon , Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1335 ; Candacal Pty Ltd v Industry Research &amp; Development Board [2005] FCA 649 ; Garnet International Resources Pty Ltd v Barton International Inc [2005] FCA 93 ; Westfield Management Ltd v Brisbane Airport Corp Ltd [2004] FCA 611 and Fig Tree Developments Ltd v Australian Property Custodian Holdings Ltd [2008] FCA 1041 , especially [48]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 12">18 The applicant submits that the rule of practice identified in GE Capital does not apply under the Rules of this Court. He submits that a party making discovery is not entitled to seal up or mask parts or sections of a document unless he has the consent of the other party or the permission of the Court. He refers to Telstra Corp v Australis Media Holdings (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division, McLelland CJ in Eq, 10 February 1997) (" Telstra Corp "); Gray v Associated Book Publishers (Aust) Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1045 (" Gray ") and Fig Tree Developments Ltd v Australian Property Custodian Holdings Ltd [2008] FCA 1041. In Gray , Branson J said (at [15]-[16]):
 15 In my view, where in this Court categories of documents are required to be discovered and thereafter made available for inspection, the true obligation on the party giving discovery is the same as that identified by McLelland CJ in Eq in Telstra Corporation v Australis Media Holdings by reference to Pt 23 of the New South Wales Supreme Court Rules. The Chief Judge there said: 
 
 "Under the new discovery rules, Pt 23 of the Supreme Court Rules, ... classes of documents required to be discovered may be, and were in the present case, specified not by reference to relevance to a fact or facts in issue, but by description of the nature of the documents, rendering it unnecessary to consider questions of relevance to an issue, as such. If in such cases the party giving discovery desires to withhold, by making [sic] or otherwise, production of part of a discoverable document on the ground that that part does not contribute to the satisfaction of any of the criteria by reference to which the class of documents is described, then it may be that a case can be made for giving effect to that desire, but in my view, unless there is some relevant qualification in the order for discovery, the order requires that the whole document be produced unless there is an agreement to the contrary by the party to which discovery is being made, or unless relief from the requirement, for example by making [sic] certain portions is obtained from the Court. 
 
16 The respondents did not obtain the agreement of the applicant to the masking of portions of their discovered documents, nor did they seek relief from the Court from their prima facie obligations to allow full inspection of their discovered documents. Nonetheless, having regard to the course of argument on the applicant's notice of motion, it seems appropriate now to give consideration to the claim of the respondents that the masking undertaken by them is appropriate in the circumstances and ought to be authorised by the Court. </sentence>
