<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 353">65 Furthermore the Court should not go behind a judgment debt where to do so would, if the debtor's objections be successful, only support a finding that the debt be reduced but would still leave an amount in excess of the amount on which a creditor may petition. The reduction will only be relevant if the amount contained in the bankruptcy notice would be reduced to an amount below the minimum amount that supports a petition. In the present case, even if the AAT proceedings were successful, there would remain an amount owing on which the applicant may petition: Emerson v Wreckair Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 16 ; (1992) 33 FCR 581 at 589; Wilson v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [1999] FCA 1760 ; Spencer v Lane Rowin Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1519 at [21] - [24]. </sentence>
