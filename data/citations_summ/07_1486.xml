<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 21">I note that the question as to what may be an "issue" for these purposes was considered by Barnes FM in SZHZD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 4 (" SZHZD ") (upheld on appeal: SZHZD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1200) (see generally [27] to [67] and, in particular, [34] to [43] as to the matter of "issue" in this context, and the Tribunal's relevant obligation). I respectfully agree with her Honour's analysis of the approach to be taken to discern what relevantly is an "issue" for the purposes of s.425(1). On this matter, I also draw guidance from what was said in SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 (" SZJUB ") per Bennett J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1013">I note also what was relevantly set out in SZHBX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1169 (" SZHBX ") per Edmonds J at [13] to [14], and SZJUB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 per Bennet J at [16] ("where the Tribunal made it clear that it was 'starting afresh' the appellant could not have assumed that the reasons given by the delegate would identify for her the issues that arose in relation to that decision because she was not aware of the content of that decision"). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1067">The appellant submits that the Tribunal failed to fulfil its obligation in s 425(1) of the Act in that it did not advise the appellant that the claimed connection between the police and the CPI(M) was an issue arising in relation to the decision under review. Again, he refers to SZBEL . This submission must be rejected. Nothing occurred before the Tribunal hearing which could have led the appellant to assume that the claimed connection between the police and the CPI(M) was not an issue before the Tribunal. I say that because the appellant did not raise the claimed connection before the hearing ( SZJUB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 at [21] per Bennett J; SZDTM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1258 at [72] per Dowsett J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 530">The reasoning of McKerracher J in NBKS appears to be an implicit rejection of the view of Barnes FM in the Court below that the 'issues' need only be raised during the entire conduct of the review, and this can include 'issues' raised by previous Tribunal members. [13] SZISM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 61 ; (2007) 158 FCR 292 per Black CJ, Weinberg and Allsop JJ at [27].

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 473">In reply, Mr Potts submitted that in the " SZBEL sense", an "issue arising in relation to the decision under review" is an issue which is critical or dispositive of the review. Mr Potts referred the Court to SZJUB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 at [25] , and SZLRJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1714 at [32] , for the proposition that the Tribunal is obliged to put an applicant on notice of an issue, but not each fact that relates to it. In this regard, Mr Potts submitted that what was raised by the Tribunal at the hearing (see T 7 to T 8) was sufficient to put the applicant on notice as to the relevant issue. That is, that there was nothing before the Tribunal to suggest that the neighbour had caused problems for any other Sikhs in the neighbourhood. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 201">Further, the Tribunal is required to advise the applicant of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material; Commissioner for ACT Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576. What is obviously open can only be identified by having regard to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review; SZBEL [at 38]. A process of characterisation must be undertaken to identify what the dispositive or determinative issues are; that is the issues on which the decision to reject the applicant's claim is based; see SZJUB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486. The Tribunal is not required to identify the significance of the questions that it puts to the applicant or the ultimate matter of issue to which those questions go: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Applicant A125 of 2003 [2007] FCAFC 162 ; (2007) 163 FCR 285 at [88] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 149">The Tribunal must identify the dispositive or determinative issues: see SZJUB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486. However, the Tribunal is not required to identify the significance of the questions that it puts to the applicant or the ultimate matter of the issue to which those questions may be relevant: see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Applicant A125 of 2003 [2007] FCAFC 162 ; (2007) 243 ALR 691 at [88] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1714">32 The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material: Alphaone [1994] FCA 1074 ; 49 FCR 576. What is obviously open to the decision-maker can only be identified by having regard to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review: SZBEL [2006] HCA 63 ; 228 CLR 152 [at 38]. An exercise in characterisation must be undertaken to identify what the dispositive or determinative issues are; that is, the issues on which the decision to reject the appellant's claim is based: see SZJUB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486. The Tribunal is not required to identify the significance of the questions that it puts to the appellant or the ultimate matter of issue to which those questions go: Applicant A125 [2007] FCAFC 162 ; 163 FCR 285 at [88] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 1200">6 The Federal Magistrate also noted the recent decision of Bennett J in SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 , where in relation to the operation of s 425 her Honour observed at [25] that, insofar as "factual matters that go to the issue arising in relation to the decision under review" were concerned, "the Tribunal was not obliged to put each of those factual matters to the appellant. The Tribunal is obliged to inform her of the [determinative] issue but not of each fact that relates to it". In the present case, the Federal Magistrate found that the determinative issue underlying the Tribunal decision was its adverse view of the appellant's credibility. Her Honour held that the Tribunal's questions at the hearing clearly indicated to the appellant that everything in his account was in question; at [50]-[51].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 1042">I note also what was relevantly set out in SZHBX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1169 (" SZHBX ") per Edmonds J at [13]-[14], and SZJUB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 per Bennet J at [16] ("where the Tribunal made it clear that it was 'starting afresh' the appellant could not have assumed that the reasons given by the delegate would identify for her the issues that arose in relation to that decision because she was not aware of the content of that decision". ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 1001">In further understanding what was said in said in SZBEL , the first respondent has referred the Court to: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Applicant A125 of 2003 [2007] FCAFC 162 (" A125 of 2003 ") per Emmett, Weinberg and Lander JJ at [88]: "... s 425 does not require the RRT to identify the significance of the questions that it puts to a claimant or the ultimate matter or issue to which those questions go. That is not what is required by SZBEL, and is an attempt to import the requirements of s 424A(1) into s 425. " SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 per Bennett J at [23] and [28]: "23 As to the appellant's willingness to risk her livelihood and her dependent child, the Tribunal inquired as to risk generally. The Tribunal did not raise with the appellant the specific question of why she would take the risk of smuggling Bibles when she had a business and an eleven year old dependent child. ... 28 In the context of the Tribunal decision, the business and the child were not the issues on which the decision to reject the appellant's claim were based.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 910">35 Smith FM said at [40]-[41]:
 
 In my opinion, it should have been apparent to him [the appellant] and his advisers when doing so, that the Tribunal might draw inferences from the absence of any identification of particular persons who were feared, or of incidents or circumstances which suggested that there were particular persons who had an interest in pursuing him after 20 years (compare Bennett J in SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 at [21] and SZHBX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1169 at [14] ). In my opinion, the obligations on the Tribunal under s.425 to warn an applicant as to the issues in the review did not, in the present case, require it to alert the applicant to the possibility that it might draw an inference from his evidence that he could not name or identify the persons whom he claimed to fear. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 754">In my opinion, the issue of whether the new claims made in the statutory declaration would be believed by the Tribunal must have been patent to the applicant and his solicitor at the time when they were submitted. The solicitor chose not to make any submission addressing that issue. I do not consider that any obligations to warn that the new claims might be disbelieved arose under principles applied in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 (cf. SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 at [21] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FMCA 553">Mr Sivaloganathan submits that there is no evidence that the Tribunal misapplied the test in SZKSY. There was no requirement for the Tribunal to put to the applicant at the hearing every fact underpinning its finding regarding her Falun Gong practice: SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486. The Tribunal's rejected the Falun Gong claims on the adverse credibility finding it made about the applicant's political opinion. In finding that it did not accept the applicant's assertion that she fled China because of her political opinion, actual or imputed, or membership of a particular social group, the Tribunal assessed her claim of fear of persecution: WAEE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 at [47]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FMCA 254">In his evidence to the Tribunal (the Tribunal's account is not challenged by the applicants now), the applicant husband told the Tribunal that his then migration agent had made a "mistake" and whatever information had been given to the first respondent was "incorrect", and the applicant husband raised a new set of claims for the first time before the Tribunal. In relation to the applicant husband therefore, it is clear that, as Mr Potts submits, he would have understood that the Tribunal was starting "afresh", and could not have assumed that any of the determinative issues before the delegate would identify for him the issues that arose in relation to the decision ( SZJUB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 at [16] and [21]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FMCA 243">Other than reference to SZBEL itself, neither party before the Court provided any further authority in relation to the matter of what may properly be understood as an "the issue" for the purposes of s.425 and SZBEL . I note, however, that the matter as to what may be an "issue" for these purposes was recently considered by Barnes FM in SZHZD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 4 (" SZHZD ") (see generally [27] to [67] and, in particular, [34] to [43]) as to the matter of "issue" in this context, and the Tribunal's relevant obligation). I respectfully agree with Her Honour's analysis of the meaning of "issue" for the purposes of s.425(1). On this matter, I also draw guidance from what was said in SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 (" SZJUB ") per Bennett J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] FMCA 132">SZBEL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 81 ALJR 515 shows that s.425 obligations attach to issues which are determinative in relation to the decision under review. In this case the relevant issue was the claim that the applicant and his family had been observant Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia. The material contained in the communication from Mr Kalin was no more than factual information which the Tribunal took into account when determining that issue: SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486. Consequently, receipt of the communication from Mr Kalin did not require the Tribunal to send a further s.425 invitation to the applicant to attend a hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FMCA 4">The nature of the s.425 obligation is illustrated by the approach taken by Bennett J in SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486. In that case the appellant had claimed to be involved in a Bible smuggling operation and to be targeted by authorities. The Tribunal did not raise with her the specific questions of why she would take the risk of smuggling Bibles when she had a business and also an 11 year old dependent child. It relied on these matters in its decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FMCA 34">The nature of the characterisation required and the extent of the s.425 obligation is illustrated by the approach taken by Bennett J in SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486. In that case one of the grounds relied on by the appellant raised the question of whether there had been a breach of s.425 in that the Tribunal had failed to raise a specific issue at the Tribunal hearing. The appellant had claimed to be involved in a Bible smuggling operation and to be targeted by authorities. The Tribunal did not raise with her the specific questions of why she would take the risk of smuggling Bibles when she had a business and an 11 year old dependent child. It relied on these matters in its decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2008] FMCA 23">I do not accept that this reasoning reveals jurisdictional error by reason of a failure at the hearing or otherwise to warn the applicant that the Tribunal might have doubts about this letter and give it no weight. In my opinion, the situation does not fall within the principle applied by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152. As Bennett J said in SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 at [21] : "As the issue was raised for the first time before the Tribunal, the appellant should have been in no doubt that it was an issue arising in relation to the Tribunal's consideration and in relation to the decision under review" . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] FMCA 85">In relation to the argument based on s.425 and SZBEL , I do not consider that the situation falls within the High Court's opinion that s.425 encompasses an obligation on the Tribunal to give an applicant an opportunity to give evidence and make submissions on issues arising in the review before the Tribunal which are not apparent. The present case has no direct parallel with SZBEL , since the Tribunal's finding which is complained of did not concern an issue of credibility which appeared uncontentious in the delegate's decision. In the present case, the applicant first presented his full claims to the Tribunal, and in particular his claim to fear reprisal from individuals in whose arrest he had been involved more than 20 years previously. In my opinion, it should have been apparent to him and his advisers when doing so, that the Tribunal might draw inferences from the absence of any identification of particular persons who were feared, or of incidents or circumstances which suggested that there were particular persons who had an interest in pursuing him after 20 years (compare Bennett J in SZJUB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 at [21] and SZHBX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1169 at [14] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2007] FCA 1984">30 SZBEL [2006] HCA 63 ; 228 CLR 152 has been applied in one or other of the respects mentioned in several cases in this Court, including SZJUB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 ; NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 ; SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 ; and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Applicant A125 of 2003 [2007] FCAFC 162. </sentence>
