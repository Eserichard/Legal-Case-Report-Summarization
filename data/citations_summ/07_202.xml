<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 368">Austal duly obtained preliminary discovery and aided with that discovery brought a further application ( Austal Ships Pty Ltd (ACN 079 160 679) v Thurlow (No 2) [2007] FCA 202). Discovery having been given for Incat and for each of Messrs Thurlow and Merrigan, Austal sought further discovery on 19 October 2006 seeking an order for forensic examination of the electronic databases held by Incat, preservation orders with respect to discovered documents and the examination of ten persons before a Deputy District Registrar of the Court. It abandoned the orders for further discovery and forensic examination but persisted with the application for examination of certain named persons. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1510">33 The applicant relied strongly on the case of Austal Ships Pty Ltd (ACN 079 160 679) v Thurlow (No 2) [2007] FCA 202 as authority for its proposed course of conduct. In that case, French J made orders permitting the examination of a director of nine identified corporate entities as to what the director did after receiving a confidential report because such an examination may enable the applicant to decide whether there was a basis for an action against the corporate entities. The result in that case is consistent with the applicant's contention. However, it appears that French J was not required to deal with submissions on the relationship between O 15A r 3 and r 6 such as those addressed to me. In any event, in light of the findings that I have made below, it is unnecessary for me to determine whether O 15A r 3 permits an examination of a person in the circumstances and for the purposes identified by Ms Trichilo.</sentence>
