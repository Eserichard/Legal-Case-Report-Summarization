<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 910">Criterion A of the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, referred to in DSM-IV, is expressed in terms that are closely reflected in the definition of "experiencing a severe stressor" in the SoP concerning PTSD. The interpretation, based on that definition, by decisions of Full Courts of the Federal Court were conveniently summarised by Heerey J in Repatriation Commission v Norton [2008] FCA 1132 at [20] as follows: 
 "1. The event must be one which 
 
 (i) the person actually perceived as involving actual or threatened death or serious injury and 
 
 (ii) which could reasonably be so perceived by someone with that person's knowledge and experience. There are both subjective and objective elements: Repatriation Commission v Stoddart [2003] FCAFC 300 ; (2003) 134 FCR 392 at [22] , [30]. 
 It is sufficient if a threat is (actually and reasonably) perceived, notwithstanding that there was in fact no threat: Stoddart at [31]. To be "confronted" with the event the person does not necessarily have to be physically present: Woodward v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCAFC 160 ; (2003) 131 FCR 473 at [123] . "Risk" is used in the sense of "an indication of probable evil to come: something that gives indication of causing evil or harm": Stoddart at [36]. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 298">In Repatriation Commission v Constable [2006] FCAFC 102 raised different possibilities of interpreting the definition of experiencing a severe stressor and concluded that the second sub paragraph should be regarded as defining events which, if experienced, qualify as experiencing a severe stressor . Heery J in the decision which gave rise to this matter being remitted namely, Repatriation Commission v Norton [2008] FCA 1132 at [21] drew attention to the word might. By reference to the decision of Repatriation Commission v Stoddart [2003] FCAFC 300 ; (2003) 134 FCR 392 (which affirmed the primary decision of Mansfield J in Stoddart v Repatriation Commission (2003) 197 ALR 283) , the definition of experiencing a severe stressor involves subjective and objective tests of application and the relevant event must also be one which the person (subjectively) perceived as involving a threat of death and which a reasonable person could (objectively) so perceive.  This application is a review of the last decision made by the VRB on 16 November 2006 where it affirmed a decision of the respondent made on 3 November 2005 to reject a claim for acceptance of malignant neoplasm of the liver . This review follows a remittal from Heerey J on 5 August 2008 ( Repatriation Commission v Norton [2008] FCA 1132) where His Honour set aside a decision made by the Tribunal (differently constituted) on 2 January 2008 ( Re Norton and Repatriation Commission [2008] AATA 1). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 658">Criterion A of the diagnostic criteria for PTSD referred to in DSM-IV is expressed in terms that are closely reflected in the definition of "experiencing a severe stressor" in the SoP concerning PTSD. The interpretation based on that definition by decisions of Full Courts of the Federal Court were conveniently summarised by Heerey J in Repatriation Commission v Norton [2008] FCA 1132 at [20] as follows:

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] AATA 1140">It is necessary to consider the material pointing to the clinical onset of Mr Sullivan's anxiety disorder. [42] The term 'clinical onset' requires the manifestation of all symptoms, [43] in the specified degree, frequency or duration, sufficient to satisfy the defined condition. If all of the required symptoms are not present, then the definition cannot be said to be satisfied and 'clinical onset' has not occurred. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] AATA 1099">Relevant case law makes plain, that "clinical onset" and "clinical worsening" are medical issues, requiring diagnostic judgement [18] . The terms refer to the time at which a person's constellation of symptoms is such that a medical practitioner would have diagnosed the particular disease as present or as having worsened [19] . Recent Federal Court decisions emphasise the importance of differentiating the exact nature of the medical condition in issue [20] . There is a tendency with alcohol abuse and dependence to ignore the difference between the two diagnoses. As the Statements of Principles make plain, alcohol abuse can only be diagnosed if "the symptoms have never met the criteria for alcohol dependence". </sentence>
