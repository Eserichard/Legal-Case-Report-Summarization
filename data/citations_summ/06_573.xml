<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 164">14 In this Court, however, the first respondent submitted that there were two other documents that bore on the question, both of which were included in the Court Book filed in the Federal Magistrates Court prior to the hearing of the notice of objection to competency. The first respondent noted that it was nonetheless unclear whether they were part of the evidence before his Honour and invited the Court, if necessary, to receive them into evidence under s 27 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The first respondent referred to CDJ v VAJ (1998) 197 CLR 172 at 201-202 and SZGPB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 573 in support of this course. I will proceed on the assumption that neither of these two documents was tendered in evidence before his Honour. This is consistent with the fact that he did not refer to either document in his judgment.</sentence>
