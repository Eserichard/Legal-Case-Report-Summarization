<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 303">As to the principles pursuant to which leave to proceed against a company in liquidation will be granted, it has been held that the Court's discretion is broad but not absolute, and must be exercised fairly. It can only be exercised if a serious question to be tried is shown ( King v Yurisich [2006] FCA 1369 ; (2006) 59 ACSR [9 - 15]). There is not an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which it may be appropriate for the Court to grant leave to proceed, but they have been said to include factors such as the amount and seriousness of the claim, the degree of complexity of the legal and factual issues involved, and the stage to which the proceedings, if already commenced, may have progressed ( Nommack (No 100) Pty Ltd v FAI Insurances Ltd (in liq) [2003] NSWSC 359 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 215 ; Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd [1983] 1 Qd R 314 [317]).

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 749">Section 471B of the Corporations Act itself is silent as to the principles pursuant to which leave to proceed will be granted: King v Yurisich [2006] FCA 1369 at [13] . The court's discretion is broad but not absolute, and must be exercised fairly. It can only be exercised if a serious question is shown: King v Yurisch [2006] FCA 1369 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 598 at [9] ---[15]; Vagrand Pty Ltd (in liq) v Fielding (1993) 41 FCR 550 at 556. The test which is akin to that of whether there is a "serious question to be tried" as applied in interlocutory injunctions: Vagrand at 556. The authorities have not established an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which it may be appropriate for the Court to grant leave to proceed: Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd [1983] 2 Qd R 314 at 317G per McPherson J (with whom the Court agreed).  Section 471B of the Corporations Act itself is silent as to the principles pursuant to which leave to proceed will be granted: King v Yurisich [2006] FCA 1369 at [13] . The court's discretion is broad but not absolute, and must be exercised fairly.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] NSWSC 517">6 Another preliminary question is whether an appeal is within the purview of s 471B. It is sufficient to say on that that the decision of the Court of Appeal in Skinner v Jeogla Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 15 ; (2001) 37 ACSR 106 indicates that it is and that that view was acted upon by Weinberg J in King v Yurisich [2006] FCA 1369. I should proceed on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] QSC 98">But, like Weinberg J in King v Yurisich [1] , I do not consider it necessary for me to express a concluded view on this matter because, having regard to the circumstances, and particularly the terminal stage of these proceedings, any leave required under s 471B would be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCAFC 51">1 The appellant trustees of the Travel Compensation Fund have applied for an order for the fund's costs both of the trial and the appeal. The application is based on an offer of compromise made by the fund pursuant to O 23 of the Federal Court Rules on 29 August 2003 to Mrs Yurisich (her husband having been made a bankrupt before then), Ms Gottschalk (with whom the fund settled during the trial: see King v Yurisich [2005] FCA 1277 at [31] ) Lane Moller Partners Pty Limited and Mr Young. Only the latter two were party to the appeal. Since we published our primary reasons ( King v Yurisich [2006] FCAFC 136 ; (2006) 153 FCR 78) , Lane Moller has gone into liquidation. Weinberg J gave leave to proceed against Lane Moller for the purposes of the present application ( King v Yurisich [2006] FCA 1369). </sentence>
