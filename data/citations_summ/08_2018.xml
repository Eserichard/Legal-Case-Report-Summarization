<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1413">Pursuant to O 62 r 4(2)(c) the Court may order that, instead of taxed costs, costs be awarded as a gross sum. The purpose of the order is to "save the parties the time, trouble, delay, expense and aggravation in having a taxation proceed on a matter": Keen v Telstra Corp Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 930 at [4]; Nine Films &amp; Television Pty Limited v Ninox Television Limited [2006] FCA 1046 ; Macquarie Bank Ltd v Seagle (2008) 79 IPR 72 ; [2008] FCA 1417 at [30] . The power is not confined and may be exercised whenever the circumstances warrant its exercise: Su v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (No 3) [2008] FCA 2018 at [1] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 392">In Mei Ying Su v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (No 2) [2008] FCA 1485 , 251 ALR 135 at 165, delivered in October 2008, His Honour made an order for costs. A subsequent application was made in December 2008 to then fix a gross sum. His Honour declined to do so: Su v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (No 3) [2008] FCA 2018. The dearth of material upon which the application was based, however, made it unnecessary for His Honour to discuss any generally expressed principle.
