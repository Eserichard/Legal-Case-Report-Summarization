<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 379">In BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 404 at [63] ---[66], I endeavoured to summarise the relevant authorities as to the meaning of "genuine dispute" for the purposes of s 459H(1)(a) of the Act. I said: For s 459H(1)(a) to be engaged, the Court must be satisfied that there is a genuine dispute about the existence or about the amount of the debt. In order for a dispute of that kind to be raised, there must be more than the mere assertion of a dispute or the mere making of a claim (per Lindgren J in Rohalo Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd v RP Scherer SpA &amp; Pharmagel SpA (1994) 15 ACSR 347 , (1994) 13 ACLC 94 at 352/30---354/15, esp at 353/20---25).</sentence>

The dispute must have an objective existence the genuineness of which is capable of being assessed ( Rohalo 15 ACSR 347 , 13 ACLC 94 at 353/17---25).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 186">The facts are summarised in the judgment of the federal magistrate. The summary is largely derived, as his Honour acknowledged, from the judgment of Foster J in BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Ltd (No. 2) [2009] FCA 404 , which was upheld by the Full Court in Watts v Adelaide Bank Limited [2009] FCAFC 169. It is convenient to reproduce the summary as none of the facts included in it is disputed. 
 
 [5] In short, the Bank lent money to BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd ("BMG") under two loan agreements entered into in 2004. Moreover, the statement that it was the bank that did not allow the matter to proceed to contract is wrong. This was a matter considered in the proceeding before Foster J: BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Ltd (No. 2) [2009] FCA 404 [23]-[33]. The federal magistrate observed: 
 
 [48] ...[T]he evidence before Foster J showed that the prospective purchaser, Mr Campbell, never became willing to execute an agreement to purchase the property at that price, in circumstances which are set out in the judgment of Foster J from [23]-[33]. Counsel for the Bank also pointed out that there was a caveat on the title at the time of Mr and Mrs Watts' negotiations with Mr Campbell, which it appears neither Mr Watts nor the Bank was able or willing to remove to allow the proposed contract to be attractive to Mr Campbell at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1013">The application to set aside the statutory demand on BMG, referred to in the FMC reasons at [9], was heard in this Court by Foster J who declined to set aside the statutory demand in a judgment delivered on 24 April 2009: BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 404. In that proceeding, BMG and Mr and Mrs Watts contended, amongst other things, that they had offsetting claims against the respondent exceeding the amount claimed in the statutory demand, based on an allegation that the respondent had sold the Drummoyne property at an undervalue. Foster J considered this contention in his reasons for judgment at [85]-[90] and concluded that it was without merit. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 623">The outstanding application to set aside the statutory demand on BMG was heard by Foster J on 10 December 2008, and his Honour gave judgment on 24 April 2009 (see BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 404). Foster J set out the history of the matter up to that time, including extracts from the reasoning of the Supreme Court justices, before explaining his reasons for declining to set aside the demand.  The indebtedness of Mr and Mrs Watts to the Bank arises in circumstances which have been detailed in several previous judgments. In particular, I would gratefully adopt the recitation of the background found in the judgment of Foster J in BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 404. </sentence>

 JUDGES: LINDGREN, GILMOUR AND JAGOT JJ DATE: 3 DECEMBER 2009 PLACE: SYDNEY 

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 THE COURT: 
 
 BACKGROUND 
 
1 These reasons for judgment relate to two appeals against decisions of single judges of this Court. 2 The first decision, BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 404 , is that of Foster J delivered on 24 April 2009. Foster J dismissed an application by BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd ( BMG ) to set aside a creditor's statutory demand for payment of a debt dated 21 August 2007 and which the Adelaide Bank ( the Bank ) had served on BMG ( the statutory demand ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 420">Secondly, Foster J has recently examined the facts and circumstances which led to the default judgment and the sale of the property ( BMG v Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 404). His Honour traced the course of events in detail. It is not necessary that I should do so again. In any event, his Honour apparently had the benefit of a much more detailed explanation of the facts than has been attempted before me. His Honour rejected an application to set aside a statutory demand made against BMG which was founded on the judgment entered on 3 April 2006. His Honour rejected arguments which were, in substance, to the same effect as the first contention advanced in the present proceedings. </sentence>
