<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] SAIRC 61">Understandably the appellant felt compelled to address the first point given that subsequent to its discontinuance of the purported appeal to the Federal Court, Mansfield J expressed a view on the issue contrary to the position taken by the appellant. Mansfield J considered that there was a reasonable basis to conclude that the Magistrate's decision as to the industrial instruments applicable to the respondent's employment was intended to and did operate as a final and binding judicial determination of an issue of principle, and thus was potentially capable of appeal as a "judgment" under s 853(1) of the WRA. [22]  As a result, Mansfield J dismissed the appeal on that day without hearing argument from the parties on whether there had been a "judgment" or not. He subsequently published reasons for judgment on an application by the respondent for costs with respect to the discontinued appeal. In those reasons he expressed the view that, contrary to the position ultimately adopted by the appellant on its own appeal, there was a reasonable basis to conclude that the Magistrate had intended to and did deliver a "judgment" within the meaning of that word in s 853(1) of the WRA. [12] 
  In our view the conclusion is irresistible that the Magistrate, in deciding on which of the two awards in question applied to the respondent's employment, was also deciding on the application of the related NAPSAs. A proper reading of his conclusion is that it relates to the whole of the claim, including that period covered by a NAPSA, and that quantum and interest were considered to be the only remaining issues. We note that Mansfield J came to the same view when making his comments on the scope of the decision for the purposes of the "judgment" issue. He felt that the Magistrate's conclusion, whilst referring only to the Clerks Award, was a shorthand way of saying that over the period in dispute, the respondent should have been paid as a Level 2 Clerk under the Clerks Award and then under the NAPSA.
