<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 182">The solicitors did not misconstrue his instructions, nor did they wrongly file the application for dismissal. [6] It can be assumed that they simply adopted a cautious approach, given the then evidence, and Mr Novosel acted on their advice. Accordingly, as there was no factual or legal error in the Tribunal's dismissal of Mr Novosel's appeal in December 2009, the Tribunal discounts any suggestion that the application should be reinstated. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 138">The Tribunal's discretion is conditional upon the application having been dismissed in error. The error need not be an administrative error on the part of the Tribunal: Goldie supra . However, unless the dismissal of the application can be shown to have been attended with error, the Tribunal has no power to reinstate an application under section 42A(10) of the AAT Act : Goldie at [41], [42], [77]; SZLIO v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2008] FCA 124. 31. S42A(7) of the AAT Act provides that:
 
 
 Before exercising its powers under subsection (2), the Tribunal must be satisfied that appropriate notice was given to the person who failed to appear of the time and place of the directions hearing, conference, mediation or hearing as the case may be.</sentence>
