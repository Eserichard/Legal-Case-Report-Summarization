<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 865">I have in mind here that whilst the immediate parties to the application are those with the most interest in the matter, the body of creditors generally also have an interest and I cannot be certain one way or the other about the position of solvency. It may be most unfortunate if a bankruptcy notice were set aside in circumstances where the debtor is in fact insolvent.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 523">Before the appeal was heard it became necessary for Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith to apply to the Court to set aside a further bankruptcy notice which had been issued against them by the creditor. In order to understand the way in which this came about it is necessary to go back in history for a short time. On 26 October 2000 the creditor had obtained a certificate of the taxed costs in the High Court. The amount allowed was $5,528.27. Five and a half years later the Official Receiver issued a bankruptcy notice on the application of the creditor based on that certificate. On 3 July 2006 Jacobson J set aside that bankruptcy notice as an abuse of process ( Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall Pty Limited, in the matter of Maxwell-Smith (2006) 233 ALR 81 ; [2006] FCA 825) as he was satisfied that the "purpose in issuing the bankruptcy notice was to put pressure on Mrs Maxwell-Smith to pay the debt rather than to genuinely invoke the Court's bankruptcy jurisdiction" (at [45]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 819">It was contended that the email suggested that within the context of the negotiations that had been going on between the parties for some months the purpose of the creditor's bankruptcy notice was to put pressure on the debtor to pay a debt and to "hand over his head" rather than to genuinely invoke the court's jurisdiction in relation to insolvency, that being merely the creditor's secondary purpose; Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall Pty Limited [2006] FCA 825 at [45] --- [52]. To like effect the observations of Emmett J in Max Bernard Jules Brunninghausen v Michael Glavanics [1998] FCA 230 where His Honour noted: "...If it is apparent that the purpose of a bankruptcy notice is to put pressure on a debtor to pay a debt rather than to invoke the court's jurisdiction in relation to insolvency, then the filing of a bankruptcy notice is an abusive process. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 668">The applicants argue that the issue of this bankruptcy notice is an abuse of process and that the Court has power under s.30 of the Act to set aside a bankruptcy notice that could be so characterised; Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 825 ; (2006) 233 ALR 81 at [41] - [42] per Jacobson J; Kossaifi v Eakin &amp; Ors [2010] FMCA 102 at [25] per Barnes FM. It is not appropriate to utilise bankruptcy proceedings to compel a recalcitrant debtor who is otherwise solvent to pay a debt which he declines to pay; Slack v Bottoms English Solicitors [2002] FCA 1445 ; Re Sarina; Ex Parte Council of the Shire of Wollondilly [1980] FCA 66 ; (1980) 43 FLR 163 (" Re Sarina ") at 165; Brunninghausen v Glavanics [1988] FCA 230. In his helpful written submissions, Mr Svehla sets out at [76] a history of the proceedings between the Rankines and the applicant liquidators. The history is lengthy. It commences on page 24 of the written submissions and continues to page 30. The proceedings are ongoing because the applicants as liquidators are seeking to overturn the arrangements whereby the assets of Nielson &amp; Moller found their way to Southern Cross. My reading of the history as set out in the written submissions which are filed with the papers, the affidavit of Mr McInnes and the documentation annexed thereto is that the respondents are intent on resisting the actions of these officers of the Court. My reading of the history and the correspondence leads me to believe that the request to the official receiver to issue a bankruptcy notice against the liquidators was not so much to secure payment from recalcitrant debtors but to embarrass them. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 102">It was not disputed that this court has power under s.30 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) to set aside a bankruptcy notice that could be characterised as an abuse of process (see Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall Pty Ltd (2006) 233 ALR 81 ; [2006] FCA 825 at [41] --- [42]). However, as Jacobson J stated in Maxwell-Smith at [41], the Bankruptcy Act : ... confers no general discretion to set aside a bankruptcy notice that is valid in form and not an abuse of process. </sentence>

19. The ground of "abuse of process" for setting aside a bankruptcy notice has support in authority, including the judgment of Emmett J in Brunninghausen v Glavanics [1998] FCA 230 and the judgment of Jacobson J in Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 825. In the latter, Jacobson J said:
 
 [41] The court's power to set aside a bankruptcy notice arises from s 30 of the Act. But the Act confers no general discretion to set aside a bankruptcy notice that is valid in form and not an abuse of process: Re Briggs; Ex Parte Briggs v DCT (1986) 12 FCR 310 at 311-12; 75 ALR 554 at 556; Re Athans; Ex Parte Athans (1991) 29 FCR 302 at 310; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Forge (2003) 133 FCR 487 ; 48 ACSR 474 ; [2003] FCAFC 274 at [27] .</sentence>

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 601">I have in mind here that whilst the immediate parties to the application are those with the most interest in the matter, the body of creditors generally also have an interest and I cannot be certain one way or the other about the position of solvency. It may be most unfortunate if a bankruptcy notice were set aside in circumstances where the debtor is in fact insolvent. 

 
By way of example, in Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 825 , 233 ALR 81 Jacobson J was prepared to infer that the purpose in issuing a bankruptcy notice was to put pressure on the debtor rather than to genuinely invoke the court's bankruptcy jurisdiction in circumstances where the bankruptcy notice sought payment of a debt for a small amount based on a judgment debt which was over 5 years old; where the judgment creditor was aware of the probability of solvency; and where the judgment debtor owned assets which greatly exceeded the debt.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 1214">In Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 825 ; (2006) 233 ALR 81 Jacobson J summarised the evidence leading to an inference that the bankruptcy notice was an abuse of process, saying: [45] In my view, it is to be inferred from the factual matrix set out above that S &amp; E Hall's purpose in issuing the bankruptcy notice was to put pressure on Mrs Maxwell-Smith to pay the debt rather than to genuinely invoke the Court's bankruptcy jurisdiction. This inference arises from the following. [46] First, the bankruptcy notice seeks payment of a debt for a small amount of money based on a judgment debt which is over 5 years old. No satisfactory explanation has been given as to why the notice was issued after such a lengthy delay. It is true that the debt is not statute barred, but the right to pursue it by invoking the Court's processes must be subject to the operation of the principles respecting abuse of process; Batistatos at [62] --- [65]. [47] Second, the observations made by Moore J in July 2004 make it plain that S &amp; E Hall was aware at that time of the probability that Mrs Maxwell-Smith was solvent. [48] Third, the letter from S &amp; E Hall's solicitors states in unequivocal terms that Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith owned assets the value of which greatly exceeded their debts. In my view it is clear from this letter that S &amp; E Hall was aware of Mrs Maxwell-Smith's ability to meet her liabilities in August 2004.  In Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 825 ; (2006) 233 ALR 81 Jacobson J said: [43] If it is apparent to the Court that the purpose of a bankruptcy notice is to put pressure on a debtor to pay a debt, rather than to invoke the Court's insolvency jurisdiction, the issuing of the bankruptcy notice will be an abuse of process; Brunninghausen v Glavanics [1998] FCA 230 ; see also Re Sarina; Ex parte Wollondilly Shire Council [1980] FCA 66 ; (1980) 43 FLR 163 at 166. </sentence>
