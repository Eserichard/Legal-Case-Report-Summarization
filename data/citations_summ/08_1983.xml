<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 196">I have had the benefit of very helpful submissions from senior counsel for both the State and Sportsbet Pty Ltd (Sportsbet). The general principles applicable to a claim for public interest immunity at this stage of the proceeding are the common law principles: Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 ; Queanbeyan City Council v ACTEW Corporation Ltd [2008] FCA 1983 ; (2008) 253 ALR 121 at [7] per Stone J. Those principles are conveniently set out in the reasons for judgment of McLellan CJ in Murrumbidgee Ground-Water Preservation Association v Minister for Natural Resources [2003] NSWLEC 322 at [19] , and by Jagot J in Betfair Pty Ltd v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140 ; (2009) 181 FCR 66. In determining the claim for public interest immunity, the Court may inspect the documents in issue, although as a starting point it is not routinely done. As was said in Commonwealth v Northern Land Council (1991) 30 FCR 1 at 36-37, the Court should conduct a "kind of anticipatory balancing exercise" to decide whether a document should be inspected. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 922">While the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) by s 130 permits a Court to admit into evidence information and documents that relate to matters of state if the public interest in doing so outweighs the interest in preserving the secrecy or confidentiality in the information or documents, this provision does not apply in interlocutory proceedings such as these: Queanbeyan City Council v ACTEW Corporation Ltd [2008] FCA 1983 ; (2008) 253 ALR 121 , [7] per Stone J. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider the issue on general law principles. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] VSCA 250">[140] 
234 It was the contention of the Minister, that an analysis of the proportionality of the five per cent contribution would require consideration of the cost and effect of all subdivisions within the municipality and not merely the particular subdivision in issue.</sentence>
