<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 916">31 I have separately addressed the claims for gross sum costs orders by the defendants (some of the Commonwealth respondents) in matters ACD 31 of 1997 and 32 of 1997. I have made orders at the same time as this order, fixing the defendants costs in a gross sum: see Dunstan v Seymour [2006] FCA 917 The reasons for those orders indicate why I do not accept that the process of taxation of costs to date in those matters results in uncertainty about quantifying the necessary or proper costs so that gross sum orders for costs should be made.</sentence>
