<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] AATA 1918">I would not reach a different view if I had regard to the extrinsic material, including the second reading speech accompanying the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act 1990 (which amended the National Health Act 1953 ) and the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement between the Pharmacy Guild and the Commonwealth. That material suggests the rules are "directed...to maintaining the desired pharmacy network": Sayegh v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority [2006] FCA 1289 at [30] . Clause 25 of the Fourth Agreement sets out specific objectives of the location rules. These include ensuring: 
 
 ... 
 (b) a commercially viable and sustainable network of community pharmacies dispensing PBS medicines; 
 (c) improved efficiency through increased competition between pharmacies; 
 ... 
 (f) continued development of an effective, efficient and well-distributed community pharmacy network in Australia.

 "No doubt there is a presumption that where the same word is used on more than one occasion in a section it is intended to have the same meaning in each case, but this is not a presumption of very much weight; there is no rigid rule; it all depends on the context. " (Citations omitted)
