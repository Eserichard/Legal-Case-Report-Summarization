<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 247">"The Tribunal is not required to address every piece of evidence before it, provided that it considers the integers of the claim": Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at 342 [79] per Allsop J with whom Heerey J agreed. But as French, Sackville and Hely JJ observed in Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs at [47] (supra) : 
 "The inference that the Tribunal has failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure expressly to deal with that issue in its reasons. But that is an inference not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point". 
 
However, the Court found:
 
 "It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected. Where, however, there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the Tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked". Toro Martinez v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 528 per Rares J at [46]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 39">25 The respondent, an Australian Building and Construction Inspector appointed under s 57 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (the Act ), brought proceedings in the Federal Court and, against each appellant, was successful in obtaining declarations of three contraventions of s 43 of the Act: Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) [2009] FCA 52 (the liability judgment ).  3 It is convenient to repeat the primary judge's findings about what occurred on 15 and 17 February 2006. As to 15 February 2006, her Honour said in the liability judgment ([2009] FCA 52 at [33]):
 Having regard to the evidence and s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), I find that, at the meeting of 15 February 2006, Mr Mates made demands on Mr Goss that Mr Deans, Mr O'Donnell and Ms Singleton be re-employed at the Mount Street site, and that Mr Deans and Mr O'Donnell be appointed as shop stewards and Ms Singleton be appointed as OH&amp;S officer. All three individuals had previously been employed at the Mount Street site. Further, I find that Mr Mates threatened trouble at the site and that the project was "not going to happen" if his demands were not met. These threats constituted threatening to take action with intent to coerce Hardcorp to employ these three persons on the project at Mount Street and, amongst other things, to allocate to Ms Singleton the responsibilities or duties of OH&amp;S officer on the project as it recommenced. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 48">The prior contraventions by Mr Mates of the BCII Act are contraventions of s 43 of the BCII Act arising out of conduct on: 15, 17 and 21 February 2006; Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) [2009] FCA 52 (contraventions recorded 5 February 2009); and 31 July 2006; Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 223 (contraventions recorded 13 March 2009). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1040">The Court has found that Bob Mates, in his own right, and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, through Mr Mates' conduct, contravened s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) on 15 February 2006, 17 February 2006 and 21 February 2006. The Court has previously made declarations of contravention that reflect these findings: see Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) [2009] FCA 52.  I am unable to accept the respondents' submissions, although I accept that there was no evidence that Mr Mates was aware of the appointment of an OH&amp;S representative before or at the 17 February 2006 meeting. In particulars under paragraph [17] of their Defence, Amended Defence and Further Amended Defence, the respondents had stated that, on 21 February at the site, "Mates raised safety concerns with a crane operator". There was, however, no evidence that Mr Mates raised any concerns about safety at the meetings on 15 and 17 February 2006, as one might have expected if safety had been a genuine motivating concern on Mr Mates' part. In the context explained in my earlier judgment, Mr Mates himself gave no evidence: see Cahill v CFMEU (No 3) [2009] FCA 52 at [2] - [6]. The Court has, moreover, found that there was no evidence to support a suggestion that safety concerns motivated Mr Mates' conduct on 21 February 2006: see Cahill v CFMEU (No 3) [2009] FCA 52 at [82] . Indeed, the Court held (at [83]) that there was no reasonable explanation for Mr Mates' conduct after Mr Moresi informed him that Mr Van Senten was shop steward and OH&amp;S representative and that: 
 
 The only tenable explanation is that Mr Mates was carrying out his threats of 15 and 17 February 2006 that the project at Mount Street would not recommence unless Mr Deans, Mr O'Donnell and Ms Singleton were re-employed and took on their former responsibilities, including that Ms Singleton assumed OH&amp;S responsibilities. 
 
  Mr Palmer's evidence allowed for the fact that, notwithstanding there was no crane, employees undertook some work on the site until late February 2006. This is borne out by the video taken on 24 February 2006, to which the respondents referred: see also Cahill v CFMEU (No 3) [2009] FCA 52 at [105] . The effect of his evidence is that, after Mr Mates shut down the crane until late February 2006, there was some limited non-crane dependent work undertaken on the site, but thereafter, no productive work could be undertaken without a crane.  It is not, moreover, apparent how interest is quantified and paid. Mr Goss's statements about subsequent losses are equally imprecise and, in any event, are subject to the conclusion expressed at paragraph [37] above. Furthermore, it is to be borne in mind that the Court has already found that Mr Goss was not an entirely reliable witness: see Cahill v CFMEU (No 3) [2009] FCA 52 [30], [55], [104] and [109]. In the end, I conclude that the actual loss suffered by Transit Joint Venture on 21 February 2006 was a good deal less than the claimed $50,000.  The following discussion of the nature and extent of the unlawful conduct derives from findings previously made and recorded: see Cahill v CFMEU (No 3) [2009] FCA 52 at [33] , [37], [56], [58], [79], [83], [85] and [86]. The following is a summary of what is discussed in greater detail in this earlier judgment.  I am unable to accept the respondents' submissions, although I accept that there was no evidence that Mr Mates was aware of the appointment of an OH&amp;S representative before or at the 17 February 2006 meeting. In particulars under paragraph [17] of their Defence, Amended Defence and Further Amended Defence, the respondents had stated that, on 21 February at the site, "Mates raised safety concerns with a crane operator". There was, however, no evidence that Mr Mates raised any concerns about safety at the meetings on 15 and 17 February 2006, as one might have expected if safety had been a genuine motivating concern on Mr Mates' part. In the context explained in my earlier judgment, Mr Mates himself gave no evidence: see Cahill v CFMEU (No 3) [2009] FCA 52 at [2] - [6]. The Court has, moreover, found that there was no evidence to support a suggestion that safety concerns motivated Mr Mates' conduct on 21 February 2006: see Cahill v CFMEU (No 3) [2009] FCA 52 at [82] . Indeed, the Court held (at [83]) that there was no reasonable explanation for Mr Mates' conduct after Mr Moresi informed him that Mr Van Senten was shop steward and OH&amp;S representative and that: 
 
 The only tenable explanation is that Mr Mates was carrying out his threats of 15 and 17 February 2006 that the project at Mount Street would not recommence unless Mr Deans, Mr O'Donnell and Ms Singleton were re-employed and took on their former responsibilities, including that Ms Singleton assumed OH&amp;S responsibilities. 
 
  Some care must be taken in assessing the effect of Mr Mates' action. It must be borne steadily in mind that the Court has rejected as unproven the applicant's allegations of further contraventions on the respondents' part in respect of conduct after the crane left the site on 21 February 2006. That is, the Court has rejected as unproven the applicant's allegations that: (1) Mr Mates telephoned the Union's offices or a representative of the Union to instruct Mr Hill to ring Sergi Cranes and other crane operators to warn them off working at the Mount Street site; and (2) Mr Mates arranged for Mr Tadic and/or Mr Hill to contact Independent Cranes to ensure that the crane left the Mount Street site and did not return: see Cahill v CFMEU (No 3) [2009] FCA 52 [96]. The Court also rejected as unproven the allegation that from 22 February 2006 Mr Mates organised the picket outside the Mount Street site.  As it happened, Mr Mates' action on 21 February 2006 was compounded by the fact that Hardcorp was unable to secure another crane to work on the site until 2 March 2006: see Cahill v CFMEU (No 3) [2009] FCA 52 at [99] . Plainly enough, this failure significantly affected the progress of the project. Mr Palmer deposed that he ceased work at Mount Street on 3 March 2006 and that: 
 
 The Mount Street site had basically shut down at this stage. There was no productive work which could be done on the Mount Street site at this time because we could not get the crane crew on the Mount Street site. By late February 2006 we had already exhausted every other piece of work that the employees could do on the Mount Street site in the absence of a crane. By this stage we could not get any further progress payments made to us because we could not do any productive work. 
 

Mr Palmer's evidence was corroborated by Mr McMahon. Again, I accept Mr Palmer's evidence as to the situation at Mount Street as at 3 March 2006. </sentence>

In each of the above instances, the Union was found to have contravened the provision or provisions referred to. In addition, in the most recent instance (that of February 2006), Mr Mates was found to have contravened the provision referred to.</sentence>
