<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 186">His Honour was entitled to have regard to evidence about the Court practice as part of the circumstances surrounding the making of the order; " part of the 'factual matrix', the 'objective setting' or, to use the contemporary interpretative formula, the 'context' (cf. Ho v Grigor [2006] FCA 417 at [29] ) " in which the order is to be construed: Nokia Corporation v Liu [2009] FCAFC 138 ; (2009) 179 FCR 422 at 430 [29]- [31]. Nokia Corporation was concerned with consent orders but the bank submitted that the same principles apply to the construction of an ex parte order and Mr and Mrs Watts did not argue otherwise. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 138">31 The particular consent orders in this matter were not accompanied by, and did not give expression to, reasons for judgment: on the significance of reasons in construing court orders, see Athens , at [129] ff. Nonetheless, as is apparent on their face, the orders draw meaning both from the Application and Statement of Claim filed in the proceedings and from evidence filed in support of the proceedings. As we will indicate below, they also are informed by well accepted practices adopted in trademark infringement litigation. These last, in our view, constitute part of the "factual matrix", the "objective setting" or, to use the contemporary interpretative formula, the "context" (cf Ho v Grigor [2006] FCA 417 at [29] ) in which the consent orders are to be construed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCAFC 72">33 The motions were returnable on 5 April 2006 and on 19 April 2006 his Honour made the following orders in the two matters --- Ho v Grigor [2006] FCA 417: 
 
 '1. Set aside Order 3 made by me on 3 December 2004.
