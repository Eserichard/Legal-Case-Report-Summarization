<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 299">It is well established law that pain resulting from activities in employment may be consistent with an injury for the purposes of the SRC Act even though no pathological change takes place [51] . Under the SRC Act the concept of suffering an aggravation injury is not confined to a condition being made worse, but may also include the condition becoming worse if the worsening is significantly contributed to by the employment [52] . An aggravation injury may be temporary in effect, but so long as the injury produces effects in addition to the underlying condition and those additional effects do not come to an end, compensation may be payable [53] ; the contrary holds where the effects of the injury cease even though the effects of the underlying condition may persist [54] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] AATA 248">Under the SRC Act 'aggravation' is defined to include acceleration or recurrence. It is well established that aggravation is synonymous with exacerbation, in the sense that the ailment is made worse [64] or the experience of the ailment is " increased or intensified by an increase or intensifying of symptoms " [65] --- " Neither the absence of change in the underlying condition nor the temporary nature of the symptoms experienced preclude the existence of an aggravation of an ailment for the purposes of the SRC Act " [66] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWWCCPD 160">It is clear that symptoms or pain brought on by work activity may constitute a relevant aggravation even though no pathological change in the underlying condition has occurred. ( Commonwealth of Australia v Beattie [1981] FCA 88 ; (1981) 35 ALR 369). What is necessary is to decide whether the manifestation of symptoms is sufficient to establish 'injury', or, in other words, whether the symptoms were made worse by the work duties described. ( Mellor v Australian Postal Corporation [2009] FCA 504). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 863">The applicant's position is that she did not suffer from pain before performing computer-based work with her employer. Mr Anforth, counsel for the applicant, contended that the applicant need not suffer constant pain in order for the condition to be regarded as an injury. Fluctuating pain is sufficient. Mr Anforth further contended that the applicant had an injury in 2003 that occurred at her workplace, but no claim was made for this injury. The injury was aggravated in 2006 due to her workplace (the aggravation being the subject of this claim). Mr Anforth said that even if other factors such as depression and bullying contributed to the applicant's condition and her perception of pain, the evidence of the applicant, supported by medical evidence, was that her work materially contributed to her condition. Mr Anforth relied on the evidence of Associate Professor Cohen and the decision of the Federal Court in Mellor v Australian Postal Corporation [2009] FCA 504 .
