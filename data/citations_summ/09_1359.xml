<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1231">The relevant principles may be summarised as follows: The power of the Court to appoint a receiver is statutory (see ss 23 and 57 of the FCA and s 1323 of the Act) but has its origins as an equitable remedy: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 6) [2006] FCA 1825 at [71] ; In addition to the powers given to receivers by s 420 of the Act, the Court has the power to authorise a receiver to do any act or thing which the parties might do: see O 26 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules . Examples include investing the receiver with power to conduct legal proceedings and to appoint lawyers to act ( Gray (No 6) , to settle such proceedings ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Letten (No 6) [2010] FCA 1048) or to enter into formal agreements by deed ( Parker Re Purcom No 34 Pty Ltd (in Liq) [2009] FCA 1359 ; (2009) 262 ALR 85) ; The circumstances in which the Court may exercise its power to appoint receivers, and the conditions which may be attached to that appointment, are not closed: Gray (No 6) at [71]. As explained by French J in Gray (No 6) : 
 
 
 There may be many circumstances of considerable diversity which would warrant such an order and it is important that the discretion not be unnecessarily confined by any particular line of cases to which it has been applied. 
 
 

 The power to appoint a receiver must carry with it an implied power to give directions with respect to the discharge of the functions for which the appointment is made: Mariconte v Batiste [2000] NSWSC 288 ; (2000) 48 NSWLR 724 at [75] per Austin J. The function of the Court on an application for directions from Court appointed receivers is analogous to its function with respect to a provisional liquidator: Mariconte at [76] citing Sanderson v Classic Car Insurances Pty Ltd (1985) 10 ACLR 115 and Law Society of New South Wales v Milios [1999] NSWSC 1272 ; (1999) 48 NSWLR 409. It is appropriate for the Court to give directions that provide guidance to the receivers on matters of law and on the reasonableness of the contemplated exercise of discretion: Mariconte at [76]. However, such directions should not be given where the answer to the question would require the Court to make or to condone a particular commercial judgment: Re One.Tel Networks Holdings Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 1065 ; (2001) 40 ACSR 83 at [32] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 263">On 19 November 2009, Ngan, in his capacity as the receiver of Purcom, applied to the Court for approval to enter, and an order approving entry, into a Supply Deed with JAX Quickfit. The Court granted Ngan the approval subject to Ngan serving the Orders on Tucker Senior and Admin: Parker, In the Matter of Purcom No 34 Pty Limited (In Liq) (ACN 006 794 672) [2009] FCA 1359 ; (2009) 262 ALR 85. On 25 November 2009, service on Tucker Senior and Admin was effected. </sentence>
