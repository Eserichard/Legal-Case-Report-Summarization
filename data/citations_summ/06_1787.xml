The observations which his Honour made in that case are reminiscent of the statements made by the Full Court in Jupiters [2005] FCAFC 90 ; 222 ALR 155 , 65 IPR 86 , AIPC 92-098 and need not be set out in full here.

In the course of that, his Honour referred to a text in the following terms (at [74]):
 
In the Encyclopedia of United Kingdom and European Patent Law (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Limited, 1977---2007), footnote 3 on page 1109 includes the following: 
 
 
 "It has, for instance, been held that publication of the existence of an "optically active" compound is not publication of the separated optically active forms, even though any chemist would appreciate that they must exist and could be prepared: I.C.I. (1971) unrep. (No.</sentence>

In neither case was there the express reference to enantiomers such as there is in the French and corresponding patents here. The priority dates of the relevant patents are also interesting when compared with the priority dates in issue here. In Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 , the priority date of the broader patent was 30 May 1986 and that of the enantiomer patent 21 July 1989. In the case of Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 the Australian Citalopram Patent had a priority date of 14 January 1976 and the enantiomer patent 14 June 1988. The common general knowledge found by Lindgren J to relate to the enantiomer patent and by Young J to relate to the broader patent was very much in the same time band as that relevant to construction of the patent in suit here. Naturally, the field of each invention is somewhat different but the principles of stereochemistry as they were understood at the time should not have varied much. There is no suggestion of any crucial and widely known developments during the years in question.  70 A little earlier than the decision in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 , Young J had considered a similar issue in Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner-Lambert Co LLC (No 2) [2006] FCA 1787 , (2006) 71 IPR 46. One question was whether the formula in claim 1 of the relevant patent claimed only the racemate and not the enantiomers separate from the racemate. The patentee, Warner-Lambert, called, amongst other witnesses, Professor Christopher Easton and Professor Peter Scammells, who gave evidence for Sanofi-Aventis in these cases. 
 

71 His Honour found that the formula did include claims for the enantiomers as such, notwithstanding that there was no reference to them. An important part of his reasoning was as follows ( Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 at [121] ---[122] and [128]---[129]): 
 "Perhaps the most important background consideration against which the claims of the 981 Patent must be construed is that the skilled addressee would know that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, such as the class of compounds referred to in claim 1, are enantiomeric and that one enantiomer is very likely to be more active than the other. The skilled addressee would also know that the biological activity of a racemate will be different from that of the single enantiomers, and that the active or more active enantiomer will be approximately twice as active as the racemate. In these circumstances, confronted by a structural formula in claim 1 that shows relative stereochemistry, the skilled reader would consider that the structural formula was intended to claim both enantiomers, as well as racemic mixtures. 73 Although the decisions in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 and Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 turned in large measure upon the evidence in each case, a difference in approach can be detected on the question involving the disclosure of enantiomers, with Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 favourable to the applicants on this issue, and Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 being neutral. In neither case was there the express reference to enantiomers such as there is in the French and corresponding patents here. The priority dates of the relevant patents are also interesting when compared with the priority dates in issue here. In Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 , the priority date of the broader patent was 30 May 1986 and that of the enantiomer patent 21 July 1989. In the case of Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 the Australian Citalopram Patent had a priority date of 14 January 1976 and the enantiomer patent 14 June 1988. The common general knowledge found by Lindgren J to relate to the enantiomer patent and by Young J to relate to the broader patent was very much in the same time band as that relevant to construction of the patent in suit here. Naturally, the field of each invention is somewhat different but the principles of stereochemistry as they were understood at the time should not have varied much. There is no suggestion of any crucial and widely known developments during the years in question.  The patentee, Warner-Lambert, called, amongst other witnesses, Professor Christopher Easton and Professor Peter Scammells, who gave evidence for Sanofi-Aventis in these cases. The applicant for revocation, Ranbaxy, called, inter alia, Dr Keith Watson, who was called by Apotex, one of the applicants, in these cases. His Honour's findings about common general knowledge (so far as is relevant) were as follows ( Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 at [113] ):
 
 
 "(7) The biological activity of a racemate in a biological system can be quite different from that of a single enantiomer. The physical and biological properties of a racemate differ from that of an individual enantiomer in various respects: for example, there may be differences in solubility between the racemate and its enantiomers and differences in pharmacological properties. (8) The normal expectation is that there would be one enantiomer that is approximately twice as active as the racemate in terms of its operation in the target biological system. 133 Here, there is no suggestion that any of the process claims do not work in that sense and there is no suggestion that the compounds claimed do not usefully inhibit platelet aggregation. Indeed, it has not been contended that the compounds claimed are not better in that respect than the racemate. I do not see that the claims that the properties were "unexpected" or "surprising" have anything to do with that concept. The decision of Young J in Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 must have been based upon the view that the specification there was construed as promising a particular level of result. The correctness of the decision on this point was left open in the Full Court ( Ranbaxy [2008] FCAFC 82 at [142] ---[144]).

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 559">Obviousness is perhaps the most critical aspect of the Revocation Proceeding (and the Arrow Proceeding). This appears to be the first time an Australian patent relating to a single enantiomer has been challenged on the ground of obviousness (the obviousness ground was abandoned in Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner-Lambert Company LLC (No 2) [2006] FCA 1787 ; (2006) 71 IPR 46 ( Ranbaxy ) as noted by Young J at [15]). </sentence>
