<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWCA 220">7 The applicant's appeal to the Federal Court was dismissed: Klewer v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (No 2) [2008] FCA 1788. Her application for special leave to appeal to the High Court was dismissed by Hayne and Crennan JJ on 5 August 2009. Their Honours observed that there was no reason to doubt the correctness of the decisions made by the courts below.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 53">106 Ms George contends that there is a testamentary trust that she effected by way of her will over the Moggill property to take effect while she was still alive. If Ms George's intention was to create a testamentary trust, even if the will were in writing, this would not give rise to any legal or equitable right on the part of her son while Ms George remains alive. As Bennett J said in Klewer v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (No 2) [2008] FCA 1788 at [50] :
 ...A 'beneficiary under [a] will derives, while the testator remains alive, no legal or equitable right or title from the will: all the beneficiary has is the prospect of acquiring a right or title if the testator dies in the lifetime of the prospective beneficiary without revoking or altering the will' (Meagher, Heydon and Leeming, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity: Doctrines &amp; Remedies (4th ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, 2002) at [6-190]). As was stated Re Parsons; Stockley v Parsons (1890) 45 Ch D 51 , at 55, per Kay J (approved in Ogden Industries Pty Limited v Lucas [1968] UKPCHCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 32 , at 37): It is indisputable law that no one can have any estate or interest, at law or in equity, contingent or other, in the property of a living person to which he hopes to succeed as heir at law or next of kin of such living person. During the life of such person no one can have more than a spes successionis, an expectation or hope of succeeding to his property. </sentence>
