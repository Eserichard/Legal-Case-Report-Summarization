<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 69">His Honour went on to observe that questions of issue estoppel, and related doctrines, are routinely dealt with as separate questions. He referred to: Whiteley-Bond v Abletts Transport Pty Ltd [2009] ACTSC 81 ; Spencer v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 1256 at [192] ; Commonwealth v Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 322 ; Kuppers v New South Wales Fire Brigades [2005] NSWSC 193 ; CEO of Customs v Au [2005] NSWCA 119 ; Landmark Building Developments Pty Ltd v Toyama Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1103 ; Lewis v Nortex Pty Ltd (in liq) [2002] NSWSC 124 ; Tiufino v Warland [2000] NSWCA 110 ; (2000) 50 NSWLR 104 ; Minero Pty Ltd v Redero Pty Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Santow J, 29 July 1998); Kemeny v Kemeny [1998] FamCA 34 ; Linprint Pty Ltd v Hexham Textiles Pty Ltd (1991) 23 NSWLR 508 ; Dissidomino v Butcher Paull &amp; Calder [2004] WASC 122. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1293">Nevertheless, there remain cases in which separate questions are plainly in the interests of efficient case management. Issue estoppel and its related doctrines are routinely considered by way of separate questions in Australian courts. See Whiteley-Bond v Abletts Transport Pty Ltd [2009] ACTSC 81 ; Spencer v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 1256 at [192] ; Commonwealth v Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 322 ; Kuppers v New South Wales Fire Brigades [2005] NSWSC 193 ; CEO of Customs v Au [2005] NSWCA 119 ; Landmark Building Developments Pty Ltd v Toyama Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1103 ; Lewis v Nortex Pty Ltd (in liq) [2002] NSWSC 124 ; Tiufino v Warland [2000] NSWCA 110 ; (2000) 50 NSWLR 104 ; Minero Pty Ltd v Redero Pty Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Santow J, 29 July 1998); Kemeny v Kemeny [1998] FamCA 34 ; Linprint Pty Ltd v Hexham Textiles Pty Ltd (1991) 23 NSWLR 508 ; Dissidomino v Butcher Paull &amp; Calder [2004] WASC 122. They provide suitable subject matter for separate determination, as the inquiry is confined to the effect of the previous judgment, rather than addressing any evidence as to the underlying facts. Indeed, it would usually subvert much of the benefit of those doctrines to delay their consideration until trial, as the parties would be put to the cost of litigating the previously decided issues in the meantime.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] HCA 28">In coming to his conclusion on the s 31A application, his Honour found: 
 There was a serious question to be tried as to whether the detriment suffered by Mr Spencer resulting from the restrictions imposed by the State Acts constituted an acquisition in respect of his farm. Whether the restrictions imposed by the State Acts were such as to constitute an acquisition might depend upon "detailed evidence of value" [17] . Neither of the Commonwealth Acts, by its direct, legal and practical operation, affected any vested proprietary right or cause of action of Mr Spencer in any way [18] . Neither of the Commonwealth Acts authorised the making of any agreement with a State "requiring the State to acquire property on unjust terms as a condition of receiving a grant of financial assistance from the Commonwealth". The Acts were not laws with respect to the acquisition of property under s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution [19] . The 1997 agreement [20] did not "require or affect or authorise the exercise of any discretion under the State Statutes to refuse development consent for the clearing of native vegetation on any land" [21] .  His Honour concluded that there was no serious question to be tried or, "[p]utting it the other way", that there was no "reasonable prospect" that Mr Spencer would succeed in obtaining the final relief that he claimed in the proceeding [23] . In relation to Mr Spencer's claim for interlocutory relief, his Honour also expressed the obiter opinion that the balance of convenience did not warrant the grant of an injunction [24] .

In relation to Mr Spencer's claim for interlocutory relief, his Honour also expressed the obiter opinion that the balance of convenience did not warrant the grant of an injunction [24] . 
  At first instance, Emmett J held [58] that the applicant had no reasonable prospect of obtaining any of the relief which he claimed against the Commonwealth, and granted the Commonwealth's motion that the proceeding be summarily dismissed pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court Act . The Full Court of the Federal Court (Black CJ, Jacobson and Jagot JJ) dismissed [59] the applicant's appeal against the order for summary dismissal.
  A critical step in the reasoning at first instance [60] , and in the Full Court [61] , was that the applicant could identify no Commonwealth law with respect to an acquisition of property because no law of the Commonwealth required or permitted the imposition of a term or condition of a grant of financial assistance under s 96 of the Constitution binding the State to acquire property otherwise than on just terms. Whether that proposition is right need not be, and is not, examined in these reasons.
  His Honour did not determine a Commonwealth objection to Mr Spencer's standing to challenge the validity of the Financial Assistance Act and the Natural Heritage Trust Act , which reduced to the proposition that Mr Spencer would be subject to the State Acts (which were not under challenge) even if the Commonwealth Acts were held to be invalid [22] .

On 28 August 2008, Emmett J, on the Commonwealth's motion, made an order dismissing the proceedings pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Federal Court Act ") on the basis that Mr Spencer had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceedings. His Honour also dismissed a motion for interlocutory injunctive relief filed by Mr Spencer. He held that there was no serious question to be tried as to whether Mr Spencer was entitled to the final relief which he claimed [3] . Mr Spencer was granted leave by a judge of the Federal Court to appeal from the decision of Emmett J and on 24 March 2009 the Full Court of the Federal Court dismissed his appeal with costs [4] . He applied for special leave to appeal to this Court. In coming to his conclusion on the s 31A application, his Honour found: 
 There was a serious question to be tried as to whether the detriment suffered by Mr Spencer resulting from the restrictions imposed by the State Acts constituted an acquisition in respect of his farm. Whether the restrictions imposed by the State Acts were such as to constitute an acquisition might depend upon "detailed evidence of value" [17] . Neither of the Commonwealth Acts, by its direct, legal and practical operation, affected any vested proprietary right or cause of action of Mr Spencer in any way [18] . Neither of the Commonwealth Acts authorised the making of any agreement with a State "requiring the State to acquire property on unjust terms as a condition of receiving a grant of financial assistance from the Commonwealth". The Acts were not laws with respect to the acquisition of property under s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution [19] . The 1997 agreement [20] did not "require or affect or authorise the exercise of any discretion under the State Statutes to refuse development consent for the clearing of native vegetation on any land" [21] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] NSWCA 75">12 The proceedings in this Court were commenced in 2008. In that year, the applicant was also the applicant in proceedings he commenced in the Federal Court of Australia against the Commonwealth of Australia. In the Federal Court proceedings he complained that the effect of the State Acts was to impose a prohibition or general restriction on the reasonable use of his property with the consequence that certain of his interests in the property had been expropriated or acquired. He also claimed that that expropriation or acquisition was effected or authorised by the operation of the Commonwealth Acts. He claimed that those Commonwealth Acts were laws with respect to the acquisition of property which were invalid insofar as they effected or authorised an acquisition of his property, because they did not provide for just terms: cf the Constitution , s 51(xxxi): Spencer v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 1256 (at [2] - [3]) per Emmett J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] NSWLEC 217">The next issue raised by the Applicant is whether a remediation notice issued under s 38 amounts to the taking of property in breach of s 51(xxxi) of the Commonwealth Constitution . The Applicant relied on Spencer v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 1256 which was the judgment of the Federal Court at first instance. In Spencer, the applicant was challenging two Commonwealth laws because, it was argued, they caused the NSW government to pass the NV Act and its predecessor (the State Acts). He argued the State Acts had the effect of acquiring his property by prohibiting the clearing of native vegetation which he argued effected the acquisition or expropriation of certain interests in his family property. The Commonwealth statutes were laws with respect to the acquisition of property which did not provide for just terms and therefore were in breach of s 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution . At first instance the judge granted the Commonwealth's application for summary dismissal of the proceedings because he considered that there was no reasonable prospect of success. Mr Spencer appealed.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 672">In a case such as the present where the question to be decided is a question of law, the Court must determine whether the argument advanced by Mrs Vranic is "sufficiently strong to warrant the matter going to trial" ( Bradken Resources Pty Ltd v Lynx Engineering Consultants Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1257 per Emmett J at [28]; Spencer v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 1256 per Emmett J; and McAleer v The University of Western Australia (No 3) [2008] FCA 1490 per Siopis J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCAFC 38">5 The primary judge concluded that Mr Spencer had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding (essentially because Mr Spencer could not identify any Commonwealth law with respect to the acquisition of property). Accordingly, the Commonwealth's motion was granted and Mr Spencer's dismissed ( Spencer v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 1256). Mr Spencer sought and obtained leave to appeal against the decision of the primary judge. As Mr Spencer abandoned his claim for interlocutory relief, the issue on appeal is the primary judge's summary dismissal of the proceeding under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act .
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] NSWCA 338">95 Lloyd J held that the reasoning in Pye v Renshaw [1951] HCA 8 ; (1951) 84 CLR 58 was applicable and, accordingly, that the applicants' proceedings revealed no reasonable cause of action. His Honour also held that the High Court's reasons for reaching a different conclusion in P J Magennis Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [1949] HCA 66 ; (1949) 80 CLR 382 did not apply in the present case. In my opinion, his Honour was correct and the decision in Pye v Renshaw does determine the outcome of this case. More recently Emmett J has come to the same conclusion on a comparable legislative scheme in Spencer v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 1256. </sentence>
