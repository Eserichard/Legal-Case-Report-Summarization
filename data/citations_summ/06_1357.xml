<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 235">The prohibition imposed on the court by s 1322(6) does not operate if the court is affirmatively satisfied as to any one of these three s 1322(6)(a) matters, as well as the s 1322(6)(c) matter. That the s 1322(6)(a) barrier is removed by a positive finding on any one of the three matters in (i) to (iii), regardless of any view that might be formed on the other two, was confirmed in Sheahan v Londish (above) at [160] by reference to cases including Re MLC Ltd [2006] FCA 1357 ; (2006) 60 ACSR 187. The matter was put thus by French J in Re Ausam Resources Ltd [2004] FCA 823 at [19] : 
 
"The conditions referred to in s 1322(6) have been treated as disjunctive by Barrett J in a decision which he made which is referred to in the submissions. That was Re Continental Pacific Insurance Co [2002] NSWSC 789 and I am prepared to accept that that construction is a correct construction and that notwithstanding that the act, matter or thing is not necessarily of a procedural nature it may be validated when the person or persons concerned in or party to the contravention or failure have acted honestly or it is just and equitable that the order be made. " 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWCA 270">If it is just an equitable to make an order under s 1322(4)(a) it does not matter that the act or thing may not be procedural, however, the validation of "notices" so that they operate may be procedural. It was just and equitable to make the validating order pursuant to s 1322(6)(a) because there is a clear reality of the relevant shareholders and directors intending to affect a purpose within their mandate and no substantial injustice was likely to be caused to Peter. NRMA v Gould (1995) 18 ACSR 290 ; Jordan v Avram (1997) 25 ACSR 153 ; Re Freehouse Pty Ltd (1997) 26 ACSR 662 ; Re MLC Ltd [2006] FCA 1357 ; (2006) 60 ACSR 187 applied; 
 

 
Young JA, obiter : the solemn making of a resolution by document purporting to produce the same effect as a resolution at a meeting is a "proceeding" for the purposes of s 1322(2) in the sense of "proceedings" in a meeting. 5. As to whether the matter should be remitted on improper purpose: 
 
Hodgson JA, (Young JA and Lindgren AJA agreeing): the matter ought not be remitted on the issue of possible improper purpose because the because the first respondent accepted the primary judge's invitation to decide the matter based on invalidity alone; improper purpose was relevant to s 1322(4) and was rejected by Palmer J and there was no evidence suggesting a change in circumstances before that decision. 160 However, s 1322(6) gives three alternative gateways and, if it is just and equitable to make the order, it does not matter that it may be other than of a procedural nature. Although there was some doubt about this proposition for a while, by the time Re MLC Ltd [2006] FCA 1357 ; (2006) 60 ACSR 187 was decided, it had become the standard construction, see p 189.</sentence>
