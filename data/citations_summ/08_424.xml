<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 553">This proceeding was heard immediately after argument had concluded in Dunn v Australian Crime Commission [2008] FCA 424. It was convenient to follow this course because the applicant sought, and had been granted leave, to rely on the same evidence which had been tendered in the Dunn case in this proceeding and because, apart from two additional matters, the same grounds and argument as had been advanced in Dunn were pursued in this case. </sentence>
