<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 851">Notwithstanding the difference in language as between O 52 r 5(3) and O 52 r 15(2), namely the constraint in r 15(2) that the Court may give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal " at any time " where there are " special reasons ", principles relevant to the exercise of that discretion have been applied when considering r 5(3): SZMFT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1725. Cowdroy J there stated: 
 [21] The Court observes that in considering whether to grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal under O 52 r 15(2) of the Rules, the Court must be satisfied that there is an acceptable explanation for the delay, that there would be no undue prejudice to the respondent if the Court were to grant leave, and that there is merit in the substantial application: see Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348---349. There appears to be no valid reason why such considerations should not also apply to an application seeking an order of the Court that dispenses with the 21 day time limit prescribed by O 52 r 5(2) of the Rules. 

 
Compliance with O 52 r 5(2) was there dispensed with in circumstances where the application for leave to appeal was filed out of time by ten days. See also: Nguyen v Pascoe [2006] FCA 719 at [41] . </sentence>
