<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 881">37 In my view, Clough has a prima facie case for the relief variously claimed in that, for reasons I set out below, ONGC would arguably be in breach of the contract and acting contrary to the express terms of the performance guarantees and acting unconscionably, in contravention of s 51AA of the Act, if it were to take further steps in making demands or obtaining payment under the performance guarantees: Merpro Montassa Ltd v Conoco Specialty Products Inc [1991] FCA 70 ; (1991) 28 FCR 387 , 390; Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd (in liq) (1991) 30 FCR 102 , 110; Sydbank Soenderjylland A/S v Bannerton Holdings Pty (1996) 68 FCR 539 , 549; Eurogold Ltd v Oxus Holdings (Malta) Ltd [2006] FCA 1270. It is not necessary for an applicant seeking leave to show a prima facie cause of action in respect of each of the causes of action pleaded: Bray v F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd [2003] FCAFC 153 ; (2003) 130 FCR 317 ; Traxon Industries Pty Ltd v Emerson Electric Co [2006] FCA 450 ; (2006) 230 ALR 297 , 311 [65]. Nevertheless, Clough does so here.  26 It is contended by Clough that this Court has jurisdiction in the proceedings. In my view this is so because: 
 
 
 (a) Clough claims that ONGC has contravened and may again contravene s 51AA of the Act; 
 (b) by s 86(1) of the Act jurisdiction is conferred on this Court in any matter arising under the Act in respect of which a civil proceeding has been instituted under Part VI; and 
 (c) by s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), the original jurisdiction of this Court also includes jurisdiction in any matter arising under any laws made by the Commonwealth Parliament (other than criminal matters), 
 

See generally: Traxon Industries Pty Ltd v Emerson Electric Co [2006] FCA 450 ; (2006) 230 ALR 297 , 308 [50]-[51] ([2006] FCA 450). See also, Burgundy Royale Investments v Westpac Banking Corporation (1987) 18 FCR 212 , 219; Eurogold Ltd v Oxus Holdings (Malta) Ltd [2007] FCA 811 [15]-[19].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 825">Order 8 in its present form commenced on the 1 August 2006. The form of the repealed Order 8 differs materially from the current Order 8, in that the former Order 8 rule 1, due to the inclusion of sub-rule 1(n), had been construed in a way that required each cause of action pleaded in the statement of claim to be within one or more of the categories listed in Order 8 rule 1. In that regard, the applicant referred the Court to the dicta of French J in Traxon Industries Pty Ltd v Emerson Electric Co [2006] FCA 450 ; (2006) 230 ALR 297 at [63] - [64] , where his Honour observed as follows:
 
 The question that then arises is whether, given that the causes of action in misleading or deceptive conduct and breach of contract are within O 8 r 1, that is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that the rule "applies to the proceeding" within the meaning of O 8 r 2(2)(b). As to that von Doussa J in Delco Australia said (at [35]): 
 
 
 
 In this Court r 1 (n) makes express provision for a proceeding where a proceeding does not fall squarely within one of the heads enumerated in the earlier paragraphs. In my opinion r 1(n) makes it clear that an originating process to be served out of the Commonwealth must be confined to causes of action that fall wholly within one or several of the heads in r 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 630">1 Traxon Industries Pty Ltd (Traxon) applied to the Court by motion dated 18 April 2006 for leave to serve proceedings on Emerson Electric Co (Emerson) in the United States of America (USA). The proceedings arose out of a dispute between Traxon and Emerson connected with the performance of a Confidentiality Agreement and a Distributorship Agreement relating to the marketing and sale, in the USA, of oil level control devices manufactured by Traxon. Traxon's causes of action against Emerson were for misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), breach of contract, breach of duty of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty. For reasons published on 26 April 2006 the motion was adjourned and Traxon given leave to amend its statement of claim and to file further affidavit evidence in support of its application --- Traxon Industries Pty Ltd v Emerson Electric Co [2006] FCA 450. The principal reason for the decision not to accede to Traxon's motion was its inclusion in the application and statement of claim of the causes of action arising out of breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty. These causes of action were based entirely on conduct allegedly committed by Emerson in the United States. They did not otherwise fall within any of the categories of causes of action to which the relevant rule of Court, O 8, authorising service out of the jurisdiction, applies. </sentence>
