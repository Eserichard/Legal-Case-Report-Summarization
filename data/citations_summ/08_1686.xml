<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 125">I reject this as a matter of fact. I accept, of course, that Ms Shand lacks the computer skills to carry out the task at hand; I accept also, as Mr Harper SC submitted on her behalf, that she does not even know what kind of computer expert would be necessary in order to access the Seagate drive. However, I do not accept that that means she is not able to obtain access. It would be easy enough for her to ask technicians from the judicial manager's office to show her how the data might be retrieved or, if they will not, what kind of expert she might speak with to the same end. There are any number of firms in this city offering technology services of this kind. Imaging of hard drives is a widespread phenomenon in modern insolvency and litigation practice. Such images are frequently before the Court as are the experts involved in their production: cf. Kennedy v Baker (No 2) [2004] FCA 809 ; Different Solutions Pty Ltd v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2008] FCA 1686. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1170">Each of the limitations upon the power conferred by these provisions only assumes additional importance when it is recalled that a search warrant may be issued and executed in respect to premises occupied by persons other than those involved or suspected of being involved in criminal activity. Where the terms of s 3E are satisfied, a warrant may thus be issued in respect to premises occupied by persons unconnected with any crime. The fundamental interference with privacy which is authorised by a search warrant must be constantly borne in mind. Search warrants are " ... intrusions into the sanctity of a person's domain and concomitantly an interference with his privacy ... ": Different Solutions Pty Ltd v Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2008] FCA 1686 at [106] per Graham J (applying: Cloran (1984) 4 FCR at 154 per Lockhart J). Similarly, in TVW Ltd v Robinson [1964] WAR 33 at 37 Negus J observed: 
 
 The issue of a search warrant is a very serious matter indeed because it authorizes the invasion of the privacy of the subject in his home or in his business premises. It necessarily involves an interference with the rights of an individual and affects his liberty. 
 

 
See also: Mitchell v New Plymouth Club (Incorporated ) [1958] NZLR 1070 at 1072. Although effect must be given to the terms employed in s 3E , it is also legitimate to bear in mind that the common law has long been " jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions ": George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 110 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWSC 314">50 In light of the legislature's concern to protect individual interests, strict compliance with statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is necessary: George v Rockett (supra) at 110-111. However, that said, a warrant should, like other documents, be read fairly and not perversely: Different Solutions Pty Limited v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2008] FCA 1686 at [108] .</sentence>
