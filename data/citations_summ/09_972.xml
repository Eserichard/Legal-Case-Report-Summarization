<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 253">The Rules require a Statement of Claim to state the material facts. However as many authorities demonstrate, the adequacy of pleadings are often dealt with in a more flexible way than would be required by a strict application of the Rules. That reflects the discretionary nature of the Court's power to control pleadings and the requirement that the Rules be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overarching purposes identified in s 37M of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In that respect, the Court ought take into account defects of substance not form: State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 499 at [19] . It ought not expect a pleading to be formulated as an elegant model of legal purity: ACCC v Pauls at [10]. The Court ought not take a pedantic approach to a pleading: ACCC v Craftmatic Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 972 at [14] . It ought not take a strict view as to the dichotomy between material facts and particulars. The Court will read the pleading as a whole and will be fundamentally guided by the basic principle that a pleading must be sufficient to put the other party on notice of the case that it is required to meet: ACCC v Craftmatic at [14]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 762">In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Craftmatic Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 972 , Logan J warned against a pedantic approach (at [14]): 
 
 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pauls Ltd [1999] FCA 1750 at [10] , with reference to sentiments to that effect then recently expressed by Wilcox J in Coshott v Kam Tou Mak [1998] FCA 147 , O'Loughlin J observed that there was a contemporary tendency against the taking of a pedantic approach to a pleading. A decade later that remains the case. Further, a pleading must be read as a whole. The countervailing consideration is whether, accepting it must be so read, the pleading fairly puts the other party on notice as to the case to be met. A pleading is but a means to the achievement of procedural fairness and of the efficient use of judicial resources and those of the parties by the identification of what is truly at issue.
