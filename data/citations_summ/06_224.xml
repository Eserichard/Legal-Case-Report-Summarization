<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 973">9 The applicant then sought leave to appeal and that came before me. After the applicant initially failed to appear, I granted him leave to set aside my earlier decision, dismissing the application, heard it and determined that, similarly to my earlier decision, the application was without substance: SZGGS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 224 and [2006] FCA 378. Heydon J dismissed an application in the High Court for leave to appeal out of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 569">The Applicant then sought leave to appeal against this decision. On 1 March 2006 Rares J dismissed the application (noting that the applicant had failed to appear) saying: I am of the opinion that there is no substance whatever in the proposed grounds of appeal. [2] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 993">6 The applicant sought to appeal from that decision but when the matter came before Branson J on 21 July 2005, he did not appear and her Honour dismissed the proceedings pursuant to 25(2)B(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). When the proceedings from which the current application were brought before Smith FM, he carefully considered the litigious history. He noted that the new proceedings before him purported to challenge the delegate's decision (see [2006] FMCA 63 [13]-[15]. That is, a wholly impermissible approach: SZGGS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 224 and the decision of Heydon J on appeal, SZGGS v MIMIA [2006] HCA Trans 352. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 990">It is not open, in proceedings of this kind, where an applicant has already applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal for his or her matter to be the subject of a review, to contend that the delegate's decision has any further validity in law following the decision of the Tribunal: see SZGGS v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 224 and Heydon J's decision dismissing the summons seeking to appeal from that decision ( SZGGS v MIMIA [2006] HCA Trans 352).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 992">9 The submissions that were filed by the applicant on 5 July 2006 also seek to challenge the delegate's decision which had been the subject of his application to the Tribunal for review. That was plainly incompetent: see SZGGS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 224 and the decision of Heydon J refusing leave to appeal in that matter, SZGGS v MIMA [2006] HCA Trans 352 ; see also SZDPF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 85 , and Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 242 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 1007">17 The application before his Honour was found to be an abuse of process (see [14]). It is clear that the attack on the delegate's decision has been made, as is frequently done in recent times, because the applicants, having failed to set aside in judicial review proceedings a decision of the Tribunal then seek to attack the decision of the delegate, the subject of the review. For the reasons that I explained in SZGGS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 224 and upheld by Heydon J in SZGGS v MIMIA &amp; Anor [2006] HCA Trans 352 , it is not open to challenge a delegate's decision after there has been a full hearing on review of that decision by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] HCATrans 352">He made orders dismissing the application as lacking any substance: see SZGGS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 224.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] FMCA 946">I refer to the decisions of Rares J in the Federal Court in SZGGS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 224 and also by his Honour in SZDCR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 350.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] FCA 378">I pointed out to the applicant that his present proceedings involved an application for leave to appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court's dismissal of his attempt to review the decision of the delegate of the first respondent for the reasons that I set out in [12], [13] and [14] of my judgment SZGGS v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 224.</sentence>
