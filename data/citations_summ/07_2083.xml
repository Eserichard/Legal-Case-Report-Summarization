[93] Baker FCR at 365-366 per Gyles J; FCA at para.30 per Gyles J.

The cases cited by Mr Gera in support of the proposition that it was a denial of procedural fairness are not binding on this Court. The decisions cited by the Court above, being decisions of the Federal Court, are binding.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1583">Mr Neil endeavoured to persuade the Court that there was case law which provided that these civil proceedings must be stayed until a decision is made by relevant authorities as to whether to proceed with criminal proceedings, presumably, at least, against Mr Nugent. The Court refused to adjourn or stay the proceedings on the basis sought by Mr Neil. The Court indicated that it was not its present understanding that the possibility of future criminal proceedings must necessarily result in the adjournment or staying of proceedings. [10] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FamCA 296">His Honour said at 172: 
Consistently with that statement the Court will ordinarily allow proceedings in which its jurisdiction has been properly invoked to progress to trial and determination unless the legitimate interests of the parties and the administration of justice require otherwise. The judgment to be made is essential normative and requires a balancing of factors of the kind referred to in the judgment of Wootten J. See also Halabi v Westpac Banking Corporation [1989] 17 NSWLR 26 at 59; Yuill v Spedley Securities Ltd (in liq) (1992) 8 ACSR 272 at 274 per Kirby P; Baker v Commissioner of Federal Police [2000] FCA 1339 ; (2000) 104 FCR 359 at 366 per McHugh J; New South Wales Crime Commission v Kelly , [2003] NSWCA 245 per Sheller JA, Santow JA, Tobias JA; Niven v SS [2006] NSWCA 338 per Beazley JA, Giles JA, Tobias JA and Goreng Goreng v Jennaway [2007] FCA 2083 per Flick J. On behalf of the Wife it is submitted that even in Western Australia v Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd (supra) where French J held at 173 that there was a "significant overlap of issues" between the civil and criminal proceedings, his Honour was still not persuaded of the need either to stay the civil proceedings (because, as here there was no reasonable prospect that they would be heard at the same time as the criminal proceedings), and nor was he persuaded that the interlocutory progress of the civil proceedings should cease. On the contrary, he held it should continue, subject to substituting for the time being general discovery with potential limited discovery orders and to dealing with any particular issues that may arise with regard to particular interlocutory steps on a case by case basis, and not by excusing compliance in limine.</sentence>
