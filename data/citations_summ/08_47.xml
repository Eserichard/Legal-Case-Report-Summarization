<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 536">It therefore comes as no surprise to discover that the decisions of this Court, necessarily by judges at first instance, have suggested that clear cut cases for the grant, or refusal of leave to appeal will obviously be more readily, and speedily, dealt with by a single judge than by requiring the attention of a Full Court: Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 at [8] ( Optiver ), Buchanan J; but that where the case for the grant or refusal of leave is more evenly balanced, considerations of a different kind are raised: Optiver at [9]; and that it may not be necessary to express any firm view about the strength of contentions advanced by an applicant where a case is evenly balanced: Optiver at [18]; or that a direction that the application be determined by a Full Court should not be made in a case which can be characterised as a minor interlocutory squabble over discovery or the like: TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1329 ( TS Production ) at [7] per Heerey J; but that that there may be cases where the presence or absence of either substantial injustice or sufficient doubt is so clear and obvious that the application should be disposed of on that ground alone: TS Production at [11]; or that the case is one, identifiable through experience, where it is not really practicable to separate out the leave issue of whether the decision below is attended with sufficient doubt from the substantive merits: TS Production at [13]; or that the application to appeal is "hopeless": Allphones Retail Pty Ltd ACN 008 168 090 v Weimann [ 2009] FCA 849 ( Allphones ) at [13], McKerracher J; and where the decision has serious implications for the parties or one of them if the decision to be appealed against is allowed to stand: Allphones at [22]; or where the application for leave to appeal is not straight forward, suggesting that on efficiency and cost consideration grounds the direction to the Full Court should be made: Edwards v Santos Limited [2010] FCA 34 at [10] , per Collier J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 592">In Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1516 , Moore J held: 
 
 ... [A]ll s 25(2) does is confer appellate jurisdiction on single judges and Full Courts to deal with applications for leave to appeal. Order 52, r 2AA prescribes, in my opinion unexceptionably, the mechanism that determines whether this jurisdiction will be exercised by a single judge, on the one hand, or a Full Court, on the other. As Buchanan J correctly observed in McDonald's Australia Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2008] FCA 395 ; (2008 69 ATR 898 , referring to his Honour's earlier judgment in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 , the provisions of O 52, r 2AA admit no debate about the existence of any such right of election. There is none. 
 

  That rule provides: 
 
 An application mentioned in subsection 25(2) of the Act must be heard and determined by a single Judge unless: 
 

(a) a Judge directs that the application be heard and determined by a Full Court; or
 
(b) the application is made in a proceeding that has already been assigned to a Full Court, and the Full Court considers it is appropriate for it to hear and determine the application. As Buchanan J observed in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47: 
 
 
 Any question about that aspect of the Court's practice (and power) was, in 2005, put beyond further debate by O 52, r 2AA of the Federal Court Rules which directs that an application under s 25(2) of the Act must be heard and determined by a single judge unless a judge directs that the applicant be heard and determined by a Full Court.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 34">A number of these factors emerge from cases including Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 , TS Production LLC [2008] FCA 1329 , Zegarac v Pitcher Partners [2009] FCA 1061 , Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 849 and Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1516 ; (2008) 172 FCR 469. Consideration
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 849">Section 25(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (FCA) provides for an application for leave to appeal to be heard and determined by a single judge or a Full Court. Order 52 r 2AA of the Federal Court Rules (FCR) requires the application to be brought before a single judge in the first instance who is to hear and determine the matter unless a direction is made by a judge for the application to be heard and determined by a Full Court. A grant or refusal of leave is generally disposed of by a single judge ( Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 (at [8])).  The factors on which I have touched are all driven simply to answering the question of whether the application for leave should be heard by a Full Court. I have not sought to answer in detail the question as to whether the judgment is attended by doubt sufficient or otherwise for the reason that it is not really practicable to separate out the sufficient doubt issue from the substantive merits. As in TS Production LLC [2008] FCA 1329 and as in Optiver [2008] FCA 47 , the more efficient and appropriate course, is to refer the application for leave to appeal to be heard by a Full Court of this Court. It is not for me to order that the appeal be heard by the Full Court but as in TS Production LLC , I will make an order that subject to any contrary direction of the Full Court, that course be pursued. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1516">

4 Mr Harding has asserted a right to elect and sought to exercise that right by having his application for leave heard by a Full Court. A submission was made by counsel for Mr Harding that the issue of whether an application for leave to appeal is to be heard by a Full Court of a single judge is addressed by s 25(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (FC Act) and O 52 r 2AA could not modify the operation of the FC Act. However, all s 25(2) does is confer appellate jurisdiction on single judges and Full Courts to deal with applications for leave to appeal. Order 52 r 2AA prescribes, in my opinion unexceptionably, the mechanism that determines whether this jurisdiction will be exercised by a single judge, on the one hand, or a Full Court, on the other. As Buchanan J correctly observed in McDonald's Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (No. 2) [2008] FCA 395 , referring to his Honour's earlier judgment in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 , the provisions of O 52 r 2AA admit no debate about the existence of any such right of election. There is none.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 395">15 McDonald's purported to elect to have its applications dealt with by a Full Court of this Court. For reasons which I explained in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 no such right of election now exists, if indeed it existed in the past. The provisions of O 52 r 2AA admit no debate about the existence of any such right of 'election'. An application, such as the present, brought under s 25(2) of the Act must be heard and determined by a single Judge unless a judge directs that the application be heard and determined by a Full Court. </sentence>
