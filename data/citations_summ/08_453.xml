<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 153">In such cases it might not be possible for a judge to suggest the reason for not dealing with additional issues without causing the very harm sought to be avoided. In some cases the consideration of matters which a judge does not strictly need to consider necessary may also give rise to other avoidable difficulties. [79] In some cases one of the further issues considered by a court may not permit a party to appeal the judge's conclusion on that issue [80] but nonetheless bind the party to act upon the view expressed. [81] 
 
 100 In this case the remaining issues arose from concerns I expressed in the context of a proceeding in which the defendants were not legally represented. The concern was to ensure that all potentially relevant matters had been adequately considered in a case in which the defendants were not legally represented in case it became necessary to deal with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCAFC 49">The Commissioner says that the fact that an outgoing is called or labelled 'interest' does not determine its character as an outgoing on revenue account; that it is necessary to determine the 'essential character' of the liability; that in doing so, the nature of the advantage sought is the chief, if not the critical factor in determining the essential character: Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Limited [2006] HCA 35 ; (2006) 228 CLR 1 at [148] per Crennan J (with whom Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreed); GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 137; that the nature of the advantage is to be determined objectively: St George Bank v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 453 ; (2008) 69 ATR 634 ; and essential character is to be considered from a practical and business point of view: Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 648. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] VSC 49">To quote Marshall CJ in Marbury v Madison 5 US [1803] USSC 16 ; (1 Cranch) 137 (1803) at 177: 
 
 
 
 
 
 It is, emphatically, the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. 
 
 
 
 
 
 This passage has been recognised as central to the administration of justice and to the relationship between the judiciary and executive in this country: Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35-36; Corporation of the City of Enfield v Development Assessment Commission [2000] HCA 5 ; (2000) 199 CLR 135 at [42] - [44] and Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (2000) 200 CLR 591 at [116]. [6] 
 
 
 These observations were not made to add a new legal ground to challenge assessments not previously found in the law, nor to encourage collateral proceedings, nor to broaden the scope of judicial review beyond the constitutionally permitted bounds set down in R v Hickman; ex parte Fox [7] and recently affirmed in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Futuris Corporation Limited. [8] The additional observations in Indooroopilly were not the basis upon which the taxpayer succeeded on the point in dispute and were not the articulation of a rule that the Court could not or would not depart from a decision if persuaded that an earlier decision was in error. In Indooroopilly the Court accepted as correct the earlier decisions which the Federal Commissioner of Taxation had sought to overturn rather than find for the taxpayer on some such ground as the need to make the Federal Commissioner accountable as contended for in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCAFC 62">41 A person dissatisfied with an objection decision may apply for a review of that decision by this Court in its original jurisdiction pursuant to s 14ZZ(a)(ii) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth). St George applied for such a review in respect of all five of the objection decisions. Those applications were heard together by a judge of this Court who, on 11 April 2008, dismissed the applications with costs: St George Bank Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 453. From those dismissals St George now appeals.
