<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1862">2 The applicant first sought review of the Tribunal decision on 17 January 2005. In SZFMW v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 768 , Smith FM dismissed the application on the basis that the Tribunal decision contained no jurisdictional error. In that application for review, there was no ground alleging a breach of s 441G of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'). On 22 August 2006, Cowdroy J dismissed an appeal from that decision ( SZFMW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1110). The applicant sought special leave to appeal from the High Court ( SZFMW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2008] HCATrans 138). On 7 March 2008, Heydon and Kiefel JJ dismissed the application saying that there were insufficient prospects of success to justify the grant of special leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1274">On appeal in the Federal Court, Cowdroy J found that the Tribunal's ultimate finding was free from jurisdictional error [5] . [2] On 20 September 2006, the applicant lodged an Application for Special Leave to appeal the decision of Cowdroy J in the High Court of Australia; proceedings No.</sentence>
