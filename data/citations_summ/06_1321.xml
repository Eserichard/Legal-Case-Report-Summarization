<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 604">As there is no reason to conclude that an order of this Court will be enforceable in the United Kingdom because of reciprocal recognition there, the measure of the security to which the respondents are, in my view, entitled, is not any additional expense of enforcement as considered in Barton and Soh, but the costs of the proceedings from this point up to judgment. While I accept that Mr White and Ms Aliperti could have gone into somewhat greater detail in their assessment of the costs their clients are likely to incur, I consider their calculations to be sufficiently specific to accept them as adequate approximations of the respondents' likely solicitor and client costs if this matter runs to hearing. This is not a case where security should be refused because the applicant for security has failed to identify the basis of the amount of security sought: cf Wu v Avin Operations (No.3) [2006] FCA 1321 at [35] and [36]. Mr White estimated that the hearing would run for three days, Ms Aliperti estimated that it would run from three to four days and Mr James estimated that it would run for five days. In the absence of any real information on which to calculate the length of hearing, I take the average figure and estimate that the matter will run for four days. Mr White's figures imply an estimate of four days' preparation and Ms Aliperti expressly stated that a four day hearing would include four days' preparation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 843">In the course of the hearing of the application in a case Mr Reynolds said that he wished to raise a matter of procedural fairness and natural justice. [80] Mr Reynolds said that at the first directions hearing when orders were made for the filing of affidavits in support of the application in a case it was understood that those affidavits would be able to be expanded on by way of oral evidence. [81] When it was put to Mr Reynolds that: that was not the Court's understanding; that was an unusual occurrence in an application in a case; [82] and he had said at the outset of the hearing of the application in a case that no further evidence apart from the affidavit evidence of Mr King and himself was to be led, [83] 
the matter was not pursued. [84] 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 829">That, of course, leads to the next issue, which underlies the real issue in this application, and that is the question of the reliability and credibility of each of the employee, Mr Manning, and the receptionist, Ms Lambourne. If I were to resolve that matter immediately, then I would perhaps be in a position to determine the application in a case on its merits rather than simply on the papers. That would require the granting of leave to cross examine on affidavits in an interlocutory application. It is well settled that such leave is granted sparingly; Freehill Hollingdale &amp; Page v Bandwill Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [2000] WASCA 150 at [29] ; Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd (No.3) [2006] FCA 1321. However, in this case there are good policy reasons why it would not be appropriate, I think, for me to determine that particular point at this time. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] VSC 444">[6] Mr Williams further submitted that the plaintiffs were seeking to gain an unfair advantage in the imminent trial of this proceeding by having a practice run at cross-examining the defendant.</sentence>
