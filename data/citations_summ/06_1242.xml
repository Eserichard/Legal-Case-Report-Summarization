<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCAFC 85">2 The application for funding from the receivers of Lanepoint and Bowesco also went to a provision for the costs to be incurred in prosecuting an application for leave to appeal from another order of French J which had been made on 14 September 2006. That order was related to Bowesco's entitlement to an option to purchase certain property which had been the subject of an assignment by Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd to Bowesco. His Honour's reasons for those orders are to be found in Australian Securities and Investment Commission, In the matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 9) [2006] FCA 1242. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 35">

20 On 15 September 2006, I made orders, in these proceedings, that Bowesco held an option over the Warnbro Shopping Centre assigned to it by Westpoint Corporation subject to a fixed charge in favour of Perpetual Nominees Ltd as trustee of the ING Mortgage Pool. The option had been assigned for a consideration of $100. An offer of $1 million to acquire the option was made by a third party: Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 9) [2006] FCA 1242 ; 58 ACSR 721. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1493">3 Pursuant to that liberty, Bowesco and Lanepoint, by their common director, Karen Carey-Hazell, have each applied to the Court for orders directing the receiver to make provisions to enable them to meet various legal expenses including the costs of resisting the winding up applications in proceedings WAD 177 of 2006 ( ASIC v Bowesco ) and WAD 152 of 2006 ( ASIC v Lanepoint ). They also apply for funding for legal services in relation to the prosecution of an application by Bowesco for leave to appeal against my decision, made on 14 September 2006, relating to Bowesco's entitlement to an option to purchase certain property, which option had been assigned to it by Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 9) [2006] FCA 1242. Pursuant to an order made by Siopis J on 17 October 2006 a motion for leave to appeal out of time and for leave to appeal that decision was referred to the Full Court in the November sittings. The applications also seek orders for the provision of funding for legal services in relation to certain other matters. </sentence>
