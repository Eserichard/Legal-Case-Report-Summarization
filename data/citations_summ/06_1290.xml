<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1179">17 Mr Priestley submits that I am disqualified from hearing this matter by reason of my specific interest in O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules . Mr Priestley submits that I have made comments in a judgment regarding s 31A of the Act and that I have therefore considered and applied s 31A. He submits that this is a further ground for a reasonable apprehension of bias. He says that in Rossetto v Meriton Apartments Proprietary Limited [2006] FCA 1290 I made comments to the effect that s 31A is a valid law of the Commonwealth and that this shows that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias on my part.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1352">However, it seems to me that it is fanciful to suggest that there is any claim which new Boston can bring based on representations GE Capital allegedly made to old Boston. Old Boston never sought to pursue whatever rights it might have had to bring those claims and has now ceased to exist. It is not pleaded that any contract or pre-contractual representation alleged to give rise to a contractual term was ever made to new Boston, on the contrary, it is pleaded that all relevant dealings going to the formation of the GE Capital contract were between GE Capital and old Boston. In Rossetto v Meriton Apartments Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1290 at [15] - [16], Bennett J held that a company incorporated after representations were made to its director who at the time of the incorporation had been informed that the representations were untrue and had been offered rescission of the contract, had no arguable cause of action for the purposes of O 11 r 16. There is, of course, a distinction here. While new Boston must have been aware at the time of the sale agreement that the representation was untrue (if it became a contractual term) because it had been breached by GE Capital in relation to the number of field service calls, no offer had been made for rescission. </sentence>
