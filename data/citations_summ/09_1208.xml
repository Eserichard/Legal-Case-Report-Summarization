<citphrase id="cp6.13" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 85">administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 (cth), ss. 27 , 28 , 33 , 43 (2), 44 . the minister ordered the deportation of the defendant under s. 12 of the migration act 1958 . upon the defendant's application for review of that decision the administrative appeals tribunal ("the tribunal") recommended its revocation. the minister appealed from that decision on the ground inter alia that the tribunal wrongly regarded itself as being restricted in reaching its decision by misconceived principles of law. the minister relied upon three passages in the tribunal's reasons to establish this ground. the first of those passages read: "when an alien who is an established resident becomes liable to deportation under s. 12 , the general rule must be that the conduct which is relied on to show that a deportation order is in the best interests of australia must be proved, not merely suspected."  held: per curiam</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp6.14" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 85">(1) as to the passages in the decision of the tribunal, other than that set out above, relied upon by the minister, the tribunal had not purported to lay down any binding principle of law but merely what it saw as general principles of fairness and common sense which were considered appropriate to the case before the tribunal and which the president stated in general terms for the guidance of members of the tribunal in the future performance of their functions.  per deane j., with whose reasons for judgment evatt j. agreed</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp6.15" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 85">(2) a similar position existed in relation to the first passage quoted above.  (3) in any event as a matter of law the tribunal was required in the circumstances to observe that principle because: (a) the tribunal is under a duty to observe the requirements of natural justice. sullivan v. department of transport (1978), 20 alr 323 ; drake v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs [1979] aata 179 ; (1979), 24 alr 577 , applied. (b) it is an ordinary requirement of natural justice that a person bound to act judicially "base his decision" upon material which tends logically to show the existence or non-existence of facts relevant to the issue to be determined. r. v. deputy industrial injuries commissioner; ex parte moore, (1965) 1 qb 4568 applied.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 936">Mr Wilson's contention is supported by a judgment of a Full Court of the Federal Court, namely Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2009] FCA 1208 ; (2010) 74 ACSR 604. The Full Court decided that if a show cause notice is given within the period of seven years after the lodging of the first triggering liquidator's report, any lapse of time is only a consideration relevant to the exercise of the discretion to disqualify, and an implied obligation to exercise the power under s 206F(1) with reasonable promptness is not a condition precedent to the exercise of the power. Mr Sallis very properly accepted this position after the Full Court judgment became available (which was after he had first raised his contention on this aspect in the present proceedings). However, he maintained that there had been unreasonable delay on ASIC's part, and that this was relevant for a consideration of "other matters" being the final criterion in s 206F(2)(b)(iii). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 43">3 On 30 October 2009 the learned primary Judge published reasons dealing with each of the six identified questions of law: see Culley v ASIC [2009] FCA 1208 ("the earlier reasons"). For present purposes, it is necessary only to have regard to the questions numbered 5 and 6 which his Honour examined. Those questions were in these terms; 
 
 
 (5) Whether the statutory power of disqualification contained in s 206F of the Corporations Act is subject to an implied requirement that it be exercised within a reasonable time; and
 (6) Whether the respondent failed to exercise its statutory power of disqualification contained in s 206F of the Corporations Act within a reasonable time. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1474">In Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2009] FCA 1208 , Mr Brian Culley brought an appeal to this Court under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act"). The Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the respondent ("ASIC") which prohibited Mr Culley from managing a corporation for a period of two years. The delegate's decision was made under s 206F of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act"). </sentence>
