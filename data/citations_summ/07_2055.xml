<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] HCATrans 69">Leave to appeal to the Federal Court was refused by Justice Kenny of that court; see Scott v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 2055 , on the footing that there was no reason to doubt the correctness of the decision made by the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1323">In the letter Ms Toohey outlined the background to the complaint. She said that Mr and Mrs Scott had made a previous complaint to the Commission on 28 August 2006. The Commission determined not to inquire into that complaint. Mr and Mrs Scott sought judicial review of that decision and the application was summarily dismissed by the Federal Magistrates Court ( Scott v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FMCA 1642). Ms Toohey recorded that an application for leave to appeal was refused on 21 December 2007 by Kenny J: Scott v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 2055 ( Scott v HREOC ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 674">This is an appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate refusing review of two decisions purportedly made by the Migration Agents Registration Authority ("MARA"). The Federal Magistrate disposed of the proceedings summarily on the ground that neither of the two challenged decisions was a "decision" for the purposes of ss 3 and 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1997 (Cth) (the "AD(JR) Act"). Because the matter was decided on a summary basis, the decision was interlocutory: see Scott v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 2055. Section 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) provides that an "appeal shall not be brought from... an interlocutory judgment unless the Court or a Judge gives leave to appeal". As a consequence, an appeal would, generally, lie only by leave: see O 52, rr 2A-9 of the Federal Court Rules . However MARA has indicated that it is willing to proceed upon the basis that the notice of appeal constitutes an application for leave to appeal. I proceed accordingly. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 410">However, it is clear that leave to appeal is required, as the decision was an interlocutory one. It is also clear that the application for leave to appeal can be heard by a single judge. It is interlocutory in nature, since it rests on his Honour's finding that the application is frivolous or vexatious and fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action. As was said in Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1572 ; (2000) 104 FCR 564 at [43] per French J (with whom Beaumont and Finkelstein JJ agreed) "[i]f a proceeding is dismissed because it is frivolous or vexatious or because no reasonable cause of action is disclosed the decision is treated as interlocutory": see also Scott v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 2055 at [16] per Kenny J; Finikiotis v Sims Partners [2005] FCA 1774 at [10] per Lander J and Rana v University of South Australia [2004] FCA 559 ; (2004) 136 FCR 344 at 346 per Lander J. Interlocutory decisions require leave to appeal pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (FCA Act). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 415">In the course of this litigation, which has now gone on for over a decade, members of this Court have commented on its futility. In Scott v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 2055 at [23] Kenny J, for example, was moved to observe that "[t]he time has come for Mr and Mrs Scott to turn away from their dispute with Centrelink over the Special Benefit payment. " Earlier, the Full Court in Scott v Pedler [2004] FCAFC 67 characterised the attempt, by Mr and Mrs Scott, in Scott v Pedler [2003] FCA 650 , as, in substance, constituting an abuse of process of the Court. It was effectively doomed to failure by the decision of Heerey J in Scott v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1999] FCA 1774. Undeterred by these observations Mr and Mrs Scott lodged their complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which led to the proceedings which were dealt with by Phipps FM and Kenny J. Their complaint relied on substantially the same material on which the two previous proceedings in this Court were founded.  Mr and Mrs Scott harbour a deep sense of grievance arising from the failure of the relevant Commonwealth agency to pay special benefit to Mrs Scott in the three month period in 1995. They assert that this failure jeopardised their ability to obtain food and shelter and constituted a fundamental attack on their human rights. They have alleged that the failure was the result of a deliberate decision which was intended to cause them harm. At various stages they have alleged that the relevant officers had acted in contravention of applicable legislation and were liable in deceit and for misfeasance in public office. These allegations have been tested and rejected in a series of decisions: Scott v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1999] FCA 1774 (Heerey J); Scott v Secretary, Department of Social Security [2000] FCA 1241 (Beaumont , French and Finkelstein JJ) (Appeal from Heerey J dismissed); Scott v Secretary, Department of Social Security M112/00 (Kirby and Callinan JJ) (Special leave to appeal from Full Court refused); Scott v Pedler [2003] FCA 650 (Gray ACJ); Scott &amp; Anor v Pedler &amp; Ors [2004] FCAFC 67 (Gyles , Conti and Allsop JJ) (Appeal from Gray ACJ dismissed); Scott v Pedler M83 of 2004 (Hayne and Crennan JJ) (Special leave to appeal from Full Court dismissed); Scott v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FMCA 1642 (Phipps FM); and Scott v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 2055 (Kenny J) (Application for leave to appeal refused).  It was not open to the Federal Magistrate to treat the decisions of the High Court and this Court as having been wrongly decided. He made his decision after he had rejected the attempt by Mr and Mrs Scott to re-agitate their grievances under human rights legislation. Mr and Mrs Scott were refused leave to appeal from the Federal Magistrate's decision by Kenny J. In refusing leave her Honour observed, at [2007] FCA 2055 at [19] , that: 
 "The central difficulty for the applicants is that, for the most part, the underlying conduct about which they complain has already been the subject of comprehensive judicial consideration. Although the applicants now formulate their claims before HREOC as violations of their human rights, there is no doubt that they continue to attack (though by another route) the conduct of Centrelink in refusing to grant Mrs Scott a Special Benefit. " 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 65">On 18 October 2007 I summarily dismissed the Scotts' judicial review application ( Scott v HREOC [2007] FMCA 1642 ). They applied to the Federal Court of Australia for leave to appeal from my decision. Leave to appeal were refused by Kenny J on 21 December 2007 ( Scott v HREOC [2007] FCA 2055 ) Her Honour said at [23]: 23 As we have seen, the courts have already given extensive consideration to their claims and have given judgment. The time has come for Mr and Mrs Scott to turn away from their dispute with Centrelink over the Special Benefits payment. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 1340">Senior Member Allan (third respondent), Senior Member Kelly (fourth respondent), Senior Member Isenberg (fifth respondent), Deputy President Purvis (sixth respondent), Stephen Shepherd (seventh respondent), Kim Richardson (eighth respondent) and Annette O'Neill (the seventeenth respondent, who gave evidence before the AAT). The Court orders that the claims against them are dismissed pursuant to r.13.10(a) of the Rules as the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceedings or claims against them. Scott v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 2055 at [21] . Similarly the Court orders that the claim against Annette O'Neill (the seventeenth respondent) is dismissed. She was a witness before the AAT.</sentence>
