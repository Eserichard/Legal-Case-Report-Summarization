<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 634">As to the third of the factors to be taken into account pursuant to O 82 r 7(c), it is difficult to form any firm view as to whether the proceeding would be more likely to be " heard and determined earlier in the Federal Magistrates Court " than in this Court. As was the case, however, in Kheir's Financial Services Pty Ltd v Aussie Home Loans Ltd [2008] FCA 1602 at [6] per Jagot J, there is no reason to conclude that any hearing would be delayed if the matter were transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court. </sentence>
