<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 485">On 4 August 2009 I determined that the Victorian No 1 Branch ("the Branch") of the Health Services Union of Australia ("the Union") had ceased to function effectively and I approved a scheme to rectify this position: see Health Services Union [2009] FCA 829. These orders were made pursuant to s 323 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (Cth) ("the Act"). Part of the scheme involved a spill of all elected officers in the branch and the conduct of fresh elections. Those elections were to be held in October 2009. Paragraph 5 of the scheme provided that: 
 
 "The officers elected under the Scheme shall hold office until the conclusion of the elections for offices conducted in accordance with the Rules in 2014. " 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1294">Because of internal disputes, the Victoria No 1 Branch ("the Branch") of the Health Services Union ("the Union") became dysfunctional. As a result the Union applied to the Court to approve a scheme which would enable the Branch to function effectively. On 4 August 2009, such a scheme was approved by the Court: see Health Services Union, in the matter of the Health Services Union [2009] FCA 829. Under the scheme, the National Executive of Union declared all elected offices in the Branch vacant and an Administrator was appointed pending the conduct of elections. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1015">The effect of these provisions is that all of the relevant sections of the former Sch 1 of the WR Act which governed the present application are now to be found (with inconsequential amendments such as the renaming of the office of "Industrial Registrar" to that of "General Manager") in the cognate provisions of the FWRO Act. See Tracey J in Re; Health Services Union [2009] FCA 829 (4 August 2009) at [9]. </sentence>
