<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 252">The decision in Quinn v Martin [1977] FCA 11 ; (1977) 16 ALR 141 , Ian Seymour v Stawell Timbers Pty Ltd [1985] FCA 236 ; (1985) 70 ALR 391 and Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v South Cross Clothing Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 325 were referred to in support of the proposition that "Provided all breaches of a particular term of the Award arise out of the same course of conduct, even if they involve different employees, they must be treated as a single breach. This is clearly supported by authority (Quinn v Martin)" 
In the present case it has not been shown that all breaches of particular terms arose out of the same course of conduct. Therefore it has not been shown that the breaches relating to groups of employees were single breaches. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1417">RailCorp submitted that I should do so as all of the breaches related to cl 22.1 of the 2005 agreement. All arose out of RailCorp's mistaken belief that part of cl 3.10 of the 2002 agreement continued in force and qualified RailCorp's obligations under cl 22 of the 2005 agreement. All related to positions rather than individual employees. All were a consequence of one course of "multifaceted conduct" ( Klousia v TKM Investments Pty Ltd [2009] FMCA 208 at [75] citing Wells J in Attorney-General (SA) v Tichy (1982) 30 SASR 84 at 92---3, Gibbs v Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of the City of Altona [1992] FCA 374 ; (1992) 37 FCR 216 , Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 citing Quinn v Martin [1977] FCA 11 ; (1977) 16 ALR 141 at 143---145; Seymour v Stawell Timber Industries Pty Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 241 at 244 and 266-267, and Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Southern Cross Clothing Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 325 at [28] ). According to RailCorp, the facts in Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd (2007) 166 IR 33; [2007] FCA 1384 (affirmed in Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan (2008) 168 FCR 383 ; [2008] FCAFC 70) are distinguishable. In that case the employer applied duress to employees on separate occasions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1965">12 In the principal proceeding, the applicant sought the imposition of penalties against Morrison Clothing pursuant to s 719 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the WR Act ") for breaches of clauses 46 and 48 of the Clothing Trades Award 1999 . Clauses 46 and 48 regulate the terms and conditions of outworkers. The Award is intended to regulate the use of outworkers in the clothing industry to ensure that outworkers receive their minimum entitlements. The relevant provisions of the Award were specifically designed to remedy the exploitation of this vulnerable group of workers: see Clothing Trades Award 1982 Print R2749 and cf the observations of Marshall J in Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Southern Cross Clothing Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 325 . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 9">This is clearly supported by authority ( Quinn v Martin [1977] FCA 11 ; (1977) 16 ALR 141 at 143 - 145, Seymour v Stawell Timber Industries Pty Ltd (1985) 70 ALR 391 at 394 and 416 - 417, and Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Southern Cross Clothing Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 325 at [28] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 7">In my view, Mr O'Grady's submissions do not give effect to s.719(2). Provided all breaches of a particular term of the Award arise out of the same course of conduct, even if they involve different employees, they must be treated as a single breach. This is clearly supported by authority ( Quinn v Martin [1977] FCA 11 ; (1977) 16 ALR 141 at 143 - 145, Seymour v Stawell Timber Industries Pty Ltd (1985) 70 ALR 391 at 394 and 416 - 417, and Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Southern Cross Clothing Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 325 at [28] ). 15. On the evidence as agreed each of the first five breaches in respect of Mr Sorrosa arose out of the same course of conduct as the five breaches concerning Ms Cabisidan: 
 
 
 &#8226; both Mr Sorrosa and Ms Cabisidan were recruited by the same Philippines recruitment agent as a result of a shortage of chefs in Canberra
 &#8226; they signed similar contracts of employment with the Corporation
 &#8226; both contracts provided for employment as chefs under precisely the same conditions under the Award
 &#8226; both employees arrived in Australia on the same day
 &#8226; both were employed for the same period
 &#8226; the terms of the Award were breached in the same manner for each of the employees.</sentence>
