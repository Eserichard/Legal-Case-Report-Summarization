<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 132">As the Minister submits, the question as to whether the applicant had the right to enter and reside in India was a question of fact for the Tribunal ( V856/00A v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1018 ; (2001) 114 FCR 408 at [27] per Allsop J, Applicants in V 722 of 2000 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 1059 at [32] per Ryan J, SZERD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 560 , SZFBO v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 291 at [26] per Emmett J and SZGBY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 35 at [9] per Moore J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1501">The [Tribunal] rejected the applicant's evidence that her Syrian passports had been acquired through means of bribery. [31] Findings as to questions of foreign law, such as the interpretation of treaty obligations between states, are generally understood to constitute a question of fact reserved for the [Tribunal] as part of its fact-finding function. [32] Even had the [Tribunal] erred in its consideration of the country information relevant to this question, which the first respondent does not concede, such an error would not constitute an error going to jurisdiction unless the Tribunal's finding was not open to it: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 , per Mason J at 355-356. [33] The third ground should fail. Reasoning
 The Tribunal's statutory duty of communication
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 65">In SZGPY v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 35 at [9] Moore J observed that the Tribunal's construction of the treaty was a question of fact and not one of legal error going to jurisdiction. His Honour held that the construction adopted was open to the Tribunal on the facts. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 1772">5. The applicant then applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for a review of the Tribunal decision. That application was dismissed on 
22 nd September 2005 by Driver FM (see SZGBY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [1] ). The applicant then appealed. His appeal was dismissed by Moore J on 6 th February 2006 (see SZGBY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 311">First, it is notable that, as in SZGBV v MIMIA [2006] FCA 35 , it was no part of the applicant's case before the Tribunal that he could not enter and reside in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FMCA 1097">The third case cited by Mr Cox was SZGBY v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 35 (" SZGBY ") at [9], where Moore J observed that the Tribunal's construction of the Treaty was a question of fact and not one of legal error going to jurisdiction.</sentence>
