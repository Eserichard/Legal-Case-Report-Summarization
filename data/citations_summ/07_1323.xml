<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VCC 583"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 168">42 The two cases cited by the primary judge --- Davis 118 FCR 170 and Samaras [2007] FCA 1323 ; (2008) 15 ANZ Ins Cas 90-133 were directed towards the "factual inquiry" and therefore not strictly authority for his Honour's ultimate finding.  31 His Honour also referred to the decision of Gordon J in Samaras v Australian Retirement Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1323 ; (2008) 15 ANZ Ins Cas 90-133 , in which her Honour noted it was common ground between the parties that "the relevant time for the Tribunal to consider [the applicant's] claim for TPD benefit was the date of the decision of the Trustee" (at [18]). His Honour therefore concluded that the Tribunal had "conducted its review by reference to the wrong date" (at [102]). His Honour noted that there was no evidence as to the terms of the trust deed or the insurance policy as at the date when the review needed to be conducted. Nevertheless his Honour allowed the appeal, quashed the decision of the Tribunal and remitted the matter for determination according to law. It would seem that his Honour envisaged that evidence of the later versions would be placed before the Tribunal on rehearing and that a submission supported by evidence was not put to his Honour that remission was pointless because the definitions in the trust deed and in the insurance policy had not materially changed.
  43 In Davis 118 FCR 170 the issue was whether the claimant's satisfaction of the TPD definition should be determined at 19 February 1999 (six months from the date on which he last worked) or 28 June 2000 (the date on which the trustee's decision was affirmed). Heerey J adopted the latter approach. In Samaras [2007] FCA 1323 ; (2008) 15 ANZ Ins Cas 90-133 , Gordon J did not substantively address this question at all. Her Honour merely set out that it was common ground between the parties that "the relevant time for the Tribunal to consider Mr Samaras' claim for TPD benefit was the date of the decision of the Trustee" (at [18]). In accordance with this common ground, her Honour later held that "the Insurer and the Trustee were required to consider the medical evidence that existed at the time of their decision" (at [37]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 981">The relevant date for consideration of the operation of the total and permanent disablement definition in the policy is the date of the decision of the trustee; see Samaras v Australian Retirement Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1323 at [18] per Gordon J and Davis v Rio Tinto Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (2002) 118 FCR 170 at [15] per Heerey J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] SCTA 46">In a subsequent case in the Federal Court, Samaras v Australian Retirement Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1323 [31 August 2007], the decision in Auspine was referred to. The definition of disablement in the Colonial Mutual policy in this case was similar to but not exactly the same as that in the policy considered in Auspine . In paragraph 37 of the judgment of Gordon J in Samaras , it is said in relation to the definition of disablement in question in that case: 
 
37 If an illness or illnesses of the kind described could be identified, then the second limb of the test becomes relevant --- consideration of medical and other evidence to determine whether it was unlikely that Mr Samaras would ever be able to engage in any regular remunerative work for which he was reasonably fitted by education, training or experience. This second limb requires consideration of medical and other evidence limited to the illness or illnesses identified under the first limb but not limited in time to the period prior to the cessation of Mr Samaras' employment. The Insurer and the Trustee were required to consider the medical evidence that existed at the time of their decisions, namely June 2005 and August 2005. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 706">Although not explicitly stated, it would seem that the Tribunal regarded its task as reviewing the decision of the Trustee as at the last mentioned date, an approach I think was correct. The system of review under the Act is to be distinguished from claims made by an insured under a policy: cf Giles v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (1986) 4 ANZ Ins Cas 60-751. See also Samaras v Australian Retirement Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1323 per Gordon J at [18].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] SCTA 42">However, in a Federal Court decision some 10 months earlier, which was not referred to in Halloran , a different conclusion was reached in relation to a similar definition. That case was Auspine Staff Superannuation Pty Ltd v Henderson [2006] FCA 1281 (26 October 2006), in which it was decided that the Insurer's decision had to be based on the Insured's circumstances at the time the Insurer was making the decision. Similar conclusions appear to have been reached in Oberlechner v Watson Wyatt Superannuation Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 906 (16 August 2007) and Samaras v Australian Retirement Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1323 (31 August 2007).
