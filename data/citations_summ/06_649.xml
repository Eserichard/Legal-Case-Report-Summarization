<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] AATA 383">In the primary decision [2] of Seymour's case , the Federal Court (Jacobson J) explained the operation of the relevant sub-sections in s 303 and came to the conclusion that the proper construction of both sub-ss 300(4)(a) and (7) is that the extension of an agent's registration ceases when the respondent decides to refuse the application for registration, even if that decision is later stayed. [3] The Federal Court, in its decision, also addressed the same argument the applicant has made in this matter; that is, that the Tribunal has power to grant a stay pursuant to s 306AA. Jacobson J explained s 306AA is not concerned with a stay of a decision refusing an application for registration which was deemed continuing by force of sub-ss 300(1) and (4). Section 306AA only deals with orders staying a decision under s 303 to cancel or suspend the registration of an agent who has already been registered for the current year, not a deemed registration. [4] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] AATA 1495">The respondent submitted that the effect of sub-sections 300(4) and (7) is that Mr Vo's registration as a migration agent ceased when MARA made its suspension decision on 23 April 2007. The grant of a stay by the AAT in relation to the suspension decision could not "re-enliven" Mr Vo's registration. It was noted that the AAT has previously considered the application of section 300(4) and (7) in Re Seymour and the Migration Agents Registration Authority [2006] AATA 369 ; (2006) 91 ALD 93 ("Seymour ") and reached a similar view. The AAT's decision in Seymour was later affirmed by the Federal Court in Seymour v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2006] FCA 649 ; (2006) 91 ALD 610 and the Full Federal Court in Seymour v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2007] FCAFC 5 ; (2007) 93 ALD 253. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCAFC 5">1 This is an appeal from the judgment of Jacobson J handed down on 31 May 2006 which dismissed an application by Mr Seymour for review of a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal"): Seymour v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2006] FCA 649. On 27 April 2006, the Tribunal dismissed an application by Mr Seymour for a stay of a decision made by the Migration Agents Registration Authority ("the Authority") on 20 February 2006. On this date, the Authority decided to refuse an application by Mr Seymour for re-registration as a migration agent for the 12 month period from 24 May 2005 to 23 May 2006.</sentence>
