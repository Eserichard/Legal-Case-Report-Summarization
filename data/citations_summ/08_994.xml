<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 996">Similar issues arose in Thompson v IGT (Australia) Pty Limited [2008] FCA 994. The applicant in that case objected to seeing a psychiatrist when called upon to do so by his employer. At [38] Goldberg J noted that the applicant was not a doctor and whether it was appropriate or necessary for the applicant to have a psychiatric assessment or to have a meeting with a psychiatrist was a matter ultimately for the doctors to determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1122">In the circumstances it is appropriate that there be no order as to costs of the application for an extension of time (see, by way of analogy, Thompson v IGT (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 994 at [63] - [65]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1140">3 I agree with the approach which was recently stated by Goldberg J in Thompson v IGT (Australia) Pty Limited [2008] FCA 994 at [63] to [65]:
 
 
 '63 The respondent seeks an order that the applicant pay its costs of the application for interlocutory relief.</sentence>
