<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] ACTSC 60">25. In relation to lawyers, the precise circumstances cannot be enumerated. As was said by Nicholson J in Re Wainter Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 656 at [5] 
 
 Consequently, the Court can grant an injunction restraining solicitors acting for a party in circumstances where those solicitors lack the requisite qualities of independence and objectivity. "There can sensibly be no closed list of circumstances which would justify the exercise of what, on any view, must be regarded as an exceptional jurisdiction or power": Tottle Christensen v Westgold Resources NL [2003] WASCA 224 at [4] per Malcolm CJ, Murray and Anderson JJ. It is no answer that the solicitors' interests coincide with the client's interests: Clay v Karlson at 496. This Court has implied power to regulate the conduct of legal practitioners appearing before it to the extent necessary to ensure observance of their duties to the Court and the integrity of its procedures: De Pardo v Legal Practitioners Complaints Committee [2000] FCA 335 , 97 FCR 575 at 595 [53] per French J, with whom Whitlam J agreed at 598 [60].
