<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] WASC 244">49 The applicants submit that the resources of courts are limited and they should only be called upon by the parties to resolve matters which are clearly in dispute. In this regard, in Labocus Precious Metals Pty Ltd v Thomas (No 3) [2007] FCA 1346 , Allsop J observed:
 
 I do think, however, that both sides lost sight of the proper way to run litigation. The courts are a scarce and expensive public resource. Litigation is necessarily expensive for the parties.</sentence>
