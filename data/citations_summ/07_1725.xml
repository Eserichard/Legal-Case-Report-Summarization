<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 999">The question of significant economic hardship that threatens a person's capacity to subsist has been said by Tamberlin J is SZBQJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [8] to reflect an emphasis which denotes the ability to continue to exist or remain in being. [9] The level of threat must be such as to challenge the individual's capacity to exist or remain in being, (see SZIGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ). [10] The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant had suffered serious harm in the sense contemplated by 
sub-s.91R(2). This is a conclusion based on applying the law to the facts as found by the Tribunal. It is a factual decision upon which there was evidence which would enable the Tribunal to arrive at those facts and, of course, it is well known that fact finding is a task for the Tribunal, not for the Court conducting judicial review.
