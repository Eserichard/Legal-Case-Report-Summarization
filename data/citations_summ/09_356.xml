 R v NGUYEN 
 [2010] SASCFC 23 
 
 
 Court of Criminal Appeal: Vanstone, White and Kelly JJ 
 
 
 VANSTONE and KELLY JJ: This is an appeal against the conviction of the appellant by verdict of a jury of two counts of trafficking in a controlled drug contrary to s 32(3) of the Controlled Substances Act 1984 (SA) ("CSA").  The final matter to note before turning more specifically to the appellant's submissions is the stringency of the test of unreasonableness which the courts apply in this context. Diplock LJ in Mixnam's Properties Ltd v Chertsey UDC [17] expressed the proper approach in a way which has been followed by a number of Australian authorities: 
 
 Thus, the kind of unreasonableness which invalidates a by-law is not the antonym of "reasonableness" in a sense in which that expression is used in the common law, but such manifest arbitrariness, in justice or partiality that a court would say "Parliament never intended to give authority to make such rules; they are unreasonable and ultra vires ". [18] 
 

Thus a litigant who claims that delegated legislation is invalid on the grounds of unreasonableness faces a formidable task. The cases in which delegated legislation have been held to be invalid on these grounds are rare. [19]
