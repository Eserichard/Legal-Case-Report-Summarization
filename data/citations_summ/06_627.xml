<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 8">In respect to ground 2, no s 424A(1) obligations arose in the present case. The matters particularised in the amended application as being part of the reasons for decision arose from the Applicant's testimony before the Tribunal. That testimony constituted information that was given by the Applicant to the Tribunal for the purpose of her application for review and was thereby excepted from s 424A(1) obligations by reason of s 424A(3)(b): NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41]- [64]; VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 at [48] ; SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35]. Further, the Tribunal's appraisal of that testimony was not information: SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [18] . Accordingly, in circumstances where no s 424A(1) obligations arose there can be no jurisdictional error based on s 424AA and in any case there is insufficient evidentiary basis for inferring a breach of s 424AA: SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [19] - [21]; NAOA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 241 at [21] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1316">In any event, the Tribunal decision was based on the applicant's oral evidence given at the Tribunal hearing, considered in the light of independent country information. Both the applicant's oral testimony and country information fall respectively within the statutory exemptions to the Tribunal's obligations under s.424A(1) , being information that " the applicant gave for the purpose of the application for review ": s424A(3)(b) , and information that " is not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member" : s.424A(3)(a). I accept the submission by the first respondent on this matter that: Neither source of information was subject to s 424A(1) obligations. In respect to the Applicant's testimony, that was given by the Applicant for the purpose of his application for review: see NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41] --- [64]; VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at [48] ; SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] . In respect to the country information, that was not specifically about the Applicant or another person: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572 ; QAAC of 2004 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCAFC 92. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1136">The first respondent's primary argument was that the information in issue was given to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review in the course of the Tribunal hearing as considered in NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41] --- [64], VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at [48] and SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] .  Subject to this qualification, each item can be characterised as information that would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review in s.424A(1) , determined in advance and independently of the Tribunal's particular reasoning as suggested in SZBYR . These matters were clearly relevant to the question of relocation, which was the critical issue in this case (and see SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [29] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 540">Mr Johnson submits that the passport detail was not "information" that would enliven the operation of s.424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act") because it was exempt by s.424A(3)(b). Mr Johnson relied on SZDPY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] per Kenny J: [35] It is clear that the appellant specifically provided the Tribunal with his educational details. I reject the appellant's submission that the information does not fall within s 424A(3)(b) because it was given in response to questions in the nature of 'cross-examination'. The Tribunal's questions were specific and arose, naturally enough, from the appellant's visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 332">The applicant argues that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error because the interview document was information that was required to be provided to the applicant pursuant to the provisions of s.424A(1) of the Act. Section 424A is explained by Kenny J in SZDPY v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 627 at [28] and [29]: "[28] Section 424A of the Act requires the Tribunal to give the applicant, in the way the Tribunal considers appropriate, particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review, to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that the applicant understands why it is relevant, and to invite the applicant to comment on it: s 424A(1). The information and invitation must be given by a prescribed method: s 424A(2). Section 424A does not apply to certain kinds of information, being information that is not specifically about an applicant and is just about a class of persons, or information that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application, or non-disclosable information: s 424A(3). [29] The Court in SZEEU accepted that the word 'information' in s 424A refers to "knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the Tribunal": see SZEEU at [23]-[25] per Moore J, at [94], [157], [171] per Weinberg J and [205] per Allsop J.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 319">32 Turning to the Minister's alternative argument based on s 424A(3)(b) , I agree that the appellant "gave" the relevant information because he confirmed at the hearing that the bond was provided by his friends. It is not to the point that the Tribunal may have already been in possession of the information or that it was provided by the appellant in answer to the Tribunal's questioning: SZCJD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 609 at [42] - [43], see also SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] , NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 at [61] .</sentence>

26 In respect to the second ground of appeal, the first respondent submitted that there was no error in the finding made by the Federal Magistrate and that the information complained of fell within the ambit of s 424A(3)(b): NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41] --- [64]; VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at [48] ; SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] . The first respondent further contended in reliance upon SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 that, in any event, the information itself did not form part of the reason for decision but rather it was the Tribunal's appraisal of that information as being inconsistent with the appellant's claims to have suffered past persecution that was the reason for decision.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 241">13 Information provided to the Tribunal by someone other than the applicant has been treated as having been given by the applicant for the purposes of an application where it has been adopted by him or her. See SZEEU (2006) 150 FCR at [91] and SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [36] ( SZDPY ). Similarly, it has been held that an applicant can incorporate material by reference so that it becomes part of the information given by him or her for the purpose of the application. See for example SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 and VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FMCA 2018">Mr Mitchell contends that the reason for the Tribunal decision was that the applicants' claims were not plausible in light of the husband's testimony, their visitor's visa application and country information about India. The Tribunal's appraisal of the plausibility of their claim was not subject to s.424A(1) of the Act as that appraisal was not "information": SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [17] - [25]. Mr Mitchell contends that the applicant husband's testimony was given for the purposes of his application for review, notwithstanding that the answers given in response to questions asked by the Tribunal may have been informed by material taken from their visitor's visa application: NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41]- [64]; VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 at [48] ; SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] . I agree with Mr Mitchell's submission that the applicant husband's testimony was therefore exempt from s.424A(1) by reason of s.424A(3)(b). Significantly, the information conveyed in the visitor's visa application relied upon by the Tribunal was put to the applicants in the letter inviting them to comment on certain information dated 23 October 2006 (CB 70-71). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCAFC 162">42 In concluding that this issue should be resolved in favour of the Minister, his Honour relied specifically upon the reasoning in SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] and in SZHFC at [24]---[25]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 1092">25 The finding of the Tribunal was based upon its non acceptance of the appellant's testimony. The Tribunal based its findings upon information which the appellant provided to the Tribunal for the purposes of the application for review. Accordingly it falls within the exception to s 424A(1) of the Act contained in s 424A(3)(b) of the Act: see SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FMCA 1671">37. Both of these matters were raised with the applicant at the Tribunal hearing as part of its "concerns" with the applicant's claims and evidence. This was consistent with the Tribunal's obligation to raise with the applicant additional issues to those identified by the original decision maker to the extent that they were determinative against the applicant (see SZBEL at [35]). Further, to the extent it could be said that such information was information that was the reason, or a part of the reason for the decision under review, then such information which was not specifically about the applicant or another person falls within the exception contained in s.424A(3)(a) of the Act from the obligations set out in s424A(1) of the Act ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 , QAAC of 2004 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCAFC 92). The applicant's answers to questions arising from this information of course was information given by the applicant herself to the Tribunal such that it fell within the exception contained in s.424A(3)(b) from the obligation in s.424A(1) in that they were given to the Tribunal for the purposes of her application for review. Notwithstanding that the Tribunal's questions may, in the case of the independent country information referred to at CB 88.6, have been information already referred to in the delegate's decision (see CB 43.3) ( SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] ). </sentence>

Further, I note submissions by Mr Johnson today and agree with him that to the extent that it could be said that the Tribunal relied on information arising by way of "cross-examination" of the applicant at the hearing before the Tribunal, then this is information falling within that exception from the obligation pursuant to s.424A(1) of the Act ( SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 , SZJCD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 609). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FMCA 1559">Mr Cox submits that even without considering the impact of SZBYR , information of this nature is exempt from disclosure under s.424A(3)(b) , as it was information given by the applicant for the purposes of the review. In SZEEU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 , the Tribunal became aware from other sources that the applicant had applied for a business visa to come to Australia. Nevertheless, the Full Court concluded that this had been discussed with the applicant at the Tribunal hearing, resulting in the information having been provided for the purposes of the application: SZEEU at [91], [173] and [264]. In SZDOY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 the Tribunal relied upon the applicant's educational and employment history to conclude that he could relocate. Justice Kenny concluded that this information was provided by the applicant at the Tribunal hearing: SZDOY at [35]. Further, that the applicant did not merely adopt the contents of the visa application information as a whole. but "separately and specifically gave detailed information concerning his education and employment to the Tribunal": SZDOY at [36]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FCA 1224">28 The manner in which the appellant's counsel has argued the matter has been somewhat unusual. He has conceded that in confirming the details of his protection visa application at the Tribunal hearing, the appellant thereby gave the information in the visa application statement "for the purpose of the application" to the Tribunal: cf s 424A(3)(b). It is not for me to consider whether this concession needed to be, or was properly, made: see SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [29] ff. It was then said that the inconsistencies between the statement and the oral evidence were not required to be notified under s 424A of the Migration Act either because of s 424A(3)(b) or, in my view, more properly because inconsistencies in evidence given by an applicant are not "information" for the purposes of s 424A: see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18] . </sentence>

 58 In SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627('SZDPY') , Kenny J considered the circumstances in which information provided by the applicant for review during the Tribunal hearing will fall within the exemption in s.424(3)(b).</sentence>

<sentence id="cs18" from="[2007] FCA 826">45 As Young J noted in NBKT at [55], the Full Court's approach in SZEEU to issues of this kind must also take into account its treatment of a similar question in the appeal in SZDXA , also reported with SZEEU . The relevant information in SZDXA was the fact that the appellant had a temporary business visa to Australia. Moore J concluded that, although the Tribunal had acquired this information from sources other than the appellant, the Tribunal had discussed the fact with the appellant at the hearing and the appellant had affirmed that he had entered Australia on a business visa. In this circumstance, Moore J concluded, at 242, that the information fell within 424A(3)(b) and Weinberg J agreed, at 254, observing, at 255, that the adoption of an earlier statement at the hearing can bring that statement within the exception. Allsop J agreed, at 268, with Moore J in relation to SZDXA . The Full Court in NBKT reached a similar conclusion in relation to the information in question in that case: see NBKT at [60]-[63] per Young J. See also SZCJD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 609 at [43] per Heerey J; and SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] per Kenny J.</sentence>

 26. As this passage suggests, the authorities have drawn a distinction between an applicant's general and non-specific affirmation of all information given to the Department in or with a protection visa application, and "specific" pieces of factual information taken by the Tribunal from that material which is put to the applicant, and which he or she expressly or implicitly adopts or affirms its truth (see, for example, Kenny J in SZDPY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] ). 27. In the present case, there are two reasons why I do not accept the submission of the Minister that the applicant "gave" the Tribunal the information that he had not included in his protection visa application a claim that he had an "official" involvement in the April 2004 conference and a "direct and significant role in it".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2007] FMCA 795">As counsel for the first respondent minister submitted, there is no obligation on the Refugee Review Tribunal to provide the applicant with an opportunity to comment upon either of those two categories of information, and the ground, therefore, must fail (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572 and also SZDPY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2007] FCA 648">19 The Federal Magistrate considered the second claimed breach of s 424A(1) of the Act that country information was not put to the appellant. He held, correctly, that the country information fell within the exception set out in s 424A(3)(b). His Honour accepted that the Tribunal relied in part on the information that the appellant left China legally, that the information was provided in the protection visa application and that the appellant's reference in his review application to the statement in the protection visa application did not refer to that information. However, his Honour found the appellant did provide the information that he left China legally at the hearing before the Tribunal. The Tribunal had asked specific questions about the appellant leaving China legally and the appellant had answered those questions. He held that the appellant would have clearly understood the nature and importance of what he was saying and that he had not only acknowledged the information in his protection visa application but "volunteered" that information as to how he left legally. Accordingly he found that the information was excepted by s 424A(3)(b) of the Act . In so finding he considered relevant authority including particularly: NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 744 ; (2005) 87 ALD 357 ; SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 ; SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2007] FMCA 551">Mr. Mitchell submitted further that while some of the information that the Tribunal relied upon was contained in the application for a protection visa (the applicant's employment, travel, and residence information), that the applicant himself also gave this information (with reference to the Tribunal's account of what occurred at the hearing --- CB 71.4 to CB 71.7) to the Tribunal at the hearing. I accept his submission that the Tribunal's reliance on this information does come within the exception in s.424A(3)(b). With reference to SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 (" SZDPY ") (particularly at [35]), the Tribunal relied on answers to questions which, on what is before me, were specific and arose from the applicant's application. I note further the reference in SZDPY on this issue to SZEEU at [91], [173] and [264] for the proposition that where an applicant affirms a fact before the Tribunal, such information comes within the ambit of s.424A(3)(b).

<sentence id="cs26" from="[2007] FMCA 260">Both SZEEU and NAZY suggest that the exception may not apply where the appellant does no more than affirm the accuracy of a statement which contains many diverse pieces of information.

 e) I also note Kenny J. in SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 (" SZDPY "), a matter on appeal from this Court, at [35]: 

 "It is clear that the appellant specifically provided the Tribunal with his educational details. I reject the appellant's submission that the information does not fall within s 424A(3)(b) because it was given in response to questions in the nature of 'cross-examination'.

<sentence id="cs27" from="[2007] FCA 185">In my view, it was this 'information', given as part of the appellant's evidence before the Tribunal, which was relied upon as 'the reason, or part of the reason' for the Tribunal's decision. This 'information' was information which was given for the purpose of the review, within the meaning of s 424A(3)(b) of the Act, because it was given as evidence before the Tribunal. The circumstances of this case fall within the ambit of the decision in SZDPY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627. There was no obligation, therefore, on the Tribunal to provide the appellant with particulars of that information under s 424A of the Act. There was no breach of s 424A of the Act by the Tribunal, and, therefore, no error by the Federal Magistrate in failing so to find.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2007] FMCA 3">In any event, it is clear that the claims were elaborated upon, and not merely passively adopted, by the Applicant in the second hearing.

[17] In doing so, as the Applicant's submissions note, [18] it adopted the words of a document that had been submitted by the Applicant. [19] The document (which the Applicant's submissions refer to as "the Chando memorandum") was a one page reference, headed "To whom it may concern", and apparently signed by the President of a local branch of the Awami League.</sentence>

In that case, the appellant provided answers in response to questions posed by the Tribunal about his educational history. The appellant argued that the information was not subject to the exemption in s 424A(3)(b) because it had been given in response to questions in the nature of 'cross examination' by the Tribunal. Kenny J rejected the appellant's argument. Her Honour found that the Tribunal's questions were specific and arose, naturally enough, from the appellant's visa application, and the appellant gave direct answers. Her Honour noted that the relevant information was simple and could easily be given in response to such questions. Kenny J held that the Full Court's reasoning in SZEEU supports the proposition that where an applicant affirms a specific fact before the Tribunal, that information will be covered by s 424A(3)(b): see SZEEU at 242 [91] per Moore J, at 214 [173] per Weinberg J, and at 268 [264] per Allsop J.

" (which I assume to be SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 [2006] FCA 627 (" SZDPY ")), that he said "built on a statement" contained in SZEEU that if an applicant gives information in response to a question at a hearing before the Tribunal then s.424A(3)(b) is engaged. I understood him to be submitting that this was a situation that went beyond, or was outside, what Jacobson J., had said in NAZY , and which was referred to by Moore J. in SZEEU at [17] and [20], being the proposition that information does not fall within the exception contained in s.424A(3)(b) unless it is put forward as evidence "in chief", and the applicant is aware of the significance of the information. 43.</sentence>

This matter was raised with the first respondent. Smith FM concluded:
