<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1044">Also rejected is a further submission advanced on behalf of Mr Hogno that the manner in which the Tribunal expressed its findings in relation to those facts exposes the Tribunal as erroneously failing to apply the standard of proof of " beyond reasonable doubt ". It may readily be accepted that the requirement as to a state of satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt " is an exacting standard ": Hall v Repatriation Commission [2007] FCA 2021 at [19] per Gyles J. But the repeated references made by the Tribunal in the present proceeding to the standard of proof to be applied, it is concluded, precludes any inference that the Tribunal's reasons when properly read expose any failure to apply the correct test. To place emphasis (as Mr Hogno sought to do) upon particular expressions --- such as "[w]e are satisfied " and " the weight of the evidence " --- as implying the application of a mere civil standard of proof is to read such expressions divorced from the context in which they appear. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 521">

44 In Hall v Repatriation Commission [2007] FCA 2021 at [19] Gyles J said that:
 
 mis-statement of the statutory task pursuant to s 120(1) in the reasons cannot simply be ignored and treated as a slip of the pen. Satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt is an exacting standard, particularly where it is framed in the negative. As Barwick CJ said in Keeley v Brooking [1979] HCA 28 ; (1979) 143 CLR 162 at 169:
 
 " To be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt is, for the purposes of the law, to be certain. "
 (Emphasis in original. )</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 2109">
 
1 In the principal decision ( Hall v Repatriation Commission [2007] FCA 2021) , an issue was reserved as to whether or not the matter would be remitted to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal). 3 In my opinion, that submission is contrary to the principal decision --- see Hall [2007] FCA 2021 at [22] ).</sentence>
