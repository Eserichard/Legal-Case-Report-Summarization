<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 305">The proceedings were commenced in the District Court of New South Wales and were later transferred to the Supreme Court of New South Wales and thence to this Court. This Court's jurisdiction was attracted by reason of the presence of claims under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (TP Act). The claims in defamation and negligence were within the "accrued" jurisdiction of the Court. They have continued to be within the Court's jurisdiction notwithstanding that the claims under s 52 are no longer pressed: see s 65A of the TP Act and my judgment in Bailey v Veda Advantage Information Services and Solutions Ltd (No. 2) [2008] FCA 730. </sentence>
