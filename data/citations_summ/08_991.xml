<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 117">42 In the carefully reasoned judgment of Rares J in Luck v University of Southern Queensland [2009] FCAFC 73 his Honour expressed the opinion that a judgment or order under s 31A(2) that determines that an applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding is interlocutory (at [101]). His Honour carefully reviewed the recent authorities on the question including Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd , White Industries , Berowra Holdings Pty Limited v Gordon [2006] HCA 32 ; (2006) 225 CLR 364 , Simundic v University of Newcastle [2007] FCAFC 144 , Zoia , Re Luck , Cockrell v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 444 , Pham v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCAFC 179 , Owners of The Ship "Shin Kobe Maru" v Empire Shipping Company Inc [1994] HCA 54 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 , Dent v Australian Electoral Commissioner ; [2008] FCAFC 111 ; (2008) 249 ALR 523 , Wills v Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Bonnell v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (No 5) [2008] FCA 991 and Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 567 ; [2009] 72 ACSR 264. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 73">110 In Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at 407-408 [128] Gordon J construed the word "may" in s 31A(1) and (2) as being used in its empowering sense, not in a discretionary sense. Her Honour demonstrated in that part of her reasons that once the moving party on a motion under s 31A had established that the other party had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting or defending the claim or proceedings, the Court had to give the moving party the remedy it sought as provided in s 31A. In other words, once the Court had reached such a finding, the moving party was entitled to judgment in accordance with it. On the other hand, in Bonnell v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (No 5) [2008] FCA 991 at [81] , Graham J held that the word "may" in s 31A confers a discretion: see too Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 567 at [46] - [47] per Besanko J. It is not necessary to reach a final view on this issue in order to deal with this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1969">I will not discuss the authorities in which s 31A has been considered. The emphasis on the word "no" reminds us that "a cautious approach" should be taken to the exercise of the Court's power under s 31A: cf Bonnell v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (No 5) [2008] FCA 991 at [81] per Graham J.
