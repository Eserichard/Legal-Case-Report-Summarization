<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1382">In A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Limited , Gyles J expressed perhaps a more expansive view as to the potential relevance of other unlawful conduct. Referring to a great many previous decisions, His Honour thus concluded: 
 
 [13] A number of findings involving unlawful behaviour by officials related to the CFMEU have been made in recent years, in addition to the other case involving Lane (eg Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 , (1999) 94 1R 231; Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Hamberger [2003] FCAFC 38 ; (2003) 127 FCR 309 ; Alfred v Walter Construction Group Ltd [2005] FCA 497 ; Martino v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union , Magistrates Court of Victoria (Industrial Division), 10 May 2006; Alfred v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union , District Court of New South Wales, 3 March 2004; Hadgkiss v Blevin [2004] FCA 697; [2004] FCA 917 ; Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 524 ; (2007) 162 IR 385 ; Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 1730 ; (2007) ATPR 42-140 ; Cruse v Multiplex Ltd [2007] FCA 2015 ; Cruse v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FMCA 1873 ; and Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 1001 ; (2007) 167 IR 320). Counsel for the CFMEU submits that only building industry cases are relevant, and then only those that involve the relevant divisional branch (the New South Wales Construction and General Divisional Branch), bearing in mind that the Union is an amalgamated federation ( Re Election for Office in the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ; Ex parte Sutton [2002] FCA 971 ; (2002) 115 IR 345 at [23] ). I agree that the classes of case identified are the most relevant, but I do not agree that the other cases are irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 786"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1040">In addition to these matters, the applicant relied on various other decisions as indicative of a prior history on the Union's part. In particular, the applicant argued that the Union had a substantial history of engaging in similar conduct because it had been found to have engaged in unlawful coercion on numerous previous occasions contrary to: s 187AB(1)(b) of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth), citing Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 ; Cruse v Multiplex Ltd [2008] FCAFC 179 ; (2008) 172 FCR 279 and Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 495 ; s 170NC of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act , citing Alfred v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (Decision of Hughes J, NSW District Court, 5 March 2004); Alfred v Walter Construction Group Limited [2005] FCA 497 ; A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 1047 ; (2007) 165 IR 94 ; Cruse v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1267 ; (2008) 175 IR 447 ; and Martino v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (Magistrates Court of Victoria, 10 May 2006); s 298P of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act , citing Hadgkiss v Blevin [2004] FCA 697 ; and Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Hamberger [2003] FCAFC 38 ; (2003) 125 IR 183 ; and s 298S(2)(b) of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act , citing Alfred v Lancsar [2007] FCA 1001 ; (2007) 167 IR 320. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 265">At paragraph [21] of exhibit "A2", the applicant referred to decisions of the Federal Court, including the decision of Jessup J in Wells v Locarno Management Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1034 and the decision of Buchanan J in Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 1001 and said: "21. In cases where parties have agreed on proposed penalties, the Court is not bound to impose those penalties but will do so if it is satisfied that the proposed penalties fall within "the permissible range": Hills v Sutton [2007] FCA 2033 at [7] per Tracey J, Wells v Locarno Management Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1034 at [23] per Jessup J, Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 1001 ; [2007] 167 IR 320 at [15] per Buchanan J. In this respect, the "permissible range" of penalties refers to a range "which would be permitted by the Court, that is, a range within which the penalty is neither manifestly inadequate nor manifestly excessive": Wells at [23] per Jessup J. As Jessup J said in Wells : 'The predictability involved in the resolution of penal proceedings in accordance with a pre-trial agreement reached by the parties is something which should, as a matter of public policy, be regarded as beneficial' (ibid).  At paragraph [21] of exhibit "A2", the applicant referred to decisions of the Federal Court, including the decision of Jessup J in Wells v Locarno Management Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1034 and the decision of Buchanan J in Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 1001 and said: "21.

I agree that the classes of case identified are the most relevant, but I do not agree that the other cases are irrelevant. Ultimately, union officials will act in accordance with the policies of the union. An official of one geographic or industry branch will observe the manner in which policies are applied by the federal body in relation to other branches. These various cases illustrate that the federal body has not been effective in ensuring that officials act in accordance with the law. I note that there is no evidence of offending officials (including Lane) suffering any serious disciplinary penalties.</sentence>
