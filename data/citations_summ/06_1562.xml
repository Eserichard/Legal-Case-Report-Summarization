<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] AATA 302">In the Federal Court in Lobo v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1562 , His Honour Justice Madgwick at [55] outlined the importance of management decision making of the requisite character: To my mind the key points in this passage are that the first appellant's role was that of a subordinate administrative assistant and that she did not satisfy the dual requirements that she be involved in the actual management of the business and in making decisions of the requisite character.  In the matter of Lioe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] AATA 189 , Senior Member Ettinger in oral reasons indicated that a mere perfunctory personal knowledge of a business is a good indicator that a holder is not utilising their required management skills; and therefore, not satisfying their visa obligations. His Honour Justice Madgwick at [55] in the Federal Court case of Lobo v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1562 also emphasised how important it was to be: 
 
 fully cognisant of the overall direction and performance of the business. 
 
 Knowledge of YL's operations within own specified areas of duty
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] AATA 2092">Lastly, the applicant fails to mention that although the original decision in Lobo considered the above factors too narrow, the Tribunal on remittal still held that the visa holder had nonetheless not satisfied the criteria for management. This was upheld in a further appeal to the Federal Court in Lobo v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1562. Madawick J at [54] cited the Tribunal's decision with approval: 
 The evidence supporting the visa applicant's "involvement in the management of that business or those businesses from day to day and in making decisions that affected the overall direction and performance of that business" is essentially her own assertions. The documentary evidence fails to support the proposition that she is a decision maker in the business or that she is even fully cognisant of the overall direction and performance of that business. On balance of the evidence, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the visa applicant "maintained direct and continuous involvement in the management of that business... from day to day and in making decisions that affected the overall direction and performance of that business" in the 12 months prior to the date of application. The Tribunal finds that the primary visa application does not meet clause 845.216.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 1558">In response to the second ground, Mr Markus submits: ...that mere disagreement with the Tribunal's reasons does not amount to irrational and/or illogical reasoning, and in any event, unpersuasive reasoning or "infelicitous phrasing" does not amount to an error of law: A v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 238 and VGAO of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCAFC 68 ; Lobo v The Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1562 at [50] ; and NAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 76 at [31] where it was said that mere "sloppy" reasoning cannot, of itself, demonstrate either lack of bona fides, or unreasonableness going to jurisdiction. </sentence>
