<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 34">62 A new Practice Note, in terms different from that initially referred to by Finkelstein J in Opes Prime , has now been issued for England and Wales. The approach outlined in the new Practice Note was applied by Finkelstein J in Opes Prime at [19]---[20]. His Honour said:
 A new practice statement was published in [2002] 1 WLR 1345 [...] I adopted this practice in In the Application of United Medical Protection Ltd [2007] FCA 631. The purpose of the new practice is to avoid the waste of costs and court time which would result if it were not until the approval hearing that it was determined that classes were wrongly constituted. In England it has been said that this underlying purpose means that if other issues which go to the jurisdiction of the court to approve a scheme (as in Re Savoy Hotel Ltd [1981] 1 Ch 351) , or issues which would lead the court unquestionably to refuse the scheme, should also be dealt with at the convening application: Re T &amp; N Ltd (No 3) [2006] UKHL 54 ; [2007] 1 All ER 851 at 862. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 813">A new practice statement was published in [2002] 1 WLR 1345. Under the new practice the applicant for a scheme meeting must draw to the attention of the court as soon as possible any issue that may arise about the constitution of the meetings or which might otherwise affect the conduct of the meetings. If appropriate, notice must be given to any person affected by the proposed scheme so they may apply to be heard at the convening application. I adopted this practice in In the Application of United Medical Protection Limited [2007] FCA 631. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1571">44 Finally, in United Medical Protection [2007] FCA 631 , Finkelstein J considered that while there might be different categories of membership of the medical defence organisations that were before him (both were companies limited by guarantee, whose members were medical practitioners) there was for each organisation but one "class" for the purposes of s 411 of the Act, because the categories of members were not "so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest" (at [15]). 3 Recent cases in this Court in which transfer orders under s 413 have been made in connection with the approval of compromises or arrangements under Pt 5.1 of the Act include Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind Ltd v RBS.RVIB.VAF [2004] FCA 735 ; (2004) 206 ALR 581 ; SGIC Insurance Ltd v Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 1492 ; (2004) 51 ACSR 470 ; Re Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 208 and In the Application of United Medical Protection [2007] FCA 631 ( United Medical Protection ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 714">
 A brief description of the two schemes for which approval is now sought is to be found in what I said when ordering the convening of the scheme meetings: see In the Application of United Medical Protection Limited [2007] FCA 631. The duty of the court when acting under s 411(6) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) has been explained more than once. Nothing is served by going over old ground.</sentence>
