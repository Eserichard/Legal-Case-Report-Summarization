<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 650">At paragraph 30 of her decision, Senior Member Carstairs said: 
 
 "However, I do not understand either Deputy President in these decisions to be stating that there are no circumstances in which notional entitlement can be considered in the context of the discretion for special circumstances. There are, after all, no fetters on this discretion, except as expressed in s 1237AAD itself. " 
 

 
The view expressed by Senior Member Carstairs in Re Sara has been further reinforced in the Federal Court by Spender J in Oberhardt v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1923. At paragraphs 62-64 of his decision, the learned Judge said:
 
 
 "62 The words in s 1237AAD(b) should not be fettered, or narrowed, in the manner argued for by the respondent and accepted by the Tribunal in this case. 
 63 The view reflected by the Tribunal in Lyster , Huynh , Dobbie , Sara , and QX2006/1 referred to above, to the effect that notional entitlement is not necessarily excluded in considering whether 'special circumstances' exist, for the purposes of s 1237AAD, is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 661">Although the error by Centrelink was not the sole cause of the overpayment, the extent of the Centrelink error ought to be taken into account in considering the exercise of discretion for special circumstances. This is despite the Act providing for administrative error under another head of power. In that regard the Federal Court decision in Oberhardt v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1923 ; (2008) 174 FCR 157 serves to remind that the discretion is a broad one, in which all relevant matters can be considered, even if provision is made for them elsewhere in the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 739">In relation to the second argument of special circumstances, it is difficult to accept that a failure to claim newstart allowance prior to 19 September 2007 satisfies the requirement. Before the SSAT, Mr Gleeson accepted that he was not looking for work prior to September 2007. It is pure conjecture to consider whether he may have been qualified for newstart allowance at 10 May 2007. He had made no claim prior to 19 September 2007. He had received the standard notifications from Centrelink in September 2006, November 2006 and April 2007 reminding him of his obligation to inform Centrelink of any change in the details giving rise to his entitlement to carer payment. In these circumstances, it cannot be accepted that a failure to make a claim for newstart allowance prior to 19 September 2007 amounts to special circumstances for the purposes of s 1237AAD. In cases such as Oberhardt v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1923 it was found appropriate to consider notional entitlement to alternative benefits in considering special circumstances. In this case, apart from the difficulty in being able to find that there was a notional entitlement to newstart allowance between May and September 2007, the failure to meet the obligation to inform of the change in circumstances mitigates against a finding of special circumstances making it desirable to waive the debt. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] AATA 91">Ms Kalpouzos also submitted that there were special circumstances because she had a notional entitlement to NA at the time her enrolment at Charles Sturt University was cancelled. The Federal Court (Spender J) in Oberhardt v Secretary, Department of Education and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1923 (17 December 2008) dealt expressly with the subject of notional entitlement and the exercise of discretion under s 1237AAD of the Act. His Honour said, at paragraphs 62-64: 
 The words in s 1237AAD(b) should not be fettered, or narrowed, in the manner argued for by the respondent and accepted by the Tribunal in this case. ...It follows that, in my view, notional entitlement should not be excluded from the range of available relevant considerations in deciding whether there are "special circumstances" to waive a debt under s 1237AAD.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] AATA 30">I also have borne in mind Mr Lahoud's suggestion during the hearing that he thought he might have been entitled to disability support pension (' DSP ') before he applied for age pension. Had he made a successful claim, the preclusion period might have expired before he reached pension age. Spender J recently held in the case of Oberhardt v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1923 , that a notional entitlement might be taken into account in a claim of special circumstances made under section 1237AAD or its neighbouring provisions of the Act for possible waiver of a debt. I distinguish Mr Lahoud's situation not simply because his claim involves another legislative provision but because there is insufficient evidence before me that Mr Lahoud would have qualified for DSP. Some of his oral evidence suggests otherwise, such as his evidence that he did not undergo surgery recommended by his doctors, which might mean his condition was not fully treated or permanent for the purposes of DSP. </sentence>
