<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] RRTA 184">The Tribunal received a letter from your representative on the [date] December 2010 advising that you did not see a doctor on [date] November 2010 even though you were ill and requesting a rescheduling of the hearing. No other evidence or explanation of your claimed illness has been provided to the Tribunal, nor have any other reasons for your failure to attend the hearing on [date] November 2010. 
 
 The Tribunal notes that the Federal Court of Australia has held that it is up to the applicant to establish the reason for non-attendance at a hearing (SZLBE v MIAC [2008] FCA 1789 at [18] ). Accordingly, in order for the Tribunal to decide under s426A of the Act whether to reschedule the hearing or to make its decision on the review without taking any further action to enable you to appear before it, you are invited to provide further information about the reasons for why you were unable to attend the hearing on [date] November 2010. 
 
 In particular, the Tribunal requests that you provide information about: 
 the nature and symptoms of the illness you claim you were suffering on or about [date] November 2010; its duration; its impact on your ability to attend and participate in the hearing on [date] November 2010; and any other reason why you were unable to attend the hearing on [date] November 2010.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 585">In this case that would mean, as soon as it had been posted. The provision by the Tribunal at the corresponding hearing of an inadequate interpreter is another matter altogether. 
 

 
Given the debate it is not surprising that, in SZLBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1789 at [23] , Middleton J also said that the decision in SCAR " has not met with universal approval ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 327">In this regard, I note that the applicant had already been given some leeway by the Tribunal in relation to the applicant wife's claimed medical difficulties. I agree with the Minister that s.425 did not require the Tribunal to continue to offer the applicant wife the opportunity to attend in circumstances, and particularly, where no medical evidence, despite the specific request by the Tribunal, was submitted to support her claimed severe medical difficulties ( SZLBE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1789 , NALQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 121). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 336">As pointed out for the first respondent, no issue was raised about the wife's non-attendance at the Tribunal hearing in these proceedings. The applicant wife did not attend the hearing today and no issue was raised in this respect by the applicant husband. In any event, consistent with the approach taken in SZLBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1789 and NALQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 121 this is not a case in which the Tribunal's exercise of its discretion under s.426A miscarried or in which there could be said to be a breach of s.425 (cf SZLLY) assuming that these provisions are applicable given that the evidence raised the possibility that the applicant wife had her own protection claims, albeit that she had not brought her application on that basis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 185">The Minister submitted that a (then reserved) decision of Middleton J in SZLBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1789 had some bearing on this issue. In that case the applicant was unwell on the scheduled day. Subsequently the applicant informed the Tribunal that she was sick on the original day and then sought a further adjournment but without providing any basis for that adjournment. Middleton J detected no error in the decision of the Tribunal not to grant the further adjournment. His Honour was prepared to assume the applicability of SCAR but thought that the case before him could be determined on the basis of the correctness of the decision to proceed in the absence of the applicant: [26]-[30]. </sentence>
