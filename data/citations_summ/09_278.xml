<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1080">In addition, on being transferred to a TMF under cl 38.1 of the Trust Deed, GSMA contends that the money in the TMF ceased to be Scheme property on the strength of Treecorp Australia Ltd v Dwyer [2009] FCA 278 ; (2009) 175 FCR 373 (at [11]-[12]) per Gordon J.  Ordinarily, that will identify the basis on which scheme property is held by the responsible entity. 
 

 
 
 49 I am of opinion that ss 601FS(1) and 601FT(1) create a means of ensuring that rights to hold, and rights "in relation to", scheme property pass to and vest in the new responsible entity. This is because ss 601FJ, 601FS(1) and 601FT(1) cause all rights of the former responsible entity "in relation to the scheme" to pass to the new one once changed: cf City Pacific Ltd (In Liq) v Ballandean Investments Pty Ltd [2010] QCA 113 [23], [26] at [9] per Holmes JA with whom McMurdo P and Chesterman JA agreed and Capelli v Shepard [2010] VSCA 2 ; (2010) 264 ALR 167 at 196 [143] , 197 [148] per Dodds-Streeton and Mandie JJA and Byrne AJA; Treecorp Australia Ltd (In Liq) v Dwyer [2009] FCA 278 ; (2009) 175 FCR 373 at 383-384 [46] , [48] per Gordon J. Likewise, those sections novate obligations and liabilities of the former responsible entity "in relation to scheme property" in the new responsible entity. The language of those provisions suggests that the Parliament had novation, not merely assignment, in mind: Olsson v Dyson [1969] HCA 3 ; (1969) 120 CLR 365 at 388-391 per Windeyer J esp at 388; see too Goodridge v Macquarie Bank Ltd [2010] FCA 67 ; (2010) 265 ALR 170 at 197-199 [106] - [114] where I discussed the distinction between novation and assignment in contract.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] WASC 51">57 The plaintiff submits that the property of the Scheme is not limited to scheme property as defined in the Act. The use of the defined term 'scheme property' ensures constant treatment of certain types of property throughout ch 5C of the Act but does not render all other property immaterial. In Treecorp Australia Ltd (in liq) v Dwyer [2009] FCA 278 ; (2009) 175 FCR 373 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 127 Gordon J said:
 
 Significantly, the reference to 'a right, obligation or liability' in s 601FT is not limited to or identified by reference to 'scheme property' as that term is defined in s 9 of the Act. That is not surprising. There will often be, as in this case, contractual arrangements entered into by the responsible entity for the benefit of the scheme which will not constitute scheme property [48]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1081">Secondly, consistent with s 601FC(2) of the Corporations Act , the Constitution provides "Project Property" is held by the responsible entity on trust for the members for the term of Project 5: cl 3.1. The term "Project Property" is defined in Sch 1 to mean: 
 
 
 The Funds, all Investments, assets and any other property acquired throughout the term of the Project using the money or property contributed by Members, but excluding any assets or any other property vested in the Members ... 
 
 

 
The definition acknowledges that there will be "Project Property" (or scheme property) as well as other property connected with the scheme which is not "scheme property": see Treecorp Australia Ltd (in liq) v Dwyer [2009] FCA 278 ; (2009) 175 FCR 373 at [43] . </sentence>
