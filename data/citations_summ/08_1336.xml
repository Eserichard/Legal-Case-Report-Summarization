<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 489">The mere fact that a document is on the Court file is not a sufficient reason to permit or grant leave for its inspection by a person, such as Fairfax, who is not a party. The jurisdiction of the Court ordinarily must be exercised in open court: s 17(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth); Dickason v Dickason [1913] HCA 77 ; (1913) 17 CLR 50 at 51 per Barton ACJ, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy, Powers and Rich JJ. The interests of open justice are not engaged simply because material is on the Court file that has not been tendered or admitted into evidence and ordinarily leave to inspect such material under O 46 r 6(3) will not be granted: Hogan v Australian Crime Commission [2010] HCA 21 ; (2010) 240 CLR 651 at 667 [40] - [41] per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Kiefel JJ (affirming what Emmett J had held: P v Australian Crime Commission [2008] FCA 1336 ; (2008) 250 ALR 66 at 70 [19] - [20]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1060">" Open justice ", it has been said, " is the underlying assumption of s 50 ": P v Australian Crime Commission [2008] FCA 1336 at [55] , [2008] FCA 1336 ; 71 ATR 555 at 565 per Emmett J. And, in that context, the word " necessary " is a " strong word ": Hogan v Australian Crime Commission [2010] HCA 21 at [30] , [2010] HCA 21 ; 240 CLR 651 at 664 per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Kiefel JJ. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] HCA 21">Counsel for the ACC did not oppose the making of that s 50 order. On 19 May 2008 Emmett J made an order under s 50 restricting the publication of the whole of the parts C and E documents, the whole of the documents behind tab A of exhibit DPR-1 and eleven pages behind tab D to the parties and their legal advisers. The order was not expressed as made until further order, but from the transcript preceding the making of the order this appears to have been the intention of the parties [10] . His Honour further ordered Mr Hogan to file any motion for orders under s 50 on or before 9 June 2008. 
  His Honour published his reasons on 29 August 2008 [14] and made further orders. Order 1 of those orders was amended by order of 12 February 2010 made by Emmett J after the hearing in this Court. The result has been to vacate all s 50 orders in the proceeding, and to extend leave, granted to News and Fairfax on 21 August 2008 under O 46 r 6(3) to inspect and copy documents, to the Inference Schedule and the Accounting Advices. It was from the vacation of the s 50 order made on 21 August 2008, restricting publication of the Inference Schedule and the Accounting Advices, that Mr Hogan sought leave to appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court.
  However, if the file material has been admitted into evidence the interests of open justice are engaged. Where, as here, the party in question adduces no evidence of apprehended particular or specific harm or damage, particularly by disclosure of the Accounting Advices as Emmett J noted [28] , leave properly will be granted under O 46 r 6(3).
  Leave of the Federal Court for News and Fairfax to inspect the Inference Schedule and the Accounting Advices should not be given if there remains in force an order made under s 50 which forbids or relevantly restricts their publication. In the absence of such an order, the question in such a case would be whether in circumstances where the evidence was tendered by a particular party that party might successfully oppose the making of an order under O 46 r 6(3) for inspection, upon the ground that the evidence contained material of a personal or private nature. Emmett J distinguished the situation respecting material on the file of the Court but not tendered and admitted into evidence, and said that the interests of open justice were not engaged there and that leave under O 46 r 6(3) should not be granted in such a case [27] . His Honour was correct in that conclusion.
  His Honour said [23] :
 
 
 "I do not consider that the applicant has established that it was only because of the expectation that s 50 orders would continue in perpetuity that the other material in question was tendered. It would be fair to conclude that the applicant's decision to adduce evidence was driven by the object of succeeding in his application against the [ACC]. It is difficult to see how the proceeding could have been prosecuted otherwise than by tender of the material in question. In the absence of the material, it would have been well nigh impossible for the court to understand what the issue was. The court directed the [ACC] to particularise its assertion that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the privileged documents in dispute had been brought into existence in the furtherance of a fraud or commission of an offence. There is no evidence to suggest that the [ACC] was motivated by bad faith of some sort. "

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 822">I am guided by P v Australian Crime Commission [2008] FCA 1336 at [18] - [20] where Emmett J states: [18] In general, the Court is obliged to exercise its jurisdiction in open court. Thus, once material has been admitted into evidence, either as an exhibit or as affidavit or viva voce testimony, the principle of open justice requires that the material be open to and available for the public. That is clear from s 17(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act , which gives statutory force to the principle that justice must be administered publicly in open court and gives recognition to the weight of public interest that attaches to that principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1971">51 On 14 July 2008, Mr Hogan filed an application for orders relating to confidentiality. That motion and an application for access to Court documents by media interests were heard on 20 August 2008 and I published reasons for my conclusions in relation to those matters on 29 August 2008: see P v Australian Crime Commission [2008] FCA 1336. On 3 October 2008, I made an order than Mr Hogan pay 40% of the media interests' costs of their application: see P v Australian Crime Commission (No 3) [2008] FCA 1520.  42 There have been four phases in the conduct of the proceeding. The first concerned the question of whether the Disputed Documents were brought into existence predominantly for the purposes of obtaining or giving legal advice. During part of that phase, before Mr Hogan was joined as an applicant, Mr Stewart was the only applicant. The second phase was concerned with the issue of whether, even if the Disputed Documents were brought into existence for such purposes, the Cox &amp; Railton Exception applied so as to exclude privilege. The third phase involved the question of confidentiality in relation to the Disputed Documents and the identity of Messrs Hogan and Stewart and the question of media access to material on the Court's file (see P v Australian Crime Commission [2008] FCA 1336). The fourth phase has been concerned with the substantive relief claimed by Mr Hogan.</sentence>
