<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 530">Courts exercising the current jurisdiction have identified numerous factors that may be relevant in assessing the appropriate penalty: see, for example, Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 at 228-229 [120] - [123]; Comcare v Commonwealth [2009] FCA 700 ; (2009) 184 IR 441 at 461 [71] ; Comcare v John Holland Rail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 771 ; [2009] FCA 771 ; (2009) 188 IR 415 at 428-429 [136] - [142]; Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 ; (2007) 98 ALD 67 at 68-69 [5] - [7]; and Linfox at 168 [40].

 [32] In the statutory context of the present legislation, Madgwick J has focussed attention upon those considerations relevant to the imposition of a penalty in Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 ... . A member of the Australian Defence Force had there died in November 1994 as a result of heat stress sustained during an army training exercise. His Honour there observed (at [120]): 
 

 
 
 
 [120] Decisions under the cognate New South Wales Act refer to the following considerations among others: 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 (i) the penalty must be such as to compel attention to occupational health and safety generally, to ensure that workers whilst at work will not be exposed to risks to their health and safety;
 (ii) it is a significant aggravating factor that the risk of injury was foreseeable even if the precise cause or circumstances of exposure to the risk were not foreseeable;
 (iii) the offence may be further aggravated if the risk of injury is not only foreseeable but actually foreseen and an adequate response to that risk is not taken by the employer;
 (iv) the gravity of the consequences of an accident does not of itself dictate the seriousness of the offence or the amount of the penalty. In its written submissions and at the hearing, Australia Post submitted that the Court should be cautious about relying on cases from another jurisdiction where the legislation imposes an "absolute liability" to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employees. Its counsel contrasted the terms of s 16(1) of the OHS Act with the language of ss 8 and 28 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW), submitting that the differences should be borne in mind when reading the NSW cases to which Madgwick J referred in Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 and also in considering items (ii), (iii) and (ix) in his list at 228. Referring to Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Limited [1990] HCA 41 ; (1990) 170 CLR 249 at 263, Australia Post observed that, unlike this State legislation, under the OHS Act, "it is more likely that the construction of section 16 requires the Regulator to prove that the employer did not take a reasonably practicable step to protect the health and safety of its employees, rather than the employer prove this question of fact in its defence": see also Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1 ; [2010] HCA 1 ; (2010) 239 CLR 531 at 553-555 [14] - [19]. Australia Post submitted that "the Court should be careful to ensure that it does not cause the facts underpinning the element of the offence to also constitute an aggravation of the offence". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1331">In Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 Madgwick J explained the overriding principle in determining the quantum of penalty as follows: 
 
 The overriding principle in assessing penalty is that the amount of the penalty should reflect the Court's view of the seriousness of the offending conduct in all the relevant circumstances. (at [116]) 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1220">Section 16 was considered by Madgwick J in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207. His Honour observed at [123] that the principles developed in relation to the equivalent New South Wales legislation 'provide useful, analogical, general guidance as to the approach to be taken in consideration of penalties under the Commonwealth Act'. At [120]-123], his Honour identified a number of factors relevant to determining the amount of a pecuniary penalty to be imposed on an employer in respect of a breach of s 16. In summary, those factors include: the maximum penalty set by the legislature; the vindication of the "social and industrial policies of the legislation and its regime of penalties"; the desirability of specific and general deterrence; the extent of the risk and the gravity of the consequences of the breach; the foreseeability of the risk and whether it was in fact foreseen; the encouragement of vigilance; and whether there was neglect of well-known precautions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 793">In Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 , Madgwick J considered (at [123]) that the following matters 'provided useful and logical general guidance as to the approach to be taken in consideration of penalties under the OHS Act: 
 
 (i) the penalty must be such as to compel attention to occupational health and safety generally, to ensure that workers whilst at work will not be exposed to risks to their health and safety;
 (ii) it is a significant aggravating factor that the risk of injury was foreseeable even if the precise cause or circumstances of exposure to the risk were not foreseeable;
 (iii) the offence may be further aggravated if the risk of injury is not only foreseeable but actually foreseen and an adequate response to that risk is not taken by the employer;
 (iv) the gravity of the consequences of an accident does not of itself dictate the seriousness of the offence or the amount of penalty. However the occurrence of death or serious injury may manifest the degree of the seriousness of the relevant detriment to safety;
 (v) a systemic failure by an employer to appropriately address a known or foreseeable risk is likely to be viewed more seriously than a risk to which an employee was exposed because of a combination of inadvertence on the part of an employee and a momentary lapse of supervision;
 (vi) general deterrence and specific deterrence are particularly relevant factors in light of the objects and terms of the Act;
 (vii) employers are required to take all practicable precautions to ensure safety in the workplace. This implies constant vigilance. Employers must adopt an approach to safety which is proactive and not merely reactive. In view of the scope of those obligations, in most cases it will be necessary to have regard to the need to encourage a sufficient level of diligence by the employer in the future.

  His Honour continued on the topic of assessing the quantity of a pecuniary penalty (at [137] and [141]-[143]) to say: 
 
 [137] When it comes to assessing what level of pecuniary penalty should be imposed, the courts have over a number of years, in a number of different regulatory settings, developed criteria that are considered relevant to the formulation of the quantum of a civil pecuniary penalty. Accordingly, in Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 , 162 IR 407 , Madgwick J at [116] emphasised that the overriding principle in assessing penalty is that the amount of the penalty should reflect the Court's view of the seriousness of the offending conduct in all the relevant circumstances. ...
 [141] With respect, like North J, I agree with the observations of Magdwick J and consider these are all relevant criteria to the assessment of a civil pecuniary penalty under the OHS Act. 
 

 
 
 [142] However, I also concur with North J, in his emphasis of the overriding caution expressed by Flick J in Comcare v Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1987 ; (2008) 178 IR 200 , where His Honour said that care must be taken to ensure that any listing of potentially relevant considerations do not themselves become an impermissible substitute for considering the terms of the legislation in issue or an unnecessary constraint upon a discretion conferred in otherwise unconfined terms. 
 

 
 
 [143] I should also add that I consider it is relevant to the assessment of a pecuniary penalty to acknowledge, where it is the case, an admission of contravention and particularly an early admission by a respondent of its liability to the imposition of a remedy under the OHS Act. Where, for example, a respondent in a proceeding such as these early on acknowledges fault and willingness to accept a declaration of contravention, then the respondent will ordinarily be entitled to additional consideration in the assessment of the penalty. In some contexts this process is termed giving credit or "discount" on penalty. There is no statutory entitlements to such credit or a discount but it serves public policy in that it encourages a respondent to act responsibly, and may achieve a reduction in the public resources that would otherwise be required to prosecute the proceedings against the respondent.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1515">Some assistance in considering the appropriate level of penalty in circumstances involving breach of occupational health and safety standards can be found in comments of Madgwick J in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 662 ; [2007] 163 FCR 207. In that decision his Honour took the view that the following considerations provided useful, analogical, general guidance in considering penalties under the Act: 
 
 (i) the penalty must be such as to compel attention to occupational health and safety generally, to ensure that workers whilst at work will not be exposed to risks to their health and safety;
 (ii) it is a significant aggravating factor that the risk of injury was foreseeable even if the precise cause or circumstances of exposure to the risk were not foreseeable;
 (iii) the offence may be further aggravated if the risk of injury is not only foreseeable but actually foreseen and an adequate response to that risk is not taken by the employer;
 (iv) the gravity of the consequences of an accident does not of itself dictate the seriousness of the offence or the amount of penalty. However the occurrence of death or serious injury may manifest the degree of the seriousness of the relevant detriment to safety;
 (v) a systemic failure by an employer to appropriately address a known or foreseeable risk is likely to be viewed more seriously than a risk to which an employee was exposed because of a combination of inadvertence on the part of an employee and a momentary lapse of supervision;
 (vi) general deterrence and specific deterrence are particularly relevant factors in light of the objects and terms of the Act;
 (vii) employers are required to take all practicable precautions to ensure safety in the workplace. This implies constant vigilance. Employers must adopt an approach to safety which is proactive and not merely reactive. In view of the scope of those obligations, in most cases it will be necessary to have regard to the need to encourage a sufficient level of diligence by the employer in the future. This is particularly so where the employer conducts a large enterprise which involves inherent risks to safety;
 (viii) regard should be had to the levels of maximum penalty set by the legislature as indicative of the seriousness of the breach under consideration; 
 (ix) the neglect of simple, well-known precautions to deal with an evident and great risk of injury, take a matter towards the worst case category;
 (x) the objective seriousness of the offence, without more may call for the imposition of a very substantial penalty to vindicate the social and industrial policies of the legislation and its regime of penalties. (at [120]) 
 

 Submissions of the parties as to quantum of pecuniary penalty
  The overriding principle in assessing penalty is that the amount of the penalty should reflect the Court's view of the seriousness of the offending conduct in all the relevant circumstances: Madgwick J in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 662 ; [2007] 163 FCR 207 at [120] . While penalties imposed pursuant to s 16(1) in other cases may provide some guidance, the Court in each case is required to focus on the circumstances before it and not be improperly distracted by the circumstances in other cases which are inevitably different from the circumstances before the Court. As Gray J said in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary -Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; [2008] 165 FCR 560 at [12] - [13]: 
 
 [12] Much of the argument put by counsel for the appellant involved a detailed comparison between the facts of this case and the facts of two other cases in which lower penalties had been imposed in respect of award breaches. The respondent has made extensive submissions in relation to mitigation. As the respondent submits, and I also note, Madgwick J in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 662 ; [2007] 163 FCR 207 listed no considerations favourable to a respondent in respect of assessment of penalty. However in determining a pecuniary penalty for breach of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), French J in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,153 considered issues subjectively relevant to the conduct of the respondent, including: whether the company had a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; and whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 771">When it comes to assessing what level of pecuniary penalty should be imposed, the courts have over a number of years, in a number of different regulatory settings, developed criteria that are considered relevant to the formulation of the quantum of a civil pecuniary penalty. Accordingly, in Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 , Madgwick J at [116] emphasised that the overriding principle in assessing penalty is that the amount of the penalty should reflect the Court's view of the seriousness of the offending conduct in all the relevant circumstances.  The maximum pecuniary penalty that might be imposed in this case is equivalent to $242,000.00. I note that in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 662 a penalty of $198,000.00 was imposed. In Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 , a pecuniary penalty of $20,000.00 was imposed. In Comcare v Postal Logistics Australasia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 1987 ; (2008) 178 IR 200 a pecuniary penalty of $165,000.00 was imposed. In Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 700 , a pecuniary penalty of $210,000.00 was imposed. Save in the National Gallery case, which was a minor matter on any view, the other three pecuniary penalties were imposed where the consequences of contravention were the death of an employee. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 700">Then Mr Livermore referred to two Victorian Court of Appeal cases in addition to reference to the guidance provided by Madgwick J in Trooper Lawrence [2007] FCA 662 ; 163 FCR 207. These references were designed to throw some light on the analysis of the facts in the present case. However, the width of the factual enquiry in each particular case makes comparison with the facts of other cases of rather limited assistance. In Comcare v Commonwealth (2007) 163 FCR 207 ; [2007] FCA 662 ( Trooper Lawrence ) Madgwick J said at [116] --- [123]: 
 116. The overriding principle in assessing penalty is that the amount of the penalty should reflect the Court's view of the seriousness of the offending conduct in all , the relevant circumstances: Coochey v Commonwealth [2005] FCA 1165 ; (2005) 149 FCR 312 and the cases there cited.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1987">32 In the statutory context of the present legislation, Madgwick J has focussed attention upon those considerations relevant to the imposition of a penalty in Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 , 163 FCR 207. A member of the Australian Defence Force had there died in November 1994 as a result of heat stress sustained during an army training exercise. His Honour there observed:
 [120] Decisions under the cognate New South Wales Act refer to the following considerations among others: (i) the penalty must be such as to compel attention to occupational health and safety generally, to ensure that workers whilst at work will not be exposed to risks to their health and safety; (ii) it is a significant aggravating factor that the risk of injury was foreseeable even if the precise cause or circumstances of exposure to the risk were not foreseeable; (iii) the offence may be further aggravated if the risk of injury is not only foreseeable but actually foreseen and an adequate response to that risk is not taken by the employer; (iv) the gravity of the consequences of an accident does not of itself dictate the seriousness of the offence or the amount of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1548">4 In support of the appropriateness of that figure, I am invited to approach what is put forward along the lines discussed by the Full Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993 , [2004] FCAFC 72. That, of course, was a case under a different Act from that which is involved here, and an Act with different objectives. However, insofar as it dealt with the manner in which the Court should approach a statutory penalty where there is an agreement between the parties as to the appropriate penalty, that decision does provide appropriate guidance. I have also been referred to other authorities dealing more closely with questions of occupational health and safety including the recent case of Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia (2007) 162 IR 407 , [2007] FCA 662 , where Madgwick J looked at a number of the factors which have been regarded as relevant by courts dealing with similar legislation in other jurisdictions.</sentence>
