<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VCAT 312">Citing a decision of the Federal Court in Godwin v Repatriation Commission [4] Mr. Masel submitted that it has been repeatedly held that decisions of the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal do not give rise to an issue estoppel, essentially because its decisions are administrative in nature. (VCAT's Administrative Division, including the General List, is essentially the successor to the former Administrative Appeals Tribunal of Victoria). On the other hand, in an earlier decision of the NSW Court of Appeal in Lambidis v Commissioner of Police [5] Kirby P contrasted Federal and State contexts and observed that as a matter of principle it was "difficult in modern circumstances to exclude tribunals from the generation of issue estoppels given the purpose of such estoppels and the nature and work of tribunals today". [6] 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 240">In Godwin , Flick J confirmed that "false in a material particular" should not be interpreted as "deliberately untruthful". Rather, in the context of the Act, it only need be "objectively incorrect". His Honour concluded that s 31(4) of the Act gives power to review a decision where the decision-maker is satisfied that there is evidence, previously before the decision-maker, that was false (i.e. "objectively incorrect") in a material particular. [2] In other words, that state of satisfaction is a condition precedent to the exercise of the review power; probative material is required to be so satisfied.  It is the case that this Tribunal's role when conducting an administrative review is not to examine the delegate's reasoning in reaching his conclusions. Rather, the Tribunal's task is to make the correct or preferable decision taking into account all relevant evidence. I note the delegate concluded that Mr Benson's history to Dr Abusah was false and misleading . [19]  As to the review powers available under s 31(6) of the Act, Flick J said that being satisfied of a " matter that affects the payment of a pension " could include taking into account new evidence relevant to the manner in which the prior decision was made. [3] This did not rule out taking into account material that had been available when the Tribunal had made its earlier decision and, Flick J continued (agreeing with Dowsett J in Repatriation Commission v Richardson [2001] FCA 1626) , the material could be material of which the decision-maker was ignorant at the time of the original decision.  Godwin v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 576 ; (2008) 102 ALD 286 was a judicial review of the use of the s 31 review powers. The respondent had cancelled the veteran's entitlements soon after the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had completed an administrative review confirming them. The particular facts of Godwin are not important; suffice to say that the respondent accepted new evidence---a military historian's report---that sufficiently indicated that an incident relied upon by 
Mr Godwin (involving the sinking of a sampan under gunfire) had not happened. The delegate concluded that the new evidence disproved ("beyond reasonable doubt") the occurrence of a stressful incident. Absent that stressor, the required link between his post traumatic stress disorder and war service was lost. The delegate concluded that evidence upon which previous decisions had been based was false in a material particular, thus enlivening s 31(4) of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 191">60 A statutory phrase common to both s 43(6) of the 1975 Act and the current s 41(3) is the phrase " for all purposes ". In the context of the 1975 Act, this is a phrase which may assume importance: Godwin v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 576 at [16] , [2008] FCA 576 ; 166 FCR 471. For present purposes, the decision of the Tribunal is also taken to have had effect as from December 2003 " for all purposes " -- including for the purposes of determining whether or not there has been delay.</sentence>
