<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 704">I do not accept that the overarching agreement as pleaded is an artificial construct. The use of such an overarching agreement said to be implemented by subsequent acts is not circular as alleged by the APP overseas respondents (see for example Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617 ; (2007) 244 ALR 673 at [41] ---[47] per Heerey J). There is repeated reference in the evidence to the "AAA Club". There is evidence that meetings did occur between competitors in the industry. They occurred on a regular basis. They were the subject of group emails. Emails before and after the meetings, as well as evidence of what occurred at the meetings, included references to the pricing of paper and whether it should be raised or maintained. It cannot be said, nor is there any evidence to suggest, that they were social meetings or that there was any matter other than the pricing of pulp paper that those participants regularly met to discuss. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 715">None of the customers appears to have made any complaint about the conduct of Patrick and P&amp;O notwithstanding the fact that approximately seven years have passed since it was first made known to them. This is not to understate the seriousness of the conduct which has been admitted but it does distinguish it from the clandestine behaviour which is at the heart of price fixing cartels. It is therefore a factor (though of course not the only one) which informs the imposition of a much lower penalty than was ordered in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industry Holdings Pty Limited (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617 ; (2007) ATPR 42-185 and ACCC v Qantas. Other relevant factors include those that are referred to at [92]---[106] of the Joint Submissions set out above. In addition, as is stated in the Joint Submissions, the admissions of liability have been made well before the hearing and will result in significant saving of court time, costs and expenses to the Commission. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1488">
 
12 I accepted that a separate penalty should not be imposed on Ms Riggs, despite her orchestration of the conduct. As sole shareholder of Oobi Baby, Ms Riggs will feel the burden of the penalty imposed against the company. In the 2007/2008 financial year, Ms Riggs drew a salary of $50,000, having previously drawn $20,000 per annum since the company's inception in 2005. Ms Riggs' husband likewise also draws a salary of $50,000. When the penalty is accounted for they will take less from the company. In these circumstances it is a legitimate course to avoid punishing Ms Riggs twice over for what is, in effect, the same conduct: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617 ; (2007) 244 ALR 673 at [294] , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Commercial and General Publications Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 1349 ; [2002] ATPR 41-905 at [27] - [29], Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 997; [2000] ATPR 41-777 at [13]. I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein. Associate:

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1028">As stated in relation to of penalties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) " it is legitimate to avoid double counting where an individual contravenor is an owner of a corporate contravenor " ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617 ; (2007) 244 ALR 673 at [294] per Heerey J and see Canturi and Another v Sita Coaches Pty Ltd and Another [2002] FCA 349 ; (2002) 116 FCR 276). Mr Clarke did not submit that any penalty should be imposed only on the company on the basis that the burden of such penalty would fall on him personally. Such a possibility was not addressed by the applicant, who sought the imposition of two mid-range penalties on the second respondent. There is no evidence before the Court about Mr Clarke's situation or the size or attributes of the first respondent (except that it operates the Motel) and that Mr Clarke is the " sole owner ", director and secretary of the first respondent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1119">14 Mr Salfinger also made an application that I disqualify myself on the grounds of apprehended bias, the main ground of which appeared to be that I had sat as the trial judge on the hearing of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's claim against Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd, the substantive judgment in respect of which was Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617 ; (2007) 244 ALR 673. The further details alleged by Mr Salfinger in that respect are scandalous and do not bear repetition. I reject the apprehended bias claim. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 575">14 Although the attribution of the statements to the ACCC is acknowledged to be incorrect, counsel for Maurice Blackburn sought to minimise the importance of such an attribution. Counsel argued that the ACCC had made several statements in various publications which, taken together with inferences which can be drawn from the judgment of Heerey J in the proceeding between the ACCC and the Visy parties and others (see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617) , support the inference that the ACCC held a view that an overcharge in the order of 10 per cent existed in this case. Counsel for Maurice Blackburn also submitted that there was some qualification of the range of between 8 and 23 per cent overcharge in the Further Amended Statement of Claim at [100]-[103], which points to the necessity for discovery before damages can be further particularised.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1373">I have referred already to the requirements of s 76(1) and to the considerations it includes amongst matters relevant for the Court to have regard to in determining an appropriate pecuniary penalty. I need not repeat them. Additionally, a considerable body of authority has enlarged upon the principles governing the imposition of pecuniary penalties. Those principles were helpfully distilled by Kenny J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v TEAC Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1859 at [16] . Her Honour there said: 
 "The relevant principles governing the imposition of pecuniary penalties are discussed in Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 at [60] - [75]; Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,151-52, 154; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Consumer and Competition Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1997) 71 FCR 285 at 290-295; J McPhee &amp; Son (Aust) Pty Ltd v Australian Consumer and Competition Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532 ; and Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 at [51] - [58]. These authorities indicate that further relevant matters include: 

 
 (a) the size of the contravening company; 

 
 (b) the degree of power the company has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market; 

 
 (c) whether the conduct was systematic, deliberate, or covert; 

 
 (d) the period over which the conduct occurred; 

 
 (e) the effect on the functioning of the market and other economic effects of the conduct; 

 
 (f) whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level; 

 
 (g) whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and discipline, or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; and 

 
 (h) whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 88">1 As is now well known, Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited and related entities ("Visy") were ordered to pay approximately $36 million in penalties as a result of those entities colluding with Amcor Limited ("Amcor") to fix prices in the cardboard box market: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617 ; (2007) ATPR 42-185 ("the ACCC proceeding" or "penalty proceeding"). This proceeding is one of a number of ancillary proceedings in which allegations of the same or similar conduct are made. It is an action brought by the applicant, Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd ("Cadbury"), against Amcor for damages under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the damages proceedings"). Visy has been joined by Amcor as a respondent to Amcor's cross claim in the damages proceedings.</sentence>
