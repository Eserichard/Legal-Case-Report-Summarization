<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1244">In her reasons for judgment on the appeal from the First Tribunal Decision, Branson J determined the first question adversely to Mr Kaluza but her Honour determined the second question favourably to him. Her Honour set aside the First Tribunal Decision and remitted the matter to the Veterans' Appeal Division of the Tribunal to be determined according to law: Kaluza v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1365. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 498">Ms Eastman submitted that in Repatriation Commission v Nation [1995] FCA 1277 ; (1995) 57 FCR 25 , the remittal was that the matter be remitted to the Tribunal to be heard and determined according to law after admitting further evidence as it considered appropriate. She contrasted that with Justice Branson's order in Kaluza v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1365 ; (2008) 171 FCR 168 which was not an order that the whole matter be remitted. She submitted from Nation , that where an order is ambiguous, it may be permissible to resort to extrinsic material, including the reasons for judgment to resolve the ambiguity... That did not apply to Justice Branson's order, Ms Eastman submitted. </sentence>
