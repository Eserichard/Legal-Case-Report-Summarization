<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 937">As Gray J explained in Pitt v OneSteel Reinforcing Pty Limited , [48] the words have come to have other meanings when used in the law. " [49] In JF Keir Pty Limited v Sparks , [50] Graham J put it a little differently saying that " An action can be stayed as vexatious 'if it can really lead to no possible good'.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 780">Counsel formulated his submissions by reference to principles that are enunciated in Re Filsell and Comcare [2009] AATA 90 ; (2009) 109 ALD 198. I there said, at [33], that applications for dismissal under s 42B should be approached according to the following principles: 
 
 "(a) The word "frivolous" in combination with "vexatious" is a technical legal term, which means that there is no legal basis for the proceedings; it does not necessarily connote that an applicant has acted frivolously in bringing proceedings: Pitt v OneSteel Reinforcing Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 923 at [9] . 
 (b) The expression "vexatious" can include proceedings brought with the intention of annoying or embarrassing or harassing the other party, or for some collateral purpose other than having the court or tribunal adjudicate on the issues raised by the proceedings, or, irrespective of the motive of the litigant, if the proceedings are "so obviously untenable or manifestly groundless as to be utterly hopeless": Attorney-General v Wentworth ( 1988) 14 NSWLR 481 at 491 per Roden J, or if the proceedings have "no reasonable prospect at all of success": Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 at [24] ; [2006] FCA 1829 at [24] , per Madgwick J. 
 (c) The power of the tribunal to dismiss proceedings under s 42B is a power that should be used cautiously.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 720">It is irrelevant in this context. [119] Section 42B provides that the Tribunal may dismiss the application if it is satisfied that the application is frivolous or vexatious. As Gray J explained in Pitt v OneSteel Reinforcing Pty Limited [2008] FCA 923 , " the word 'frivolous', especially when coupled with 'vexatious', is a technical legal term, in substance meaning the absence of a cause of action. " (at [9]). Graham J explained in JF Keir Pty Limited v Sparks [2008] FCA 611 that " An action can be stayed as vexatious 'if it can really lead to no possible good'.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] AATA 447">If it did not, it could dismiss the application for want of jurisdiction and no reference would need to be made to s 42B dismiss an application. 107.

" [156] Graham J said in JF Keir Pty Limited v Sparks , [157] " An action can be stayed as vexatious 'if it can really lead to no possible good'.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] AATA 90">Comcare contends that the present proceedings should be dismissed under s 42B of the AAT Act, on the grounds that the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious. I think that applications for dismissal under s 42B should be approached according to the following principles. 
(a) The word "frivolous" in combination with "vexatious" is a technical legal term, which means that there is no legal basis for the proceedings; it does not necessarily connote that an applicant has acted frivolously in bringing proceedings: Pitt v OneSteel Reinforcing Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 923 at [9] .

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 1340">A factor that may warrant a departure from the usual rule that costs will follow the event is in cases where there is a significant public interest element (Federal Discrimination Law (HREOC page 387)). In Tom Ferguson v Virgin Blue Airlines Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 864 Bennett J set the maximum costs that could be awarded against the unsuccessful applicant in that human rights matter. In Pitt v One Steel Reinforcing Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 923 Justice Gray ordered the unsuccessful applicant to pay the respondent's costs in that human rights matter. In Rana v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 907 Lander J awarded costs against the unsuccessful applicant in that human rights matter that was found to be an abuse of process, and the applicant had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding. In Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 Justice Collier held that a human rights and/or discrimination case will not automatically be regarded as a proceeding in the public interest.</sentence>
