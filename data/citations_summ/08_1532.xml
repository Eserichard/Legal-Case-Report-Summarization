<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 198">To the extent that the Commissioner's submission takes these remarks made by His Honour in one context (characterisation of an amount) and seeks to extend them to another context (derivation) any such extension is inappropriate. For an amount to be assessable as income it must be income derived. The decision in Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [23] concerned payment for services yet to be rendered;
 
(c) a payment made in substitution for another payment entitlement takes the character of the original entitlement; [24] 
 
(d) the money value of a non-cash receipt is the relevant taxable amount; [25] 
 
(e) an amount can be derived as income even if not paid to or received by the taxpayer. Common law concepts of constructive receipt and the statutory formulations of those concepts have a role to play in such cases. [26] 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 636">Unfortunately for Ms Spark, the payment of FTB is specifically linked to taxable income. As indicated earlier the lump sum representing arrears of compensation is clearly taxable income in the year of receipt. However, one issue does arise for consideration. Ms Spark incurred expenditure of $6,484 in legal fees relating to the proceedings she instituted to obtain reinstatement of the weekly compensation entitlement. In the case of Romanin v Commissioner of Taxation (2008) FCA 1532 (16 October 2008) legal expenses incurred in successfully pursuing the payment of remuneration in lieu of notice were held to be deductible under s 8-1(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 . On the same basis it would appear that Ms Spark was entitled to deduct her legal costs against the compensation income received in consequence of the legal action. </sentence>
