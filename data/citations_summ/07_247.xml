<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 79">As Lucev FM pointed out in Rentuza at [26] --- [28] and Hughes at [19] --- [21]: For the purposes of s.570(2)(b) two criteria must be fulfilled. They are: a. that a party must have engaged in an unreasonable act or omission; and b. that the unreasonable act or omission must have caused another party to incur costs in connection with the proceeding (Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Clarke (2008) 170 FCR 574 ; 176 IR 245 at [28] per Tamberlin, Gyles and Gilmour JJ ( Clarke ). Whether a party has engaged in an unreasonable act or omission depends upon an objective analysis of the particular circumstances of the case (Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 879 ; (2007) 162 FCR 392 ; 165 IR 464 at [32] per Tracey J ( Qantas (No 3) ); McAleer v University of Western Australia ( No 2 ) [2007] FCA 247 ; (2007) 161 IR 151. The exercise of the discretion in s 570(2)(b) is not necessarily engaged because: a) a party does not conduct litigation efficiently (Clarke at [29] per Tamberlin, Gyles and Gilmour JJ); b) a concession is made late (Clarke at [29] per Tamberlin, Gyles and Gilmour JJ); c) a party may have acted in a different or timelier fashion (Clarke at [30] per Tamberlin, Gyles and Gilmour JJ); d) a party has adopted a genuine but misguided approach (See, for example, the approach in Qantas (No 3) at [39] per Tracey J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 500">The exception applies when two criteria are satisfied. The first criterion is that one party must have engaged in "an unreasonable act or omission". As the reasoning of Tracey J in Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 879 ; [2007] FCA 879 ; (2007) 162 FCR 392 and Siopis J in McAleer v University of Western Australia (No 2) [2007] FCA 247 ; (2007) 161 IR 151 demonstrates, whether a party has conducted itself or its litigation in such a way as to cross this threshold will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. The second criterion is that the act or omission of one party must have "caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding". Once both criteria are satisfied, then the Court "may" in its discretion order the party which has engaged in the unreasonable act or omission to pay some or all of the costs of the other party.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCAFC 143">28 We turn now to s 824(2) of the WR Act . This provision carves out another exception to the usual rule in s 824(1) that costs orders are not to be made in respect of proceedings in a matter arising under the WR Act . The exception applies when two criteria are satisfied. The first criterion is that one party must have engaged in "an unreasonable act or omission". As the reasoning of Tracey J in Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 879 ; (2007) 162 FCR 392 and Siopis J in McAleer v The University of Western Australia (No 2) [2007] FCA 247 ; (2007) 161 IR 151 demonstrates, whether a party has conducted itself or its litigation in such a way as to cross this threshold will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. The second criterion is that the act or omission of one party must have "caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding". Once both criteria are satisfied, then the Court "may" in its discretion order the party which has engaged in the unreasonable act or omission to pay some or all of the costs of the other party.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 336">Section 824(2) of the WR Act was also considered in McAleer v University of Western Australia (No.2) [2007] FCA 247 ; [2007] 161 IR 151. In that case Siopsis J considered an application for costs on amongst other grounds an unreasonable act by the respondent resulting in the applicant incurring costs with the proceedings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCAFC 145">14 The fact that the CFMEU may have been unsuccessful in its application does not, of course, necessarily lead to the conclusion that the continuation of the proceedings was unreasonable: see McAleer v The University of Western Australia (No 2) [2007] FCA 247 wherein Siopis J found that the absence of power in the Court to grant relief did not result in the finding that a counter claim by the respondent university constituted an "unreasonable act" for the purpose of s 824. His Honour observed that the counter claim raised "a blend of public and private law issues". In these proceedings the amendments to the WRA 1996 created significant changes to the conduct of litigation in industrial matters and the Court's determination affected not only the immediate interests between the parties, but had a wider application for other litigation of an industrial nature. </sentence>
