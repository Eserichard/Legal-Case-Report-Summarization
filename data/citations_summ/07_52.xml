<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 205">Mr Carroll has, in the Court's view, investigated the allegations. Fair Workplace Policy
 In relation to the conduct of the investigation the Fair Workplace Policy does not require: the investigation be carried out by: a particular kind of person; a person with particular qualifications; or a combination of the foregoing; a particular procedure be followed; or particular written documentation to be provided. [73] The Fair Workplace Policy deals with procedural fairness not only in a general way in relation to which the matter has been handled, but sets out certain principles which must be applied. These are dealt with below. The first principle is that the decision-maker must act without bias or prejudging the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] VSC 493">36 Ground of appeal 5(b) alleges that the Tribunal erred, in its application of s 30(1)(b) of the FOI Act, by failing to have regard to a relevant consideration, namely, the fact that the respondent's policy of keeping complaints confidential, from those against whom they are made, was contrary to law. The plaintiff submits that the policy of the Tribunal was contrary to law, because it constituted a breach of the Enterprise Agreement entered into between the university and its staff members. The plaintiff, in his submissions to the Tribunal, and before me, referred to the decision of the Federal Court in McAleer v The University of Western Australia [4] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1512">74 The conclusions in Pangallo are also relevant to the question of remedies for breach of the agreement. As the applicant submitted Pangallo concerned the jurisdiction of State courts. The applicant said that, in light of s 840 of the Workplace Relations Act and the decisions in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (2000) 203 CLR 645 ; [2001] HCA 16 and McAleer v University of Western Australia (2007) 159 IR 96 ; [2007] FCA 52 , it was evident that the Federal Court could grant all remedies necessary to quell the controversy between the parties and was not limited to the remedies specified in Pt 14 of the Act.  79 Thirdly, McAleer (2007) 159 IR 96 ; [2007] FCA 52 is also of no real assistance on this issue. Siopis J was careful to observe that both parties had conducted the trial on the basis of an apparent assumption that the certified agreement in that case was enforceable as a matter of general law. His Honour did not endorse that view but decided the case on the basis of the common position adopted by the parties. Siopis J also observed, at [54], that the declaration sought should not be made because:
 In granting relief under the Act in respect of breaches of a certified agreement, the Court is confined to granting the remedies provided for under the Act. The declaration sought by the University goes beyond a declaration of breach as an incident to imposing a penalty under the Act. The Act does not provide the Court with the power to make declarations of nullity or to set aside actions carried out in breach of a certified agreement. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1490">34 On 11 April 2008, Professor McAleer commenced this proceeding. By way of a further amended application, Professor McAleer claims the following relief:
 
 
 1. A declaration that: 
 
 
 
 
 1.1 upon the proper interpretation of the judgment, declarations and orders made by Siopis J in McAleer v The University of Western Australia [2007] FCA 52 ; (2007) 159 IR 96 clause 6.6 of Schedule D of The University of Western Australia Academic Staff Agreement 2006 requires the allegations the subject of the disciplinary proceedings commenced by the respondent against the applicant on 6 January 2006 under Schedule D of The University of Western Australia Academic Staff Agreement 2004 to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Schedule D of The University of Western Australia Academic Staff Agreement 2004; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1.2 upon a proper interpretation of Clause 6.6.1 of Schedule D of The University of Western Australia Academic Staff Agreement 2006 the allegations set out below against the applicant, contained in the letter from the respondent to the applicant's solicitors dated 4 December 2007, do not constitute matters the subject of disciplinary proceedings under The University of Western Australia Staff Agreement 2006. Those allegations are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 1. in relation to Dr Voola paragraphs 1.1.1(b) to (q) at pages 3 to 12 inclusive; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. in relation to Dr Leong paragraphs 1.1.2(b) to (i) at pages 12 to 16 inclusive;
 
 3. in relation to Dr Le paragraphs 1.1.3(b) to (e) at pages 16 and 17;
 
 4. of authorship and academic fraud at paragraph 1.2(d) at pages 22 and 23 inclusive;
 
 5. of accessing inappropriate material on the university computer network at paragraph 1.3(b) at page 23. 
 
 
 
 
 2. 8 On 2 February 2007, I delivered judgment ( McAleer v The University of Western Australia [2007] FCA 52 ; (2007) 159 IR 96 ( McAleer (No 1) ). I rejected the contention of the University. I made orders to the following effect:
