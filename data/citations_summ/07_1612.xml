<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 90">28 Justice Tracey did not err in the way he had regard to the appellant's failure to give evidence. Justice Tracey, at [22] of his Honour's reasons for judgment in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 8) [2007] FCA 1612 , said:
 22 ... No adverse inference can be drawn merely because Mr Siminton has chosen not to give or call evidence in defence of the charge. The failure is nonetheless of potential significance. This is because, as the High Court explained in RPS v R [2000] HCA 3 ; (2000) 199 CLR 620 at 632-3: 
 
 
 "... it will seldom, if ever, be reasonable to conclude that an accused in a criminal trial would be expected to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1815">1 On 7 November 2007 I found that Mr Siminton had committed contempt of Court by failing to pay a fine imposed on him by a Full Court within the time stipulated by the Full Court (which included an additional two weeks allowed by the District Registrar under the Full Court's Order): see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 8) [2007] FCA 1612. These reasons should be read in conjunction with those in Siminton (No 8). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1714">9 The Full Court's order read:
 
 "2 Paragraph 2 of the orders of Merkel J made on 10 April 2006 is set aside and in lieu thereof it is ordered: 
 
 
 
 (a) A fine in the sum of $50,000 be imposed on the appellant in respect of the contempt ... 
 (b) The fine be paid to the District Registrar within 60 days or such further time and by such instalments as the District Registrar may allow. 
 (c) In the event that there is default in payment of the fine or of any instalment, the District Registrar shall apply to a judge of the Court for direction concerning enforcement. " 
 

On 18 September 2006, the day on which the sixty day period prescribed by Order 2(b) expired, Mr Siminton applied for an extension of time within which to make payment of the $50,000. By order dated 18 September 2006 the District Registrar extended the time for payment to 5:00 pm on 2 October 2006. On that day Mr Siminton's solicitors wrote to the District Registrar seeking a further extension of one month for Mr Siminton to pay the fine. No reason for seeking the extension was given. The application was refused. The fine has not since been paid. On 7 November 2007 I found that Mr Siminton had committed a contempt of the Full Court's order by failing to make the $50,000 payment (or that part of it which he had the capacity to pay) in a timely manner: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 8) [2007] FCA 1612. </sentence>
