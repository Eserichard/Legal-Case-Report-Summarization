<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 1027">The meaning of the term "unemployed" in this context has also been considered in a number of Federal Court and Tribunal decisions. The most relevant recent Federal Court decision in which the meaning of the term "unemployed" in this context has been considered is Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Joss [2006] FCA 884 ; (2006) 152 FCR 541. In Re Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and Skarzynski [2008] AATA 1104 , Deputy President Jarvis conveniently summarised the effect of Graham J's decision in Joss as follows: 
 
 "36 ... His Honour reviewed a number of earlier decisions of the Federal Court and of this tribunal. The following principles that have relevance to the issues arising in the present proceedings are stated in effect in, or may be deduced from, Graham J's judgment or the authorities to which he referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 776">The term "unemployed" is not otherwise defined in the legislation. The Secretary's submissions drew attention to the discussion of the term by Graham J in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Joss [2] where his Honour said: 
 " [12] In the Macquarie Dictionary (A Delbridge et al (eds), Revised 3rd Ed, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, Macquarie University, 2003, p 619) 'unemployed' is defined as:
 1. out of work, especially temporarily and involuntarily; without work or employment. 2. not employed; not in use; not kept busy or at work. 3. not in productive or profitable use.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 720">" [146] 
 
(4) " It may well be that viewed as a question of fact and degree and having regard to the intensity with which a person applies him or herself to a particular enterprise, one may conclude that a person is not self-employed at all. But, once it be found that the person is self-employed it seems to me impossible to conclude that such a person was, at the same time, unemployed. " [147] 
 
 
  Other situations which must be considered are those of the self-employed whether they be engaged in endeavours on their own account or as members of a partnership or of a joint venture. One might say that if a person is carrying on business or engaged in work with a view of profit, that person could not be considered to be unemployed. " [146] 
 
(4) " It may well be that viewed as a question of fact and degree and having regard to the intensity with which a person applies him or herself to a particular enterprise, one may conclude that a person is not self-employed at all. But, once it be found that the person is self-employed it seems to me impossible to conclude that such a person was, at the same time, unemployed. " [147] 
 
 
  124. In Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Joss , [143] Justice Graham considered the meaning of " unemployed " as it is used in s 593(1). The following principles can be drawn from his Honour's judgment and those on which he relied:
 
(1) " ... [T] he word 'unemployed' bears its colloquial or popular meaning of not being engaged in work of a [potentially] remunerative nature. This meaning must ... be modified to allow for those special cases where a person is not engaged in work of a remunerative nature but whose commitment to some activity ... demonstrates a preference for that activity rather than employment ... "; [144] 
 
(2) " The question whether the appellant was 'unemployed' during the whole or part of the period was essentially a question of fact and degree to be decided having regard to the above principles. In Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Joss , [143] Justice Graham considered the meaning of " unemployed " as it is used in s 593(1). The following principles can be drawn from his Honour's judgment and those on which he relied:
 
(1) " ... [T] he word 'unemployed' bears its colloquial or popular meaning of not being engaged in work of a [potentially] remunerative nature. This meaning must ... be modified to allow for those special cases where a person is not engaged in work of a remunerative nature but whose commitment to some activity ... demonstrates a preference for that activity rather than employment ... "; [144] 
 
(2) " The question whether the appellant was 'unemployed' during the whole or part of the period was essentially a question of fact and degree to be decided having regard to the above principles. " [145] 
 
(3) " In addressing the question of whether or not a person is 'unemployed' for the purpose of s 593 of the Act it is not sufficient to confine one's consideration to the question of whether or not a contract of employment existed between the person claiming to be unemployed and a third party. Other situations which must be considered are those of the self-employed whether they be engaged in endeavours on their own account or as members of a partnership or of a joint venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] AATA 587">It seems to me that during this particular period, the Applicant was not unemployed, but was under-employed. In Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Joss (2006) FCA 884 , it was held that a person will be unemployed within the meaning of subsection 593(1) of the SSA if the person is without work or employment and that situation is both temporary and involuntary. If a person is carrying on a business or is engaged in work with a view to a profit, such a person cannot be considered to be unemployed for the purposes of subsection 593(1). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1134">The Tribunal set out the legal principles relevant to a determination of whether the applicant was "unemployed" within the meaning of that term in s 593(1) of the Act. He referred to the decision of Graham J in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Joss [2006] FCA 884 ; (2006) 152 FCR 541. One of the principles the Tribunal formulated was that the question of whether a person is unemployed is a question of fact and degree, and regard should be had to the intensity with which the person applies himself or herself to particular work or a particular enterprise. There is no doubt that the question of whether a person is unemployed is essentially one of fact and degree to be decided having regard to the relevant principles: McAuliffe v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1992] FCA 483 ; (1992) 28 ALD 609. It was not suggested on the appeal that the Tribunal had applied the wrong legal test. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] AATA 1104">In Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Joss [2006] FCA 884 ; (2006) 152 FCR 541 , Graham J considered the meaning of "unemployed" for the purposes of s 593(1) of the SS Act. His Honour reviewed a number of earlier decisions of the Federal Court and of this tribunal. The following principles that have relevance to the issues arising in the present proceedings are stated in effect in, or may be deduced from, Graham J's judgment or the authorities to which he referred. 
(a) The word "unemployed" bears its colloquial or popular meaning of not being engaged in work of a remunerative nature. (b) This meaning must, however, be modified to some extent in that the income test provisions of the SS Act recognise that some income may be earned by a person in receipt of newstart allowance resulting in the diminution of the allowance, but not rendering the person ineligible for it. (c) Work of a remunerative nature encompasses not only the normal employer-employee relationship but also a person who is self-employed. (d) A person may be employed even though his activities do not produce an income or profit. (e) The question of whether a person is unemployed is a question of fact and degree, and regard should be had to the intensity with which the person applies himself or herself to particular work or a particular enterprise.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] AATA 1856">The above statements from the cases of McKenna and McAuliffe were endorsed by the Federal Court in the recent case of Secretary Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Joss [2006] FCA 884 ; (2006) 92 ALD 60. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] AATA 1447">Additionally it is my view that Ms De Gregorio was, in the relevant periods, not unemployed as that expression is used in s 593(1)(a)(i) and thus not capable of satisfying that requirement for qualification for Newstart allowance. The intensity with which she applied herself to employment in her own business, commendable as that may be, means that it is impossible to regard her as being unemployed during that period. In that regard I refer to the discussion by Graham J of the dichotomy between self-employment and unemployment in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Joss [1] where his Honour said: 
"It may well be that viewed as a question of fact and degree and having regard to the intensity with which a person applies him or herself to a particular enterprise, one may conclude that a person is not self-employed at all. But, once it be found that the person is self-employed it seems to me impossible to conclude that such a person was, at the same time, unemployed. "
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] ACTAAT 3">23. In Secretary, Department of Employment &amp; Workplace Relations v Joss [2006] FCA 884 , the respondent Mr Joss had been refused the NSA because the Department of Social Security considered that he was not unemployed (by virtue of his engaging in certain activities for which he received expenses) and therefore was not entitled to the allowance. Following a comprehensive review of relevant decisions of the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the legislative provisions governing the NSA, Graham J held that: 
 A person will be `unemployed' within the meaning of s 593(1) of the [Social Security] Act if that person is without work or employment and that situation is both temporary and involuntary. If a person is carrying on a business or engaged in work with a view to profit, such a person could not be considered to be unemployed for the purposes of s 593(1 ). </sentence>
