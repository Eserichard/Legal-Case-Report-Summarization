<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 498">UWA attempted, on day 44 of the trial, by an amendment to its reply to Dr Gray's defence, to plead an implied term in his contract of employment with it. The implied term was that he owed to UWA a duty of good faith and fidelity. That term had not been previously pleaded. It was raised in answer to defence pleaded by Dr Gray under the Limitation Act 1935 (WA). The amendment was disallowed on 19 June 2007: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 17) [2007] FCA 924 at [42] , ruling A7.
