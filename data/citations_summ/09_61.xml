<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] WASC 131">3 These principles arise from a number of decisions including Rohanna Pty Ltd v Horwath Perth (a firm) [2003] WASC 172 and Waller v Waller [2008] WASC 51. The defendant accepted that the application required these matters be considered in determining the application. However, the defendant added two additional factors which it was submitted are relevant to whether or not an order is made. First, the court must be satisfied that it is appropriate to exercise its discretion to make the order for preliminary discovery. Reference was made to Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 61 and Hancock Family Memorial Foundation Ltd v Fieldhouse (No 2) [2008] WASC 147 [47]. </sentence>
