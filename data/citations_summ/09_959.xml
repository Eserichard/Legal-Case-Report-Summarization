<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 962">Earlier today I urgently granted the applicant leave to appeal from two decisions of a Federal Magistrate in respect of related proceedings. In those decisions his Honour had refused applications, supported by both parties, to adjourn the trial of the substantive proceedings in both cases. The background to the applications before me is set out in detail in Lennox v Amcor Limited trading as Amcor Cartonboard [2009] FCA 959.  Notwithstanding these observations however, in these proceedings I consider that his Honour erred in exercising his discretion to dismiss the applications for adjournment of the trial. I form this view because: I consider there was a denial of natural justice to both the applicant and the respondent when his Honour dismissed the applications without hearing submissions from the parties. Further, in dismissing the applications for adjournment without hearing the parties, the parties were not accorded the opportunity to present their case including as to the prejudice they would both suffer at trial should the adjournment not be allowed. Although his Honour stated in his reasons for decision that he had read Mr Green's affidavits, it was also clear that both parties favoured the adjournment because of the previous settlement negotiations between them and the resultant lack of compliance with his Honour's previous directions. Accordingly, it appeared that there was no prejudice to the respondent from the applicant's application for the adjournment, and indeed there was a proper basis for consideration of the application for adjournment before his Honour, which it appears his did not take into consideration. In refusing the application for an adjournment, it appears that his Honour did not take into consideration the attempts by both parties to communicate with his chambers in the days leading up to the 24 August 2009. In relation to whether, in light of the decision of the High Court in Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27 to refuse the application to adjourn the trial, I repeat my comments in Lennox v Amcor Limited trading as Amcor Cartonboard [2009] FCA 959 as to the relevance of that decision in these circumstances. As I indicated in the judgment allowing leave to appeal, I consider that the facts in Aon are very different from the circumstances of this case and did not justify a refusal to adjourn the trial in the circumstances of this case. </sentence>
