<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] NNTTA 162">This decision was recently endorsed by Nicholson J in Koara People v State of Western Australia (2006) FCA 66 (9 February 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 734">51 In my view, there is little to add to the observations of his Honour in Hicks . Similar observations have been made in many other Federal Court cases including La Macchia v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1992) 110 ALR 201 at 204 (per Burchett J), Bank of Western Australia v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 55 FCR 233 at 255 (per Lindgren J), Nezovic v MIMIA [2003] FCA 1263 ; (2003) 133 FCR 190 at 206 (per French J), and Koara People v State of Western Australia [2006] FCA 66 at par 29 (per Nicholson J). The principle of comity is applied in other Australian courts in respect of decisions of single judges: I note, by way of illustration, Durovic trading as Shell Tornik Roadhouse v Judge , unreported Supreme Court of New South Wales, Rolfe J, 25 February 1997; Zotovic v Dobel Boat Hire Pty Ltd (1985) 62 ACTR 29 at 32 (per Blackburn CJ); Anteden Pty Ltd v Glen Eira City Council [2000] VSC 366 par 25 (per Balmford J); McDermott Projects Pty Ltd v Chadwell Pty Ltd [2001] QSC 322 ; (2002) 2 QdR 363 at 365 (per Holmes J); and Swetnam Brothers Pty Ltd v Grundy , unreported Supreme Court of Tasmania, Wright J, 14 March 1997. The principle of judicial comity as between Courts of equal status is long-standing in the United Kingdom; the principle is discussed, with many case citations, in Halsbury's Law of England , 4 th Edition Reissue vol 37 at par 1244. I also note similar comments in A MacAdam and J Pyke, Judicial Reasoning and the Doctrine of Precedent in Australia (Butterworths, Sydney, 1998) at 179-180.</sentence>
