 Preamble 
 This publication is a draft for public comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 854">The Applicant referred at some length to the judgment of Her Honour Stone J in TT-Line Company Pty Limited v FC of T [2009] FCA 658 ; (2009) 72 ATR 982 ; [2009] ATC 20-110. That judgment is, so I was informed, on appeal but in respect of an issue which does not bear on the decision in this matter. In that case, Mr Egan booked a return crossing of Bass Strait on the Spirit of Tasmania. His booking was for two adults and included a motor vehicle. It was common cause that Mr Egan was an eligible passenger and that the taxpayer was a Service Operator under the Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme. Mr Egan paid an amount, which was rebated, and in accordance with the Scheme, the taxpayer became entitled to reimbursement of the rebate by the Commonwealth Government. Stone J held that the reimbursement amount constituted consideration for a supply and thus attracted GST. The fact that in respect of the supply, the supplier received consideration otherwise than from the actual recipient of that supply does not have the effect that the third party consideration is not also consideration for the supply. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1209">Finally, the respondent contended that the analysis of Stone J in TT-Line Company Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 658 compelled the conclusion that the DOT was not entitled to claim the GST component of the payment to the taxi-cab operator as an input tax credit. I reject that contention. The principal issue in that case concerned "consideration" and, in particular, whether the payment in issue fell within one of the stated exceptions in s 9-15(3)(c) of the GST Act. The question was a different question involving a different taxpayer and different arrangements. </sentence>
