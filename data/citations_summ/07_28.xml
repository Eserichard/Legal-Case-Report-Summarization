<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 132">82 Finally, even if the question was whether Mr Sales had 'permission to enter or remain in Australia' in the relevant sense, the answer would be in the negative. No such permission was required ( Manatiy v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 28 at [2] ). The absence of any relevant prohibition does not amount to an act that could be described as 'permission'. Even if an Australian official were present on arrival and allowed, in the sense of not impeding, the entry of the family into Australia, this could not be described as the grant of 'permission to enter Australia' as required. </sentence>

The Tribunal does have discretionary powers to investigate pursuant to s.424 and s. 427 (1)(d) of the Act , but there is no duty to so investigate (see SZGQN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 28 at [28] ). </sentence>
