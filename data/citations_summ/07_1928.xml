<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 185">The result was that the production of the documents there sought, was stayed until further order. A similar order resulted in Sunland Waterfront (BVI) Ltd v Prudentia Investments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1197 , where jurisdiction also was in issue, as well as an application for stay of the proceedings. It was accepted by Logan J that a notice to produce could be issued in relation to interlocutory proceedings, but it was observed at [10]: 
 
"There is, it must be said, something of an incongruity in respect of a party who, on the one hand, challenges the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the substantive proceeding and, on the other hand, seeks to invoke its compulsory process to support an application that that party is making. It may well be that, again prima facie, that course is impermissible: see Armacel Pty Ltd v Smurfit Stone Container Corporation [2007] FCA 1928 ; (2007) 164 FCR 123 at [10] . " 
 
  The Federal Court has taken a different approach in Armacel Pty Ltd v Smurfit Stone Container Corporation [2007] FCA 1928 ; (2007) 164 FCR 123 , where the Court's jurisdiction was also in contest. There, although Jacobsen J referred to the approach taken by Giles CJ Comm D in News Corporation Ltd v Lenfest Communications Inc , observing that 'the principle stated by his Honour is one that I ought to follow (at [9]), he concluded that: 
 
"10 The effect of so doing is that I do not consider that at this stage of the proceedings in which the jurisdiction is under challenge, the applicant can invoke the compulsory processes of the Court. The rules of the Federal Court provide that a notice to produce has the force and effect of a subpoena. Accordingly, the issue of a notice to produce must be considered as an attempt to invoke the Court's compulsory processes in the way discussed by Giles J in the News. 11 Mr Wood, who appears for the applicant, submitted that the decision of Giles J is distinguishable. He drew attention to what appears at 259 to 260 where his Honour observed that he did not think that Pt 36 rule 16 of the Supreme Court Rules should be read down and that it empowers the service of a notice to produce on a foreign party. However, I do not consider those observations of Giles J bear upon the issue before me this morning. "
