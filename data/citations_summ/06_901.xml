<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1692">111 As already stated, absent authority on the point, the natural meaning of the expression "competent administrative authority" is a body with legal capacity to manage, deal with, or suitably address an employee's allegation against his or her employer, in some way. In Leicester v Western Desert Puntukurnuparna Aboriginal Corporation (unreported, IRCA 16/97, 10 February 1997) Ritter JR reached much the same conclusion: see also Weier v Modern Alarms [2007] AIRC 432 at [59] per Senior Deputy President Richards. Thus, the Occupational Health and Safety Officer at the Victorian Trades Hall Council had no relevant competence to deal with the email communication made by Ms Zhang and was not a "competent administrative authority": see Zhang at 350; see also Crowley v Parker Hannifin (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 901 ; (2006) 154 IR 88 at 92 per Marshall J.</sentence>
