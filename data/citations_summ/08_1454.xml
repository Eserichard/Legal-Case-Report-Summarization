<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 16">As a unitholder in the Wholesale Fund, the applicant "is entitled to enforce the trustee's obligation to administer the trust according to its terms": Kafataris v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1454 ; (2008) 172 FCR 242 at [42] per Lindgren J. As such the applicant is a beneficiary of the Wholesale Fund and the relevant beneficiary for the purposes of s 97. As Lindgren J added at [43]: 
 
 The word "beneficiary" reaches beyond a person who has a beneficial interest in the trust property. It is possible for the legal estate in land to be vested in "trustees" without equitable ownership being vested in someone else. The trustees must, however, owe fiduciary obligations in respect of the trust property to persons who, although they may have no interest in the trust property and may never have an interest in the trust property, are called "beneficiaries". In CPT Custodian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue of the State of Victoria [2005] HCA 53 ; (2005) 224 CLR 98 , the High Court rejected (at [25]): 
 
 
 
 
 a "dogma" that, where ownership is vested in a trustee, equitable ownership must necessarily be vested in someone else because it is an essential attribute of a trust that it confers upon individuals a complex of beneficial legal relations which may be called ownership. 
 
 
 
 
 That is to say, there can be a trustee who owes fiduciary obligations in respect of trust property to "beneficiaries" without any of the latter having a beneficial interest in the property.
