<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1585">There was at one stage a debate as to whether the subsequent decision of the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 in which Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ had said (at 154) that case management was "not an end in itself" was in reality inconsistent with what had been held in Sali . For example, in Inamed Development Co v Morton Surgical Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1359 ; (2007) 73 IPR 308 Gyles J expressed the view (at 30[7]) that the effect of JL Holdings had "been exaggerated". However, Aon resolves that debate decisively in favour of the Sali position: [2009] HCA 27 ; 258 ALR 14 at 46 [11] . </sentence>
