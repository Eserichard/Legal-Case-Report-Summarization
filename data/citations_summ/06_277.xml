<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] VSCA 162">Their Honours were referring to the legislation in New South Wales, which is somewhat wider than the Victorian. This does not affect the applicability in Victoria of their Honours' general observations. Riddle v Riddle has been followed in the Federal Court of Australia, [67] Victoria [68] and the other States [69] and I will apply it in the present case. 
 
 Expedient in the interests of who or what? 
 155 Section 63(1) specifies expedience to be the criterion for determining whether a power should be conferred on the trustees for the management or administration of trust property.</sentence>
