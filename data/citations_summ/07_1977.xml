<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 948">Mr Dubler in his written submissions in respect to the general principles of the application of s.179 referred the Court to the decision in Boensch v Pascoe [2007] FCA 1977 per Buchannan J at [10]: [10] Examination of this issue sheds light on the quality of the case necessary to order that an inquiry be held under s 179 of the Act. A Full Court said recently that 'a clear case must be made out to warrant an inquiry' (Maxwell-Smith v Donnelly [2006] FCAFC 150 at [53]; see also Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10 at [30] . The necessity to establish some adequate foundation for removal of a trustee has been long established. Mr Dubler contends that the most convenient course to follow would be to decide the initial issue of whether or not there ought to be an inquiry and if so then secondly the scope of the inquiry is determined. Alternatively, if there are insufficient grounds to order such inquiry, the application fails. Mr Dubler referred the Court to the decision in Boench v Pasco [2007] FCA 1977 per Buchanan J at [7] where His Honour refers to the usual or appropriate approach, being the two-stage approach. Mr Dubler informed the Court that the difficulty facing his client is that there is a statement of particulars, but the statements are broad and inadequately particularise. This is supported by ten volumes of lever arch files. In December 2008, the Applicants were requested to identify to some precision, which documents would be relied upon to support the pleaded particulars. The only response received to this request was that this would be made available at the final hearing.  The learned authors from Australian Bankruptcy Law &amp; Practice indicate that it is not necessary to prove conduct on the part of the trustee amounting to fraud or dishonesty, as it is enough to prove conduct such as vexatious obstruction of the realisation of the estate in the interest of the debtor shows that a trustee is no longer fit to remain a trustee: Ex parte Newitt; Re Mansel (1884) 14 QBD 177 (CA). It will "in many cases" be "sufficient reason" for an enquiry and "for the Trustee to be removed", where "the relationship between the Trustee and the bankrupt has totally broken down", especially if "there is...a clear conflict of interest for the Trustee: Doolan v Dare (2004) 2 ABC (NS) 16; [2004] FCA 682 at [49] per Spender J. Nevertheless, "a bankrupt will never be allowed, by an assiduous pattern of resistance of the Trustee to his estate, to generate and then rely upon a suggested reason for removal thereby created. It is clearly an insufficient ground for removal of a trustee that a bankrupt resists the proper administration of his estate and sets out to frustrate the trustee in the proper performance of his duties: Boensch v Pascoe (2007) 5 ABC (NS) 480; [2007[ FCA 1977 per Buchanan J at [92]-[93]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 866">In advancing that submission, reliance is placed by Dr Wenkart upon the following observations of Northrop, Wilcox and Cooper JJ in Adsett v Berlouis (1992) 37 FCR 201 at 212: 
 
 ... the trustee's right to remuneration is limited to work properly undertaken. In this context, "properly" means work reasonably and bona fide undertaken for the purpose of administering the estate or performing any public duty imposed by the Act, conformably with the trustee's duty to perform the work with reasonable care and skill and in an efficient and economical way. 
 

 
" There exists ", it has been said, " a public interest in ensuring that trustee's remuneration is open to objective scrutiny ": McKinnon v Pattison [2009] FCA 1421 at [40] per Marshall J. See also: O'Keeffe v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 389 at [14] , [2005] FCA 389 ; 218 ALR 604 per Nicholson J; Boensch v Pascoe [2007] FCA 1977 at [10] to [15], 5 ABC(NS) 480 at 483 to 484 per Buchanan J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 548">In determining whether s.179(1) of the Bankruptcy Act is to be invoked it is usual to consider first whether an inquiry should be held into the conduct of a trustee in bankruptcy. [5] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 178">In Boensch v Pascoe [2007] FCA 1977 , Buchanan J dealt with an application for an inquiry into the conduct of a trustee. In that case, his Honour determined what must be established to demonstrate a basis for removal and specifically where it was alleged there had been a breakdown in the relationship between trustee and bankrupt. His Honour said:- 
 
 [92] Obviously enough, a bankrupt should not be allowed, by an assiduous pattern of resistance to the trustee of his estate, to generate and then rely upon a suggested reason for removal thereby created.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1127">1 On 13 December 2007 I dismissed an application by Mr Boensch seeking the removal of Mr Pascoe as his trustee ( Boensch v Pascoe [2007] FCA 1977). In a later judgment, on 27 March 2008, I made orders as to costs of those proceedings ( Boensch v Pascoe [2008] FCA 412). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 412">1 In the primary proceedings which I decided on 13 December 2007 ( Boensch v Pascoe (2007) FCA 1977) Mr Boensch sought orders under ss 178 and 179 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) including an order that an inquiry be ordered into the conduct of Mr Pascoe as the trustee of his bankrupt estate. In the earlier judgment I dismissed all his claims. Mr Pascoe now seeks his costs of defending the proceedings on a party/party basis. The award of costs is in the discretion of the Court - see s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The discretion must be exercised judicially but normally costs follow the event. There is no reason why Mr Pascoe should not have an order for his costs in this case. Mr Boensch did not suggest otherwise.</sentence>
