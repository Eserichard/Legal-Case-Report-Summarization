<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VSC 603">2) [2009] FCA 656 ; (2009) 185 IR 414 , [103] (North J); Poniatowska v Hickenbotham [2009] FCA 680 , [321] (Mansfield J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 8">7 Beginning in January 2006, Ms Yousif worked as a mobile lender in the Western Region. Her immediate manager was Mr Cameron McKinnon, Sales Manager Mobile Lending, who reported to Mr Ian Gwynne, Regional Sales Manager, Mobile Banking, Western Region. Mr Gwynne in turn reported to Mr Richard Porter, Regional General Manager, Retail Services and Sales, Western Region; and Mr Porter reported to Mr Grahame Carney, Executive General Manager, Branch and Relationship Banking: Yousif v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (No 2) [2009] FCA 656 at [8] and [10]. Ms Yousif's claims regarding the failure to appoint her to the PRB position focused on the conduct of Mr Porter and Mr Carney.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 722">The question then becomes whether, if confined to this claim, it was unreasonable for Ms Yousif to reject the offer of $80,000. That, in turn, depends upon whether it was reasonable for her to continue to rely on the assumption that her earnings would continue at the rate which she had been earning in the prior period. A fuller picture of her commission earnings is set out at [19] of the primary reasons for judgment: Yousif v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (No 2) [2009] FCA 656. The table there shows that the earnings upon which Ms Yousif relied for her claim were vastly different to those in earlier periods. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 657">Then, on 30 May 2008 she filed proceeding VID 394 of 2008 in this Court. In that proceeding she alleged that the Bank acted in breach of her contract of employment by refusing to allow her to transfer to PRB, and also acted in breach of her contract of employment in the way in which it conducted the investigation into the decision to refuse to allow her to transfer to PRB. A detailed account of that controversy is contained in the reasons for judgment published in application VID 394 of 2008 ( Yousif v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (No 2) [2009] FCA 656) , and, it is not necessary to repeat those details in this judgment. Rather that account should be read as incorporated in these reasons. However, some aspects of particular relevance to this application should be related. </sentence>
