<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1203">There followed unsuccessful applications in this Court [1] , the Federal Court [2] and the High Court [3] to review the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 439">I note also the reference to SZKNX as referred to in SZFMW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1862 at [17] (per Bennett J): "In SZKNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 176 ; (2008) 104 ALD 475 the Full Court of this Court considered the meaning of notification for the purposes of s 477 of the Act. The Full Court concluded that notification occurred when an applicant has physical possession of a decision by any means. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 83">Moreover, even if my conclusion as to the application of the Act's deeming regime is incorrect and it applies in this case, Bennett J held in SZFMW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1862 that the ratio of SZKNX applies nevertheless. This has the consequence that when considering the application of the time limits in s.477, the Court must have regard to the actual date of notification even if the Act deems receipt to have occurred on a different day. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1968">8 As I pointed out in SZFMW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1862 at [12] , the Full Court in Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 242 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10 applied Anshun in the context of judicial review of administrative action and said at [37] that where an issue was so relevant to the subject matter of the earlier action that it would be unreasonable not to have raised it at that time, it is an abuse of process to endeavour to raise that issue for the first time in a subsequent proceeding between the parties. Further, in Metwally v University of Wollongong (1985) 60 ALR 68 , the High Court stated at [7] that: 
 
 Except in the most exceptional circumstances, it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party, after a case had been decided against him, to raise a new argument which, either deliberately or by inadvertence, he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so. </sentence>
