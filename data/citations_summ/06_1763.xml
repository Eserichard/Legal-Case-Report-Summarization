<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 77">23 The submissions of the parties on the question of costs invited analysis of whether the applicant would or might have succeeded in obtaining relief before the order was made by Howie J. In cases which are settled either by consent orders or discontinuance, it is ordinarily inappropriate to determine who would have succeeded in order to deal with the question of costs. There is no reason to depart from that approach in this case where an intervening event (Howie J making the order) relevantly altered the legal foundation of the case originally advanced by the applicant. Similarly, I see no reason to depart from the approach adopted in cases which have settled, by considering whether the parties acted reasonably in both bringing the proceedings and defending them. It was an approach adopted by Heerey J in Servier Laboratories (Australia) Pty Ltd v GenRx Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1763 in which an act of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, after the proceedings had been commenced, effectively destroyed the basis of the applicant's.</sentence>
