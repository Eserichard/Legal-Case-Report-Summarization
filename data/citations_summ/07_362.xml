<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 553">Mr Sivaloganathan submits that the fact that the Tribunal did not give weight to the five documents because of the applicant's lack of credibility does not constitute jurisdictional error: SZGQZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1091 at [26] ; NZXFN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 362. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 452">In MZXFN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 362 her Honour Bennett J considered whether or not medical reports that were put in writing invoked s.424A(1) obligations. Her Honour stated at [11]: [11] Section 424A(1) of the Act in Div 4 has no application, as the documents in question were given to the Tribunal by the appellant for the purposes of the review application (s 424A(3)(b)). Indeed, the appellant does not raise any ground of appeal in this regard. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 2024">It was observed that this was not a case in which the Tribunal had made a finding of fraudulent documentation such as to raise issues as those considered in WACO v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; [2003] FCAFC 171 ; (2003) 131 FCR 511 and WAEJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2003) 76 ALD 597 and see MZXFN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 362. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 1638">51. The Tribunal did not make a positive finding of forgery in respect of any of the Court documents. Ms Mitchelmore, also referred the Court to the decision of Bennett J in MZFXN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 362. In that case the Tribunal had made a finding of adverse credibility on the basis of which it rejected documentary evidence as failing to support the applicant's claims.</sentence>
