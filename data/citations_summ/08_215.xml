<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 166">The decision sought to be attacked by the applicant is a decision of the Tribunal. It is a decision of an administrative character. It was made pursuant to the provisions of s 500(1)(b) of the Act and was thus a decision "... made under the Act ...". For the purposes of the Act, the decision of the Tribunal was clearly a privative clause decision (see s 5(1) and s 474(2) of the Act) or a purported privative clause decision. (See s 5(1) and s 5E of the Act. See also Shuster v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 215 ; (2008) 167 FCR 186 at [5] , [13], [20], [26] and [28]. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1263">7 Division 2 of Part 8 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides for the manner in which decisions may be reviewed by the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court and the High Court. Section 476 provides for the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. Section 476(2)(a) and (d), it has recently been held, are not invalid because they oblige the High Court to exercise exclusively and without remitter the jurisdiction conferred by s 75(v) of the Constitution with respect to certain decisions of the Minister: MZXOT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] HCA 28. Section 476A provides for the limited original jurisdiction to be entertained by this Court: eg, Assad v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1039 ; La Bara v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 785 at [3] ; Shuster v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 215 at [6]---[7] [2008] FCA 215 ; , 167 FCR 186 at 188. The appellate jurisdiction of this Court is relevantly that conferred by s 24(1)(d) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). That appellate jurisdiction may be exercised by a single Judge of this Court: s 25(1AA)(a). </sentence>
