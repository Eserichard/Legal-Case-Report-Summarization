<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1393">In the exercise of the Court's discretion to grant an order under O 15A r 3, the Court must consider whether there is the prospect of the applicant succeeding in the proceedings against the person to be sued: see generally Monsanto Company v Syngeta Seeds Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 228. The claim must be more than a claim worth investigating, it must have some prospect of succeeding: see Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (ACN 008 169 090) v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 980 ; (2009) 82 IPR 121 at [51] - [54] . It is essential that on an application for preliminary discovery that an applicant provide evidence in support of his claim for final relief: see Wyeth v Secretary, Department of Health and Ageing [2009] FCA 313 ; (2009) 255 ALR 352 at [24] - [25]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 542">Dr Lopert gave as an example of how the market entry of a bioequivalent generic product could be delayed, the sponsor of an originator product commencing breach of patent or copyright proceedings. She asserted that this has occurred on the Australian market. She referred to the case of Wyeth v Department of Health and Ageing [2009] FCA 313 ( Wyeth ), where Wyeth had originally sought information about applications to list bioequivalent generic products to venlafaxine in an FoI application. Dr Lopert said Wyeth could have sought injunctions to prevent the registration of generic venlafaxine products on the ARTG and listing on the PBS. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 367">Hooper v Kirella has been regularly followed and applied in preliminary discovery applications in this Court: see, e.g., Allphones Retail Pty Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 980 ; (2009) 259 ALR 354 ; Wyeth v Secretary, Department of Health and Ageing [2009] FCA 313 ; (2009) 255 ALR 352 ; Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1560 ; (2007) 163 FCR 554 (' Optiver '); Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12 ; (2006) 150 FCR 165 ; and Kennedy v Wallace (2004) 208 ALR 424. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 980">In Wyeth v Secretary, Department of Health and Ageing [2009] FCA 313 ; (2009) 255 ALR 352 at [24] ---[29] (pp 355---356) Jacobson J described the test as being "... along the same lines as that which applies to a claim for interlocutory injunctive relief ". His Honour went on to say that consideration of that test was connected to the identification of the interests of justice.  The Full Court's judgment in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; 96 FCR 1 is binding upon me. I think that what is required is more than a claim worth investigating. In my judgment, what is required is a claim that is within the jurisdiction of this Court and which is not so near to being hopeless as would reasonably and properly justify the claim being described as "merely speculative". The foreshadowed claim must have some prospect of succeeding. Success in this context requires a cause of action known to the law and a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect that some remedy might be granted. If the foreshadowed proceedings would almost certainly be susceptible to an order for dismissal pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), then preliminary discovery would ordinarily not be ordered. This is the flavour of the remarks of Jacobson J in Wyeth [2009] FCA 313 ; 255 ALR 352 at [24] ---[29]. </sentence>
