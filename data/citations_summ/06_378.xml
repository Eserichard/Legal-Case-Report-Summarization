After the applicant initially failed to appear, I granted him leave to set aside my earlier decision, dismissing the application, heard it and determined that, similarly to my earlier decision, the application was without substance: SZGGS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 224 and [2006] FCA 378. Heydon J dismissed an application in the High Court for leave to appeal out of time.</sentence>
