<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1899">6 It will be apparent from my earlier judgment ( Phosphate Resources Ltd v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (No. 2) [2008] FCA 1521) that the applicant ("PRL") failed upon the case which it initially brought to trial. PRL put the entirety of its written and oral case in chief upon premises and arguments which I found in the earlier judgment did not provide a legal foundation for its application for relief to be granted. The respondent was required to devote its energies to a comprehensive written and oral response. Had the case gone forward on the basis of pleadings, and had PRL sought and been granted leave to supplement its case at such a late stage in the proceedings as occurred in this case, there seems little doubt that it would only have been permitted to do so in return for some protection of the respondent on the question of costs. The case was not conducted on pleadings. As I explained in the earlier judgment that was the result of a position taken by the respondent.</sentence>
