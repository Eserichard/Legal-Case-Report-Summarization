<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1034">From time to time there has been criticism of the extent to which the Comcare Guide has been or is faithful to the legislative directives in the SRC Act governing its preparation and content (see e.g. Comcare v Ticsay [1992] FCA 468 ; (1992) 38 FCR 181 ; Comcare v Kay (1997) 26 AAR 124 ; Whittaker v Comcare [1998] FCA 1099 ; (1998) 86 FCR 532 at 544-545 (" Whittaker "); Canute v Comcare [2006] HCA 47 ; (2006) 226 CLR 535 ( "Canute" ); Parker v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2007] FCA 1161 ; and Fellowes v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2009] HCA 38 ; (2009) 240 CLR 28 ( "Fellowes" )). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 251">Counsel for Ms Broadhurst maintained that the insertion of the italicised words into the introduction to Table 9.7 was not authorised since no such limitation was included in the Act. Counsel suggested that where there was any inconsistency between the terms of the Act and the Guide, the terms of the Act take precedence over the subordinate legislative instrument. [7] As counsel contended, ' a subordinate instrument, the Guide, cannot alter or qualify the statutory burden imposed ... by s 24(5) of the SRC Act by introducing into the determination a notion of what would have occurred but for the injury' . [8] As counsel said, if the Guide is inconsistent in the sense that it ' could not reasonably have been adopted as a means of attaining the ends of the power' it is invalid.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1424">21 In aid of this submission, Mr Bryant pointed to observations made by the Full Court in Lees v Comcare [1999] FCA 753 ; (1999) 56 ALD 84 , at [39] to the effect that the powers and discretions conferred on the Tribunal by s 43 of the AAT Act are conferred for the purpose of reviewing the decision under review and are not powers able to be exercised at large. Reference was also made to observation of the Full Court of the High court in Canute v Comcare [2006] HCA 47 ; (2006) 226 CLR 535 , at 542, [14], taken up by Greenwood J in Parker v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2007] FCA 1161 ; (2007) 96 ALD 624 , at [52], to the effect that the Approved Guide fell for application through the "prism" of the injury which the claimant had suffered resulting in permanent impairment. Reliance was also placed upon the proposition, flowing from the rejection of a submission to the contrary by Jenkinson J in Comcare v Amorebieta (1996) 66 FCR 83 , at 96, that s 24(5) of the SRC Act was not to be construed in a way which admitted of an assessment of the degree of permanent impairment proportionate to the causal contribution of the incident giving rise to the compensation claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1351">1 On 7 August 2007, the Court set aside a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') (described as Decision Q2005/572) that the respondent is not liable to pay compensation to the applicant pursuant to s 24 of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) ('the Act') in respect of a permanent impairment resulting from an injury suffered by the applicant. The Court made further consequential orders and reserved the costs of the proceeding for determination after receipt of further submissions ( Parker v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2007] FCA 1161). </sentence>
