<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 733">In addition, in July 2007 Buchanan J set aside an order in the nature of an asset preservation order that had been made on an urgent basis by the Duty Judge on 28 December 2006 on the application of Mr Tadros (who alleged various kinds of wrongdoing by Mr Wakim) restraining Mr and Mrs Wakim from divesting themselves of certain properties, including their home, and disposing of the proceeds of sale. In the meantime, Mr Tadros had commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court to extend a caveat lodged on the Wakims' home that were discontinued by consent. According to Buchanan J (see Tadros v J &amp; R Investment Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1041) the claim that a sale of the property in question was imminent later proved to be incorrect. Buchanan J found that the tests for the imposition of such restraints were not satisfied (and had not been satisfied in the first instance) and vacated the orders. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 832">2 The proceedings were commenced by application and statement of claim filed on 3 October 2006. I indicated in an earlier judgment ( Tadros v J &amp; R Investment Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1041) that the statement of claim was not in a satisfactory form. Directions were made on 9 July 2007 granting the applicant leave to file an amended statement of claim before 27 July 2007. Provision was made for the filing of defences and any necessary reply to a defence. 12 On balance, I am satisfied that despite the default by the remaining respondents, there is a proper foundation for an order for further costs against the applicant. The statement of claim originally filed was not in a satisfactory form. Nevertheless, the applicant obtained asset preservation orders from a duty judge late in December 2006 on the basis of the statement of claim. On 11 July 2007 I set those orders aside ( Tadros v J &amp; R Investment Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1041). The amended statement of claim filed on 31 July 2007 was also not in a satisfactory form. I have no doubt if it had not been dealt with by consent on 12 December 2007 it would have been struck out in whole or in part. The respondents have inevitably borne the burden of responding to the applicant's initiatives. In the circumstances, and not without some hesitation, I am satisfied that the remaining respondents should be protected by some form of further costs order.
