<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 200">In Rivera v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCA 1 Tamberlin J emphasised the words '... may , if it is in the interests of the administration of justice ...'. At [7]-[8] his Honour stated: The issue in the present reasons is whether the discretion of the Court should determine that the "administration of justice" requires Mr Rivera's proceedings to be referred to the Registrar to arrange for pro bono legal representation. In my view, the administration of justice in this case does not require that the matter be referred to a Registrar to arrange pro bono legal representation or advice for Mr Rivera because his application of 28 December 2007 discloses no reasonable prospects of success, and Mr Rivera has not adduced any evidence or provided any authority to indicate otherwise. The lack of reasonable prospects of success, or where a case is "patently hopeless" or has no "arguable basis", has been regarded by the Court as sufficient reason to refuse a referral under O 80 r 4: see Taylor [2005] FCA 319 at [10] ; Rivera v The Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1465 at [34] . As a matter of discretion, therefore, I am of the view that it is not appropriate to prolong the present proceedings which are without merit. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1772">19 That may have been the " impression " of the now Appellant at the time. But there was no obligation imposed upon the Tribunal to raise with him whatever reservations may have been experienced at the time as to the explanations being provided by the now Appellant, let alone any obligation to raise whatever reservations may subsequently have emerged when the evidence in its entirety was being considered and the reasons being drafted. As was recognised by Lord Diplock in F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 at 369:
 ... the rules of natural justice do not require the decision-maker to disclose what he is minded to decide so that the parties may have a further opportunity of criticising his mental processes before he reaches a final decision. If this were a rule of natural justice only the most talkative of judges would satisfy it and trial by jury would have to be abolished. And, after having cited these observations, in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 , 228 CLR 152 at 166 Gleeson CJ, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ further observed:
 [48] ... Procedural fairness does not require the Tribunal to give an applicant a running commentary upon what it thinks about the evidence that is given. On the contrary, to adopt such a course would be likely to run a serious risk of conveying an impression of prejudgment. See also: SZHBP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1299 at [11] , [2008] FCA 1299 ; 103 ALD 595 at 597. Although the phrase " the interests of justice " is " wide " ( Taylor v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 319 at [10] per French J), the " nature and complexity of the proceeding " does not warrant the making of any such referral. And it is not considered that either the application for review as made to the Federal Magistrates Court or to this Court on appeal exposes any argument which has any real prospects of success. An assessment as to prospects of success is relevant to the exercise of the " broad discretion " conferred by O 80 r 4: Rivera v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCA 1 at [6] ---[8] per Tamberlin J. Moreover, the now Appellant had the benefit of legal assistance prior to the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court. Such assistance as may otherwise have been warranted was most appropriately received at the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court rather than on appeal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 63">That does not mean that if legal representation is unavailable the litigation must come to a halt. It may be that, if in the end, no pro bono practitioner is found who is willing to act then the appellant would have to represent himself. 

 A referral has been refused where it has been concluded that proceedings disclose no arguable basis or disclose no reasonable prospects of success: see, eg, Ri v era v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1465 ; Rivera v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCA 1. </sentence>
