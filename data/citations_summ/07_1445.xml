In Pratt Holdings Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 at 366, Finn J said that when applying the dominant purpose test, the obvious starting point is with what was the intended use (or uses) of that document which accounted for it being brought into existence. Finn J said this is a question of fact. A document or communication for which legal professional privilege is claimed may relate to either the giving or obtaining legal advice or provision of legal services. There is no requirement that legal proceedings have commenced. The document or communication may have been created or obtained because litigation is anticipated ( O'Reilly and Others v The Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria and Others [1983] HCA 47 ; (1983) 153 CLR 1 at 22-23) or reasonably contemplated ( Waterford v The Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54)). </sentence>

 [ 17 ] To put the proposition in different terms, if "it is in the other side's power to destroy the privilege entirely,"... it can no longer be said that the original holder can reasonably expect any continued confidentiality. In such circumstances, the existence of the privilege cannot be made to turn on whether the other side in fact places the document into evidence or uses it for examination --- either legal privilege exists or it does not, and either the client controls it or they do not: Telstra Corp Ltd v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No 2) [2007] FCA 1445 at [21] , "If a communication qualifies for legal professional privilege, the privilege is absolute.

 produce a number of information and documents listed on a 10 page 
 attachment. From mid-2006, the respondent raised the claim of client 
 legal privilege in relation to several files and documents, while waiving 
 the privilege in relation to some and producing the others. The 
 Tribunal examined the summonsed documents and agreed with the 
 respondent's claim for legal professional privilege relating to a number 
 of them. In making its decision on the claim of privilege, the Tribunal 
 relied on the decisions of Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for 
 Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No. 2) 
 [2007] FCA 1445 and Rich v Harrington [2007] FCA 1987. Accordingly, 
 the claim for privilege applied to communications which were made for

Further the affidavit fails to disclose any basis for privilege other than 'assertions and generalised comments' [see Telstra v Minister for Communications [2007] FCA 1445 ; Barnes v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 88 at 16 and 18]; the affidavit of Afsana Jallia-Tahery sworn 20 December 2007 does not take the matter any further. The intention of the Rules is that a party should be able to discern clearly whether or not a claim that a document is privileged is justified. That is not possible here. The failure to clearly disclose the basis of the claim for privilege suggests it should be refused: National Crime Authority v S [1991] 29 FCR 203 , 211. ...
 

 
10. The Court could look at the documents. That is an alternative approach : see Campbell v Baker (1983) 152 CLR 52. " (emphasis added)</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] NSWADT 85">31 He relies on the Federal Court of Australia decision in Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No. 2) [2007] FCA 1445 (" Telstra ") where Graham J observed at paragraph [12]: 
 
 
 "12 No evidence whatsoever has been led by Telstra to establish the role which the various legal practitioners performed within Telstra. In particular, no evidence has been advanced to disclose the measure of independence of the legal practitioners in question and their ability to provide impartial legal advice, given the roles they have had to perform. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] NSWADT 62">11 Mr Hall referred the Tribunal to the decision in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No 2) [2007] FCA 1445 ('the Telstra case'), where, at [21], the Federal Court said:
 

 
 
 "If a communication qualifies for legal professional privilege, the privilege is absolute. It cannot be overriden by some supposedly greater public interest. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] VSC 392">59 The next step in the respondents' argument is to say that an applicant cannot prove it "genuinely feels unable to decide to commence a proceeding" unless it discloses whether it has received legal advice and the content of any such legal advice. The authority relied upon in support of this proposition is the following comment by Graham J in the recent Federal Court decision of Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No 2) [14] : 
 
If information going to the ability of a person in the position of Telstra to make a decision whether to commence a proceeding in the Court against the Minister as a prospective respondent included information contained in documents which may otherwise enjoy legal professional privilege, it would seem surprising if the applicant could advance its claim for relief under [the equivalent in the Federal Court Rules of r 32.05] without laying bare all of the information which it had, whether privileged or not.

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] FCA 88">17 To put the proposition in different terms, if " it is in the other side's power to destroy the privilege entirely ," (see [15] above) it can no longer be said that the original holder can reasonably expect any continued confidentiality. In such circumstances, the existence of the privilege cannot be made to turn on whether the other side in fact places the document into evidence or uses it for examination - either legal privilege exists or it does not, and either the client controls it or they do not: Telstra Corporation Ltd v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No 2) [2007] FCA 1445 at [21] ( "If a communication qualifies for legal professional privilege, the privilege is absolute. It cannot be overridden by some supposedly greater public interest. It can be waived by the person, the client entitled to it, and it can be overridden by statute, but it is otherwise absolute. " ) In other words, once it is found that the original holder of the privilege cannot control further dissemination of the document, the privilege is destroyed as a matter of law without further inquiry into whether the communication was in fact disseminated. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] VCAT 166">Mr Smeaton drew my attention to a recent decision of Justice Graham of the Federal Court in Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts [No 2] [2007] FCA 1445. He submitted in summary that I should not find the documents were exempt as legally privileged because I could not be satisfied that Mr Fox was sufficiently independent. He relied on paragraph 35 of Justice Graham's reasons. It says : 
In my opinion an in-house lawyer will lack the requisite measure of independence if his or her advice is at risk of being compromised by virtue of the nature of his employment relationship with his employer. On the other hand, if the personal loyalties, duties and interests of the in-house lawyer do not influence the professional legal advice which he gives, the requirement for independence will be satisfied. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2007] FCA 1987">6 Client legal privilege exists to serve the public interest in the administration of justice by encouraging frank disclosure by clients to their lawyers. As Mason and Wilson JJ stated in Waterford v The Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 ( "Waterford" ) at 62, "the proper functioning of the legal system is facilitated by freedom of consultation between the client and the legal adviser". Their Honours went on to observe at pages 64-65 that legal professional privilege is the product of a balancing exercise between competing public interests whereby, subject to the well-recognised crime or fraud exception, the public interest in the administration of justice is accorded paramountcy over the public interest in a fair trial conducted by reference to all relevant documents (see also Esso Australia per Gleeson CJ and Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [35]). There is no further balancing exercise to be carried out; if client legal privilege attaches to a communication, the privilege may be waived or overridden by statue but is otherwise absolute ( Telstra Corporation Ltd v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No 2) [2007] FCA 1445 ( "Telstra" ) at [21]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2007] FCA 1557">23 First, they submit that the onus was on the applicant to establish his claim for privilege and that included adducing evidence that the Legal and Advice Branch was independent of the OWS. It was submitted that the applicant had put forward no evidence, or insufficient evidence, of the Legal and Advice Branch's independence. It was submitted that this case is similar to that before Graham J in Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No 2) [2007] FCA 1445 (" Telstra ") in which his Honour held that the absence of evidence establishing the independence of the internal legal advisers was fatal to the claim of privilege.</sentence>
