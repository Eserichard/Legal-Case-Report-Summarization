<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 302">In Bittmann v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) (No 2) [2006] FCA 1786 at [12] , Kenny J analysed the source of the court's power to dismiss an appeal brought under s 44 of the Act on the basis of failure to state a question of law as follows: 
 
 
 In McGregor v Chief Executive Officer of Centrelink [2000] FCA 701 at [17] , Spender J expressed the view that there was power under O 20 r 2 of the Rules to dismiss an appeal purportedly under s 44 of the AAT Act on the basis that it stated no question of law and thus disclosed no reasonable cause of action: see also Zoia v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2003] FCA 303 at [6] per Carr J and Barghouthi v ING Custodians Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1272 at [15] per Allsop J. In Lambroglou , Ryan J expressed the view (at 519) that O 53 r 15(1) of the Rules conferred a power sufficiently broad to allow the Court to strike out the whole or part of an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act. Whatever the correct analysis of the Rules, s 23 of the Federal Court Act confers broad power on the Court to make orders of such kinds as it thinks appropriate. I accept that, pursuant to s 23, the Court has power to strike out a notice of appeal in reliance on s 44 where the notice does not state a question of law: compare also Lambroglou at 519---520. 
 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 264">In my opinion, the existing notice of appeal must be struck out because it does not state a question of law as it is required to do by O 53 r 3(2) of the Federal Court Rules : see Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321 at 325 [18] per Branson and Stone JJ. This Court has the power to strike out a notice of appeal in such circumstances (see Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) s 23 ; Federal Court Rules O 53 rr 3(3) and 15; Bittman v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (No 2) [2006] FCA 1786 ; Australian Telecommunications Commission v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 420">In Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 , Ryan J expressed the view, at 519, that O 53 r 15(1) of the Rules conferred a power sufficiently broad to allow the Court to strike out the whole or part of an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act. His Honour went on to say at 520: 
 
 'Even if I be wrong in gleaning from O 53 a power to make an order of the kind sought in the present case, I consider that such a power is conferred by s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act or exists as part of the inherent jurisdiction of the Court which was invoked by Lee J in Whim Creek Consolidated NL v Colgan (at 5) citing Hughes Motor Service Pty Ltd v Wang Computer Pty Ltd [1978] FCA 49 ; (1978) 35 FLR 346 at 351. '

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1105">This Court has power to strike out a notice of appeal which does not state a question or questions of law: Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515. In Bittmann v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (No 2) [2006] FCA 1786 Kenny J said (at [12]): 
 
 "I also accept that, as the respondent submitted, the Court may make the orders that it seeks by way of its motion. In McGregor v Chief Executive Officer of Centrelink [2000] FCA 701 at [17] , Spender J expressed the view that there was power under O 20 r 2 of the Rules to dismiss an appeal purportedly under s 44 of the AAT Act on the basis that it stated no question of law and thus disclosed no reasonable cause of action: see also Zoia v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2003] FCA 303 at [6] per Carr J and Barghouthi v ING Custodians Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1272 at [15] per Allsop J.
