<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] AATA 730">It is accepted that there may be multiple medical conditions which cause a particular death ( Collins v Repatriation Commission (2008) FCA 1982 ; Repatriation Commission v Law (1981) HCA 57) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 90">3 Mrs Collins appealed to this Court (under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth)), claiming that the Tribunal's decision on that issue was infected by an error of law. The appeal was dismissed by a judge of the Court: Collins v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1982. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 521">The next issue for determination is what was the "kind of death", that is the condition(s) from which the veteran was suffering that contributed to his death. The veteran's "kind of death" has been defined as "the real or operative cause of death as opposed to the final stage of the process of dying" ( Re Brown and Repatriation Commission [2003] AATA 1010 at para 6). The Tribunal in that decision referred to the words of the High Court in Fitzgerald v Penn [1954] HCA 74 ; (1954) 91 CLR 268 at 276 which said that the Tribunal must ascertain whether a particular illness or disease could fairly and properly be considered the cause of death. Emmett J in Collins v Repatriation Commission (2008) FCA 1982 said at para 21 that: 
 "The question of the kind of death met by a veteran is a question of medical causation of the death, although that might include contributing or underlying causes in a sense to which I have already referred". 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 418">There are conflicting Federal Court authorities about whether we must test the kind of death against any SoP in force before we determine the kind of death. The requirement that we first determine the 'kind of death' that the veteran met is confirmed in Repatriation Commission v Hancock [2003] FCA 711 ; (2003) 37 AAR 383 ('Hancock'), Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 ; (2007) 95 ALD 619 ('Codd') and in Collins v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1982 ('Collins'). </sentence>
