<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1040">In addition to these matters, the applicant relied on various other decisions as indicative of a prior history on the Union's part. In particular, the applicant argued that the Union had a substantial history of engaging in similar conduct because it had been found to have engaged in unlawful coercion on numerous previous occasions contrary to: s 187AB(1)(b) of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth), citing Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 ; Cruse v Multiplex Ltd [2008] FCAFC 179 ; (2008) 172 FCR 279 and Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 495 ; s 170NC of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act , citing Alfred v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (Decision of Hughes J, NSW District Court, 5 March 2004); Alfred v Walter Construction Group Limited [2005] FCA 497 ; A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 1047 ; (2007) 165 IR 94 ; Cruse v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1267 ; (2008) 175 IR 447 ; and Martino v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (Magistrates Court of Victoria, 10 May 2006); s 298P of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act , citing Hadgkiss v Blevin [2004] FCA 697 ; and Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Hamberger [2003] FCAFC 38 ; (2003) 125 IR 183 ; and s 298S(2)(b) of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act , citing Alfred v Lancsar [2007] FCA 1001 ; (2007) 167 IR 320. </sentence>

Reliance is placed on Inspector Cruse v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1267 ; (2008) 175 IR 447 (the substantive proceeding) and Cruse v CFMEU (No 2) [2008] FCA 1637 (the penalty proceeding) as an example of contraventions of ss 298SC and 170NC of the Act by the CFMEU. The Union was vicariously liable for the conduct of its delegate, Mr Fry. The conduct involved Mr Fry falsely telling a self-employed building contractor engaged to do work on a building site that he was required to join the CFMEU (the s 298SC breach) and falsely telling the contractor that he was required to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement (the s 170NC breach). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1804">35 As was said in Cruse v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1267 at [18] :
 Intention to coerce requires intent to exert pressure that would in a practical sense negate choice: see National Tertiary Education Industry Union at 143. Negation of choice can be contrasted with a desire to influence, persuade or induce. The question will be, as Weinberg J said in National Tertiary Education Industry Union at 143, whether "a person is left with a realistic choice as to whether or not to comply". The objective of the organisers in their 24 October 2005 discussion with Mr Noble was to "influence, persuade or induce". Vaughan was left with a realistic choice not to comply and did not comply.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1637">1 On 22 August 2008, the Court published its reasons for judgment in Cruse v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1267 ("the substantive judgment"). In the substantive judgment, the Court held that Mr Fry, a delegate of the respondent Union, breached ss 298SC and 170NC of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the WR Act "). It also found the Union vicariously liable for Mr Fry's breaches. This judgment should be read together with the substantive judgment. It deals with the issue of what penalties, if any, should be imposed on Mr Fry and the Union.
