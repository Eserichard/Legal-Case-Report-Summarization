<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCAFC 134">
 

16 In his reasons for judgment ( Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 626) the primary judge said at [42] --- [44]:
 
 '42 ... the Minister has proceeded throughout upon the basis that Mr Moore had an absorbed person visa as at 1 September 1994, having satisfied the requirements of s 34(2)(b) of the Act [as at 2 April 1984] . That was the stance initially taken by the applicant as well. However, he no longer maintains that position.</sentence>
