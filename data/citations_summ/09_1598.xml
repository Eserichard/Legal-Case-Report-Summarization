<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 23">The position must now be considered in the light of s 17F(1A) of the Act: see In the matter of Westport Insurance Corporation (No 2) [2009] FCA 1598 at [35] . That subsection provides: 
 
 'In deciding whether to confirm a scheme (with or without modifications), the
 Federal Court must have regard to: 
 

 
 
 (a) the interests of the policyholders of a body corporate affected by the scheme; and 
 

 
 
 (b) if a report relevant to all or part of the scheme has been filed with the Court under section 62ZI --- that report; and 
 

 
 
 (c) any other matter the Court considers relevant. ' 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 9">Section 17F(1A), which was introduced into the Act by the Financial System Legislation Amendment (Financial Claims Scheme and Other Measures) Act 2008 (Cth) (No 105, 2008), s 3 , Schedule 3, Item 7 has clarified this issue. The reference to "policyholders of a body corporate affected by the scheme" clearly includes the policyholders of both the transferor and the transferee. In Re Westport Insurance Corporation, in the matter of Westport Corporation (No 2) [2009] FCA 1598 ; (2009) 181 FCR 530 at [36] ff Lindgren J raised the question of whether the section 
 
 encompasses the interests of the holders of policies issued otherwise than as part of the business of an Australian branch. In other words, must the Court have regard to the interests of the holders of policies issued in any of its branches anywhere in the world by a foreign general insurer that is affected by the scheme? 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 669">The position must now be considered in the light of section 17F(1A) of the Act. Lindgren J referred to this in Westport Insurance Corporation, in the matter of Westport Insurance Corporation (No 2) [2009] FCA 1598 at [35] ff. I do not need to set out that subsection, which was introduced by legislation passed in 2008. What is important is paragraph (a) of that subsection, which requires the court, in deciding whether to confirm a scheme, to have regard to the interests of the policyholders of a body corporate affected by the scheme. </sentence>
