<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 956">These principles have been applied in many cases. Not surprisingly the Respondents place reliance on cases, such as BWK Elders (Australia) Pty Ltd v Westgate Wool Co Pty Ltd (No 6) [2002] FCA 807 and Intercoal Ltd v Tarong Energy Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 85 in which the Court granted applications to transfer; and the Applicants drew attention to cases such as Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pauls Ltd [2002] FCA 71 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Virgin Mobile Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1239 in which transfer applications were refused. These decisions are of limited assistance given the wide range of variables which confronted the judges who decided them. They included the questions of whether pleadings had closed and whether the witnesses to be called at trial were known at the time at which the application was made. </sentence>
