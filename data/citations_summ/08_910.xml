<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1022">His Honour found that the Tribunal summarised the contents of the passage from Amnesty International, and directly addressed whether in the future the applicant would be at risk by reason of having the "profile" which it found to have been held by the persons who were persecuted in 2006. His Honour stated at [24]: 
 
 "It was therefore directly addressing the applicant's claim that he would in the future be at the same risk as the persons who were persecuted in the past. " 

On appeal Cowdroy J found no error in his Honour's approach (see: SZLNW v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 910). In SZLNW , it is clear that the Tribunal directly addressed the applicant's claim and found that the applicant would not be at risk if there were reprisal attacks. In the present case, however, the Tribunal's finding was dependent upon its assumption that the removal of Commodore Bainimarama or a coup would not occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 942">The applicant also sought support from the decision of Cowdroy J in SZLNW v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 910 where his Honour, relying on SZBEL and in particular the second of the three extracts above found that SZBEL did apply. In order to see whether the same could be said in the instant case it is necessary to look at the facts which were considered by the High Court in SZBEL and by Cowdroy J in SZLNW . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 854">In the recent decision of SZLNW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 910 , Cowdroy J indicated that SZBEL makes it plain that if a Tribunal is to make a decision adverse to an applicant for a specific reason, it is obliged to put that to the applicant and invite a response. His Honour relied on SZBEL at [47]: First, there may well be cases, perhaps many cases, where either the delegate's decision, or the Tribunal's statements or questions during a hearing, sufficiently indicate to an applicant that everything he or she says in support of the application is in issue. That indication may be given in many ways. It is not necessary (and often would be inappropriate) for the Tribunal to put to an applicant, in so many words, that he or she is lying, that he or she may not be accepted as a witness of truth, or that he or she may be thought to be embellishing the account that is given of certain events. The proceedings are not adversarial and the Tribunal is not, and is not to adopt the position of, a contradictor. But where, as here, there are specific aspects of an applicant's account, that the Tribunal considers may be important to the decision and may be open to doubt, the Tribunal must at least ask the applicant to expand upon those aspects of the account and ask the applicant to explain why the account should be accepted.
