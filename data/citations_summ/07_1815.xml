 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1586">62 In Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 11) [2007] FCA 1815 it had been found that the respondent had committed contempt of court by failing to pay a fine imposed on him by a Full Court within the time stipulated. Tracey J outlined (at [8]) the considerations which were relevant to the determination of penalties for contempt including that:
 &#8226; Mr Siminton has not apologised, expressed regret or in any other way sought to purge his contempt. &#8226; Mr Siminton is an undischarged bankrupt who has failed to provide a statement of his affairs in accordance with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) and has not provided evidence of his personal and financial circumstances. &#8226; Mr Siminton claims to be impecunious. &#8226; Mr Siminton has a friend who might be disposed to provide an undisclosed amount of money to meet any fine which might be imposed by the court. </sentence>
