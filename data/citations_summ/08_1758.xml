<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 237">Counsel for Mr Basile sought to contrast the sense in which the phrase "taken into account" was used by Lord Hewart CJ with the sense in which it is currently employed in Australian administrative law. He referred to the authorities, collected by Rares J in Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1758 at [105] - [107]. His Honour there said: 
 
 "[105] I am of opinion that when s 152CR(1)(d) required the Commission, in making a final determination, to take into account Telstra's direct costs of providing access to the ULLS in the manner the Commission proposed, it was required to take that matter into account, together with the other matters referred to in the section, and to give weight to them as a fundamental element in making its decision: The Queen v Toohey; Ex parte Meneling Station Pty Limited [1982] HCA 69 ; (1982) 158 CLR 327 at 333 per Gibbs CJ applying what Mason J had said in Sean Investments 180 CLR at 329 to a section requiring a decision-maker to take a variety of matters into account. Mason J said that the requirement to have regard to a matter meant that it would become a central element for the decision-maker in his considerations: Meneling Station 158 CLR at 338.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 53">In SZJSS Rares J held (at 280 [43]) that the Tribunal's statement that it gave "no weight" to letters corroborating the appellants' claims in the circumstances of that case was inconsistent with "any rational, reasonable approach to the evaluation of that evidence"; and, because of this, his Honour concluded that the Tribunal "was not genuinely considering the appellants' claims as corroborated by the letters on the material before it". His Honour explained (at 280-1 [43]) that: 
 
 [The Tribunal] used the formula of giving material "no weight" as a basis on which it might ignore probative, relevant and highly supportive material corroborating the factual basis of the fears which the husband claimed. It did this simply as a basis for putting the evidence to one side, having said that it had looked at it.

Here, there was no suggestion that Siam's dumping had caused any injury to Qenos in the review period. One question for the Minister to consider was whether he was satisfied that importation of the dumped product by Siam had caused, was then causing or threatening to cause material injury to the Australian industry as s 269TG(2)(b) required.

The material in Report 137 was inadequate to establish that the CEO and the Minister had considered what was shown in confidential appendix 7 as undercutting, in accordance with s 269TAE(2), by not attributing any factor other than dumping as being likely to cause material injury. They took the undercutting itself into account as material establishing the likelihood of a threat of material injury. But, that material begged questions, that were left unanswered, as to why the differences in price appeared and what injury was likely to be caused. Because of this inadequacy, the CEO and the Minister did not, in fact, have sufficient material on which to be satisfied that expiration of the measures would be likely to lead to a threat of material injury to Qenos caused by Siam's dumping: see Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1758 ; (2008) 107 ALD 474 at 518-519 [180] - [182] where I examined the authorities; R v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Company Pty Ltd (1953) 188 CLR 100 at 120 per Dixon CJ, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ.

<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FCA 528">Often the three primary considerations in Direction No 21 will tend in different directions. The best interests of a visa holder's child may often be to remain with his or her parent, while the protection of the Australian community or its expectations may tend in the other direction. As I said in Telstra [2008] FCA 1758 at [110], in the context of ordinary principles of administrative decision-making, where fundamental weight must be given to a particular factor or factors, the requirement is that the decision-maker treat consideration of the factors, as opposed to the factors themselves, is a central element in the deliberative process. It will be in this manner that he or she will give appropriate weight to those factors. I am of opinion that par 2.17 permits the decision-maker to accommodate such an interpretation. It refers to other 11 factors that, where relevant, it may be appropriate for the decision-maker to take into account, but as par 2.17 continued, it was the government's view that: 
 "... generally they be given less individual weight than that given to the primary considerations. " 

  In Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41, Mason J explained that in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it was generally for the decision-maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters that are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power. But he said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no importance. Mason J cautioned that the preferred ground on which that judicial power was to be exercised was that the decision was "manifestly unreasonable".
