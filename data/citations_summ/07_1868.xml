<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 9">From 9 April 2008 ASIC entered into without prejudice negotiations with the defendants, apart from APM, in an attempt to resolve the proceeding without the need for a lengthy trial. Mr Day said that there were a number of reasons for ASIC taking this approach: 
(a) the liquidation of APM had resumed so that an officer of the Court, the liquidator, was now in a position to investigate further the affairs of APM and inter-company transfers between the defendants;
 
 
(b) ASIC had received an interim report from APM's liquidator on 5 March 2008 which suggested that, although the liquidator's investigations were continuing, no significant additional assets were held outside APM and MK River;
 
 
(c) the report as to the affairs of the receiver of MK River dated 19 December 2007 suggested that that company was hopelessly insolvent and ASIC considered that there should be little resistance to the appointment of a liquidator which would complement the work of APM's liquidator in his investigations;
 
 
(d) the scheme which ASIC contended, and still contends, was a managed investment scheme, had effectively ceased operation and there was no ongoing risk to the public;
 
 
(e) in a judgment delivered on 29 November 2007 in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1868 ; (2007) 164 FCR 487 , Finkelstein J had considered declarations of contravention against individuals in similar circumstances as this proceeding although he had suggested limitations not relevant for present purposes;
 
 
(f) ASIC considered that there was a low probability of it recovering its costs from the defendants;
 
 
(g) AF had been deregistered on 10 September 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCAFC 147">303 Nor do I need to consider whether a declaration would have had any utility: see eg Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1868 ; (2007) 164 FCR 487 at [14] ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v FUELbanc Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 960 ; (2007) 162 FCR 174 at [61] .

More recently a bare declaration was granted by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1868 ; (2007) 164 FCR 487. The Court declared that the "scheme" in question was an unregistered managed investment scheme in contravention of s 601ED(5) of the Act. His Honour said that the power to do so may be exercised whether or not other relief is sought and rejected the defendant's submission that a mere declaration would have no utility as the scheme had already been wound up following the winding up of the HLP companies, for the reason that: 
 ... it is appropriate to make the declaration sought by ASIC. Many people put money into the scheme. They are entitled to know that the scheme was illegal and that is one reason why the HLP group was wound up. The declaration will not enable the investors to recover their money. But at least it will inform them what they had got themselves into.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] AATA 489">34. On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that the decision of Goldberg J in Sage "is in error" and referred to two decisions to support that submission. Those decisions were Re AWB Limited: Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Flugge [2008] VSC 473 ; (2008) 252 ALR 566 and Australian Securities and Investment Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1868 ; (2007) 164 FCR 487. Particular emphasis was placed on the decision of Robson J of Supreme Court of Victoria in Re AWB where, (at [58]) his Honour said as follows:
 
 "For the purposes of this case I assume I am bound to follow the McMahon v Gould [105] line of authorities. Nevertheless, I wish to add my voice to those at first instance suggesting that an appellate court may wish to reconsider McMahon v Gould.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 645">However the situation is not as clear as was suggested by the submission of counsel for the respondents. Indeed there is a divergence of approach to the question of whether a declaration should be made in civil proceedings about conduct which is also criminal conduct and in respect of which charges may be brought. The divergence is apparent in a discussion by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1868 ; (2007) 164 FCR 487 at [51] and following. His Honour refers to some of the more recent authorities. Finkelstein J. said at [58]: 
 
 I would sum up the position as I see it as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] QSC 162">[3] This case also falls within one of the exceptions to the general reluctance of the civil courts to intervene to restrain criminal behaviour, that is to enjoin those who continue to flout the law; [4] but, more importantly, the applicant will suffer irreparable injury if the relief be not granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] QSC 58">One should not make a declaration which might be falsified by a subsequent acquittal in proceedings between the same parties"
 
 [235] That approach is consistent with the view expressed by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [134] : 
 
"The English and Australian authorities that warn of the dangers of a civil court becoming involved in criminal conduct continue to apply in an appropriate company case.</sentence>

Advertisements caused to be published by the plaintiff in marketing residential land make representation as to a likely price range for the sale of the land which is less than the prescribed minimum advertising price, as those terms are defined by the Land and Business (Sale and Conveyancing) Act 1994 (SA) ("the Act"), for the purposes of s 24A of the Act - appropriate to make a declaration to that effect, notwithstanding the impact that declaration may have on future criminal proceedings which may be commenced against the plaintiff under the Act.

17 The emergence of a criminal prosecution would very likely result in a stay of these proceedings: see, for example, Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1868 ; (2007) 164 FCR 487. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 1900">27 The judgment of Finkelstein J considered by Robson J was that given by his Honour in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1868 ; (2007) 164 FCR 487. As Robson J (at [63]) noted, the following passage [2007] FCA 1868 ; (164 FCR 487 at [58] ) summarises the conclusion reached by Finkelstein J in relation to the making of a declaratory judgment by a civil court with respect to criminal conduct:
 The English and Australian authorities that warn of the dangers of a civil court becoming involved in criminal conduct continue to apply in an appropriate company case. The general rule in a company case is that a civil court will usually be the appropriate court to deal with a contravention of the Corporations Act. 27 The judgment of Finkelstein J considered by Robson J was that given by his Honour in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1868 ; (2007) 164 FCR 487. As Robson J (at [63]) noted, the following passage [2007] FCA 1868 ; (164 FCR 487 at [58] ) summarises the conclusion reached by Finkelstein J in relation to the making of a declaratory judgment by a civil court with respect to criminal conduct:
 The English and Australian authorities that warn of the dangers of a civil court becoming involved in criminal conduct continue to apply in an appropriate company case. The general rule in a company case is that a civil court will usually be the appropriate court to deal with a contravention of the Corporations Act. But the court should be wary of granting relief, including the grant of a declaration or an injunction, if the case is likely to end up before a criminal court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] VSC 473">20 The defendants also rely on ASIC v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) [15] where the Federal Court of Australia stayed a civil proceeding for an injunction to restrain conduct that also constituted a criminal offence under the Corporations Act 2001 . Mr Flugge and Mr Ingelby also rely on the Charter of Human Rights. [16]  24 Thus the issues arising on each of these applications are: 
(1) What are the relevant principles to granting a stay of civil proceedings? (2) Have the stay principles been altered or refined by Reid v Howard? [17] 
(3) Have the stay principles been altered or refined by ASIC v HLP Financial Planning? [18] 
(4) Applying those principles, should a stay be granted?  98 The features of Part 9.4B indicate that the civil penalty proceedings should not be treated as a separate civil right that a litigant has and the issue before the Court on a stay application is only the timing of the hearing of the civil claim. Rather, in my opinion, the civil penalty proceedings are one part of a punishment and enforcement regime imposed on company officers who fail to observe their obligations under the Corporations Act 2001 . That regime is a mixture of civil, civil penalty and criminal procedure. [171] It is relevant, therefore, in applying the McMahon v Gould [172] guidelines to take account of the interrelationship between civil penalty proceedings and criminal proceedings as set out in Part 9.4B of the Corporations Act 2001 and the effective statutory amendment of those principles.  Only the most serious contraventions now end up before a criminal court. Nonetheless when a criminal proceeding is commenced the criminal court should be given (and in many cases is expressly given) priority over civil litigation. [110]  63 Finkelstein J summarised the position as follows: 
 
 The English and Australian authorities that warn of the dangers of a civil court becoming involved in criminal conduct continue to apply in an appropriate company case. The general rule in a company case is that a civil court will usually be the appropriate court to deal with a contravention of the Corporations Act . But the court should be wary of granting relief, including the grant of a declaration or an injunction, if the case is likely to end up before a criminal court. Ordinarily, a civil court should not intervene in those circumstances unless its failure to do so will result in irreparable injury. That strict rule need not be applied if the case involves undisputed facts and the issue raised gives rise to a question of pure law. Then a declaration can be a very useful remedy. As Barwick CJ said in Commonwealth v Sterling Nicholas Duty Free Pty Ltd [112] that is the kind of case "which contributes enormously to the utility of the jurisdiction. " [113] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] NSWSC 1013">74 The Court is less reluctant to make a declaration involving questions of criminal law where the facts are clear and undisputed, there are no criminal proceedings pending, and there is a pure question of law to be decided: see e.g. Crane v Gething [2000] FCA 45 , at [30]; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1868 , at [58].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] VCAT 1341">Mr Abbott also relied upon ASIC v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd [12] for the proposition that a civil court should not interfere with a matter likely to be the subject of criminal charges. From my brief review, I do not consider that case directly relevant here. The civil proceeding in that case was concerned with the making of an actual declaration of criminal conduct and whether the applicant should be charged with criminal offences, and there was some overlap in the jurisdiction. Here, there is not the same inter-relationship. </sentence>
