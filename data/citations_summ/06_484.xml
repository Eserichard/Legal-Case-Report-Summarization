<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 779">It is not open to me to review the fact-finding of the tribunal today on the basis of further factual material that the applicant may be able to provide as that is also outside the scope of judicial review. 13. The issue that remains is one quite properly identified by counsel for the minister, which arises from comments made by Collier J in Kankanamage v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 484 where her Honour, when dealing with a Migration Review Tribunal matter, made the following comments: 
 
 
 '26 This submission gave rise to an interesting threshold question --- namely if the Tribunal had not specifically directed their minds towards whether the nominator was suffering from a prolonged illness within the meaning of the reg 1.03, did it follow that the decision of the Tribunal in relation to the visa application was affected by jurisdictional error. 
 27 The respondents submitted that the decision would not have been so affected. The respondents submitted that, in order for the appellant to succeed, he must show that the findings of the Tribunal on each individual requirement of the definition of 'special need relative' were affected by jurisdictional error.</sentence>
