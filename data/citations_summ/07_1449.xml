<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 840">[10] AHRC Act , s.46PO. [11] Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria &amp; Anor (No. 4) [2007] FCA 1449 ; (2007) 97 ALD 721 at 730 per Middleton J; [2007] FCA 1449 at paras.47-48 per Middleton J ("Bahonko (No. 4)") . An application for leave to appeal the judgment in Bahonko (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1300">The discretion under O 3 r 3 of the Rules to extend any time fixed by the Rules is granted to the Court to ensure that injustice is avoided to the parties. Generally, in considering whether to exercise the discretion to extend time, the Court will examine the explanation for the delay, the amount of delay, whether the plaintiff has an arguable case and, finally, whether any prejudice would be suffered by the defendant to the application. These principles are summarised in Bahonko v The Nurses Board of Victoria (No 4) [2007] FCA 1449 at [48] in relation to a similar statutory provision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1073">As Deane J observed, the explanation required will depend on the circumstances of the case. In addition to the explanation for the delay, however, it has generally been accepted, in relation to a wide range of applications, that it is also necessary to consider the likelihood of prejudice to the respondent and whether the applicant for an extension of time has an arguable case: Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-349 per Wilcox J; Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [21] to [24] per Weinberg J; Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria (No 4) [2007] FCA 1449 ; (2007) 97 ALD 721 at [48] per Middleton J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1024">In Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria (No 4) [2007] FCA 1449 ; (2007) 97 ALD 721 , Middleton J considered at [47] and [48] the principles to be applied in exercising the discretion under s 46PO(2) of the HREOC Act and held that the three main matters that need to be taken into account are: 
(a) The explanation of the delay;
 
(b) any prejudice to the respondent; and
 
(c) whether the applicant has an arguable case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1043">18 Appeals from decisions of the Tribunal to this Court are confined to " a question of law " and are to be filed within 28 days: Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), s 44(1) and (2A)(a). Prima facie the rule is that proceedings commenced outside the prescribed 28 day period ought not to be entertained: Jeilles v Secretary, Department of Employment &amp; Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1590 at [9] . There is, however, a discretion to extend that time. The principles relevant to that discretion have been conveniently set forth by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 and those principles have since been repeatedly applied in a variety of contexts in which an extension of time is sought: eg, Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria (No 4) [2007] FCA 1449 at [47] ---[48] [2007] FCA 1449 ; , 97 ALD 721 at 730; SZGCA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 224 at [4] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCAFC 29">1 On 14 September 2007 Middleton J in a comprehensive and closely reasoned judgment dismissed Ms Bahonko's application for leave to file out of time an application pursuant to s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1996 (Cth) ( Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria (No 4) [2007] FCA 1449). The judgment traces a complicated history explaining the origins of Ms Bahonko's claim. Reference should be made directly to it for an understanding of the matters which Ms Bahonko wished to pursue and the manner in which her allegations were advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1591">4 Other than those matters already dealt with on 5 April 2007, the respondents have been successful in resisting the application and the applicant's various notices of motion brought in this proceeding: Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria (No 4) [2007] FCA 1449. The Court has already made costs orders in respect of the issues decided in the applicant's favour on 5 April 2007. </sentence>
