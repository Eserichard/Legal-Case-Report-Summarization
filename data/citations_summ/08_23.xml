<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 148">1 These taxation appeals and cross-appeals are from a judgment of a single judge of the Court in which his Honour allowed the respondent's appeals against the appellant's objection decisions: Tasman Group Services Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 23. The objection decisions related to the application of the "Forgiveness of commercial debts" provisions contained in Div 245 of Sch 2C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (1936 Act). The "map" of Div 245 as set out in s 245-3 indicates that Div 245 is concerned to require the "total net forgiven amount" of all commercial debts forgiven in the same year of income to be applied to reduce certain revenue and capital losses, deductible amounts and the cost bases of certain assets attributable to the taxpayer whose debt has been forgiven. Div 245 provides a method for the valuation of the "total net forgiven amount" of the commercial debts to which it applies. </sentence>
