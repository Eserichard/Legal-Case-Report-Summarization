<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 394">In McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 , a case that dealt with the payment of costs under s 824 of the former Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) as amended by the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth), Buchanan J considered that costs could be awarded against a party for refusing a reasonable offer of settlement, on the basis it constitute " an unreasonable act or omission, [which] caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 231">It is difficult to bring the offer within the precise terms of O 23 of the Federal Court Rules . For one thing the respondent and cross-claimant does not ask me to give effect to O 23 r 11 as to the costs before the offer. However, even if the offer does not fall within the terms of O 23 the offer was a reasonable one and one the offeror bettered at trial. It is a 'good start' and relevant to the discretion as to costs if the offeree's rejection of the offer at the time it was made was imprudent or (plainly) unreasonable: McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 (' McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) ') at 597 [22]-[23] per Buchanan J; APF Properties Pty Ltd v Kestrel Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2016 at [18] - [25] per Heerey J). Like Buchanan J in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) I need only consider if the rejection or non-acceptance of the offer was imprudent and I need not consider whether the other limb of the test is unreasonable (see Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] - [218]), or plainly unreasonable (see The Sanko Steamship Company Ltd v Sumitomo Australia Ltd [1996] FCA 22 ; Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 304">In the present case, the parties' disagreement as to costs centred on the application of O 23 r 11(6) of the Rules, which commenced operation on 2 August 2008. Rule 11(6) applies in the circumstances described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of that rule, including where an applicant fails altogether to obtain relief after a respondent has made an offer of compromise. Previous statements to the effect that O 23 r 11 did not cover such a circumstance pre-date the introduction of rule 11(6): see, e.g., McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 at 597 and Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at 381. </sentence>

In that regard, it may be, as Buchanan J highlights in the following passage from his judgment in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 at 597, [22] , that there is a difference in opinion at intermediate appellate level as to whether, for the purpose of satisfying a condition precedent to the awarding of indemnity costs and as an alternative to "imprudent", the rejection of an offer of compromise should be able to be described as "unreasonable" or "plainly unreasonable": In Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 ( Dukemaster) Sundberg and Emmett JJ said, in a case like the present where O 23 r 11 did not apply because an applicant had been wholly unsuccessful, that an applicant for a more generous award of costs than party-party costs 'must show that the rejection of the offer was imprudent or plainly unreasonable' (see at [7]). There has been doubt expressed about the soundness of the statement in Dukemaster that rejection of an offer, if unreasonable, must be 'plainly unreasonable' in the light of the earlier judgment of a Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] --- [218], to which Wilcox J also referred in Coshott (see Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1489 at [59] --- [62]). 
In the earlier of the Full Court authorities, Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at 432-433, [218] , the point was made that the conduct of an offeree need not be "plainly unreasonable" in order to warrant the ordering of indemnity costs because "To adopt an especially high standard of unreasonableness would operate as a fetter on the discretion to award indemnity costs and diminish the effectiveness of the Calderbank offer as an incentive to settlement. " I respectfully agree and, for that reason, would choose to follow the earlier Full Court authority were that to be critical to the resolution of the costs application. It is not though because in both Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 and Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 the alternative of imprudent rejection was acknowledged. Like Buchanan J in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) and, as his Honour noted (at [22]), like Heerey J in AFP Properties Pty Ltd v Kestrel Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2016 at [24] --- [25], it is sufficient to assess whether the rejection of any of the offers was, "imprudent". That basis of assessment accords with the exemplar given by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited , which I have already noted, whose judgment, as Heerey J acknowledged in AFP Properties (ibid), is the locus classicus on the subject. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCAFC 40">7 In reliance on rule 11(6) the respondents submitted that there were no relevant matters which would lead the Court to make an order "contrary to the presumption" in the rule. In answer the appellant contended that rule 11(5) does not apply to an applicant/appellant who has been wholly unsuccessful, relying on McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 and Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489. On that basis the appellant asserted that an award of indemnity costs could not be made unless the respondents demonstrated that its refusal of the offer was "imprudent or unreasonable": Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 at [6] . It is clear therefore that the parties did not at that stage join issue on the applicable rule, namely rule 11(6). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1776">11 In McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) and Another (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 Buchanan J was requested to make a gross sum costs order but declined to do so. At 600 his Honour observed there was no reason why the assessment of costs should not receive the attention of a taxing officer who is accustomed to, and experienced in, dealing with such matters. The Court finds that the same considerations apply in this instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 749">In McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 Buchanan J considered the above authorities (at [16] to [18]) and said at [27]: "27. That leaves the question of costs prior to the abandonment of claims under the WR Act. The first question is whether it is possible to disentangle and separate the federal statutory claims prior to this date.

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Introduction 
 On 16 May 2008 the Court made orders, for the reasons set out in Bognar v Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (No.1) [2008] FMCA 571 , dismissing the applicant's amended application filed 29 January 2007.  In my view and as in the case of McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 consideration of all the claims, statutory and common law in this case, required reference to the same substratum of facts to finally determine the controversy between the parties. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 792">7 Because the applicant failed altogether, the question of whether indemnity costs should be awarded as a result of the offer of compromise is not dealt with by O 23 r 11 of the Federal Court Rules . The test to be applied is whether Ms Thompson was imprudent or unreasonable (or perhaps plainly unreasonable) to reject the offer of compromise (see McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 at [21] --- [23]). The difficulty which the respondent faces in its application for indemnity costs is that the only offer it made with respect to the proceedings under the HREOC Act was that the claim be dismissed with no order as to costs. Although I was invited to consider the totality of the offer I think consideration should be confined to the offer made with respect to the proceedings in which the costs order is now sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCAFC 30">30 The question whether costs with respect to separate federal claims within the original jurisdiction of the Court are affected by the restrictions on the award of costs appearing in the WR Act has not received prior attention by a Full Court. In Seven Network it was held that separate federal proceedings are not shielded from costs by s 347 of the WR Act (now s 824) notwithstanding earlier decisions of the Court to the effect that common law causes of action heard together with claims under the WR Act were so protected (see e.g. Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority (No 2) (2000) 94 IR 404 at [61]-[70] and the cases there referred to). Seven Network was followed by the primary judge in the decision under appeal and in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086. </sentence>
