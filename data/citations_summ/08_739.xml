<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 650">It was further submitted, however, that the Tribunal did put information about inconsistencies to the Applicant in accordance with the provisions of s.424AA of the Act. The Minister referred to the decision of SZLQD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [7] and SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [8] . The submission is that the Tribunal complied with s.424AA and did not fall into error on that basis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 537">Section 424AA of the Act applies to applications for review lodged after 29 June 2007: see Migration Amendment (Review Provisions) Act ; see also SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [13] . Since the application for review was filed on 5 September 2007, s 424AA is operative to this appeal. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCAFC 46">99 When the decision of Marshall J in SZLQD [2008] FCA 739 is added to the list compiled by his Honour, and his Honour's decision is taken into account, there are now decisions of seven judges of this Court all to the same effect and all contrary to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant in this case. 48 Counsel for the first respondent submitted that the only consequence of non-compliance with the specific requirements of s 424AA is that the Tribunal does not get the benefit of the provisions of s 424A(2A). It was submitted on behalf of the first respondent that this interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions was supported by five cases in this Court, namely: SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] ; SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 103 ALD 589 , [2008] FCA 1270 at [27] ; and SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134 at [19] ; SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 at [23]; and SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 105 ALD 541 , [2008] FCA 1866 at [56] ---[60]. Each of those cases was decided by a single judge sitting on appeal from a Federal Magistrate. The decisions contain the views of five judges of this Court. Each authority is recent. They constitute a consistent body of recent authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 271">These sections are not activated by internal inconsistencies in an applicant's claim or by a Tribunal's doubts about those claims: SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [18] ; SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 ; (2008) 103 ALD 589 at [25] - [28]. These sections do not apply to independent country information: VJAF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 178 at [13] - [15]; SZLQD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] . Ms Griffin submits that there was no information before the Tribunal that could trigger either s.424A or s. 424AA . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 167">The amended application added a third ground that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 424AA(b)(iv) of the Act. The Federal Magistrate correctly found that this section does not impose a mandatory obligation on the Tribunal. Rather, s 424AA complements the Tribunal's obligations under s 424A by enabling the Tribunal, if it so chooses, to give to an applicant orally during the hearing any information which the Tribunal considers would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. The explanatory memorandum to the bill which introduced s 424AA explains that this section provides a new discretion for the Tribunal to orally give information and invite an applicant to comment on or respond to the information at the time that the applicant is appearing before the Tribunal in response to an invitation issued under s 425. This discretion is meant to complement the Tribunal's existing obligation under s 424A in that if the Tribunal does not orally give information and seek comments or a response from an applicant under s 424AA, it must do so in writing under s 424A. However, if the Tribunal does give clear particulars of the information and seek comments or a response from an applicant under s 424AA, it is not required to give the particulars under s 424A: SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 139">As the Court said in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] : 
 [Section 424AA] places no obligation on the Tribunal but enables it, if it so chooses, to orally give to an applicant any information which the Tribunal considers would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. It does not compel the Tribunal to orally give an applicant any particulars of country information which it intends to rely on. So much is apparent from that part of the explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill which introduced s 424AA where the following was said: 

New section 424AA provides a new discretion for the RRT to orally give information and invite an applicant to comment on or respond to the information at the time that the applicant is appearing before the RRT in response to an invitation issued under section 425. This will complement the RRT's existing obligation under section 424A , in that, if the RRT does not orally give information and seek comments or a response from an applicant under section 424AA , it must do so in writing, under section 424A. The corollary is that if the RRT does give clear particulars of the information and seek comments or a response from an applicant under section 424AA , it is not required to give the particulars under section 424A. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 83">Section 424AA itself imposes no obligation upon the Tribunal. It provides an alternative means by which the Tribunal may give to the applicant 'information' that it is otherwise required to give in writing pursuant to s 424A(1) of the Act. A jurisdictional error will only arise if there is a breach of s 424A ( SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 at [23] ---[28]; SZLWI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [17] ---[21]; SZLQD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] ). There was no 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1) , and s 424AA was not engaged. I agree with these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 68">Section 424AA is not mandatory. The section enables the Tribunal, if it so chooses, to orally give to an applicant particulars of any information which the Tribunal considers would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. [6] 'Information' for the purpose of s.424AA has the same meaning as in s.424A. [7] There can be no breach of s.424AA in the absence of s.424A being engaged by the information concerned. This means that any such information must not only fall within s.424A(1) but also not be excluded by s.424A(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1866">58 It has been held on a number of occasions in this Court that ss 424AA and 424A provide specifically how certain matters are to be brought to the attention of an applicant by a tribunal, and that s 424AA enables information which would need to be given in writing under s 424A to be given orally if an applicant appears before a tribunal: see SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] per Marshall J; SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 at [27] per Cowdroy J; SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134 , 139 at [19] per Gilmour J; and SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 at [23] per Edmonds J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 1606">As to the alleged breach of s.424A , Mr Godwin submitted that unless the Applicant was able to particularise and prove that a matter was not put to him by the Member in the course of the hearing then there appears to be a compliance with ss.424A and 424AA . He referred the Court to SZLXU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [13] and SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [14] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 1817">12 The second ground alleged that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 424AA in regard to the independent country information that stated that workers can complain to the Labour Bureau. Her Honour found that no obligation arose pursuant to s 424AA to disclose that information and there was no jurisdictional error in this regard. Her Honour accepted that s 424AA does not impose any obligation on the Tribunal, but creates a means of compliance with s 424A , and 'does not compel the Tribunal to orally give an applicant any particulars of country information which it intends to rely on': see SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] . Accordingly no obligation arose under s 424AA in respect of this 'information' and the second ground was not made out. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 1701">23 In any event, the Minister submitted that no jurisdictional error arises. Section 424AA itself imposes no obligation upon the Tribunal. It provides an alternative means by which the Tribunal may give to the applicant 'information' that it is otherwise required to give in writing pursuant to s 424A(1) of the Act. A jurisdictional error will only arise if there is a breach of s 424A ( SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 at [23] --- [28], SZLWI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [17] --- [21], SZLQD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] ). There was no 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1) , and s 424AA was not engaged. I agree with these submissions.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 1572">The amended application contends that the Tribunal failed to comply with what is said to be a mandatory procedure prescribed by the Act, in failing to comply with s.424AA(b)(iv) of the Act. Section 424AA complements the Tribunal's obligations under s.424A. It does not impose a mandatory obligation on the Tribunal, insofar as that is contended for by the applicant. Rather, as indicated by Marshall J in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12], s.424AA enables the Tribunal, if it so chooses, to give to an applicant any information which the Tribunal considers would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review orally during the hearing. It does not compel the Tribunal to give an applicant any particulars of country information which it intends to rely on during the hearing. Moreover, if information is within the exceptions to s.424A , the statutory opportunity to put " information " orally under s.424AA rather than in writing under s.424A does not apply (see SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FMCA 1543">Ground one of the application relates to the same information and contends that the Tribunal failed to comply with s.424AA of the Act. However, the term " information " in s.424AA has the same meaning as in s.424A(1). (See SZLTC &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 384 and SZLYS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1397). Moreover, as Marshall J indicated in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] , s.424AA places no obligation on the Tribunal but enables it, if it so chooses, to give an applicant any information which the Tribunal considers would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review orally. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FMCA 1397">Moreover, as Justice Marshall indicated in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] s.424AA " places no obligation on the Tribunal but enables it, if it so chooses, to orally give to an applicant any information which the Tribunal considers would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. It does not compel the Tribunal to orally give an applicant any particulars of country information which it intends to rely on ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FMCA 1276">In my view, and with respect, the decision of Marshall J in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [15] , with its reference to the explanatory memorandum in the legislation, provides the key to understanding the operation of s.424AA. Once it is understood, as the explanatory memorandum says, that s.424AA complements the Tribunal's existing obligations under s.424A , it becomes clear why there is no equivalent to sub-s.424A(3)(a) and s.424AA. There does not need to be. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] FMCA 1237">The applicant's contentions in this respect do not establish jurisdictional error. Section 424AA does not impose an obligation on the Tribunal in the manner contended for by the applicant. Rather, as indicated by Marshall J in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 (at [12]): That section places no obligation on the Tribunal but enables it, if it so chooses, to orally give to an applicant any information which the Tribunal considers would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. It does not compel the Tribunal to orally give an applicant any particulars of country information which it intends to rely on. 
This was said to be apparent from the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill which introduced the section and is further elaborated on in SZMCD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1039. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FCA 1238">17 I wish to comment on an aspect of the Tribunal's decision that was not raised either in the judgment of the Federal Magistrate or in the appellant's grounds of appeal. It concerns s 424AA of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and was drawn to my attention by the first respondent's written submissions. The first respondent submitted that when the Tribunal put to the appellant that all the charges made in respect of the incident on 18 July 1997 were dismissed within six weeks, the Tribunal was proceeding under s 424AA of the Act. It was submitted that the Tribunal had complied with the section as it was interpreted in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] where Marshall J said:
 That section places no obligation on the Tribunal but enables it, if it so chooses, to orally give to an applicant any information which the Tribunal considers would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. It does not compel the Tribunal to orally give an applicant any particulars of country information which it intends to rely on. So much is apparent from that part of the explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill which introduced s 424AA where the following was said: 
 
 New section 424AA provides a new discretion for the RRT to orally give information and invite an applicant to comment on or respond to the information at the time that the applicant is appearing before the RRT in response to an invitation issued under section 425. This will complement the RRT's existing obligation under section 424A , in that, if the RRT does not orally give information and seek comments or a response from an applicant under section 424AA , it must do so in writing, under section 424A. The corollary is that if the RRT does give clear particulars of the information and seek comments or a response from an applicant under section 424AA , it is not required to give the particulars under section 424A. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FMCA 1172">His Honour noted two other cases which also considered, in part, the relationship between s.424AA and s.424A at [62]: "In SZLTC [v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 384] , Driver FM said at [16]: It appears from the terms of s.424AA that if the Tribunal elects to embark upon a course of oral disclosure at a hearing, there are resultant obligations as set out in s.424AA(b)(i)(ii)(iii) and (iv). It also appears that if the Tribunal embarks upon a course of disclosure under s.424AA it does not enjoy the protections in s.424A(3). In SZLQD [v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739] , Marshall J said of s.424AA at [12]: That section places no obligation on the Tribunal but enables it, if it so chooses, to orally give to an applicant any information which the Tribunal considers would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. It does not compel the Tribunal to orally give an applicant any particulars of country information which it intends to rely on. So much is apparent from that part of the explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill which introduced s.424AA where the following was said: 'New section 424AA provides a new discretion for the RRT to orally give information and invite an applicant to comment on or respond to the information at the time that the applicant is appearing before the RRT in response to an invitation issued under section 425.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2008] FMCA 1085">A useful account of the operation of s.424AA can be found in the decision of Marshall J in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. [5] </sentence>

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Application 
 The Applicant is a citizen of Nigeria who asks the Court to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on 3 rd April 2008, affirming the decision of a delegate of the Minister not to grant the Applicant a Protection (Class XA) visa.  Counsel for the Minister, Mr Kennett, submitted in respect of ground 1, that s.424AA is an adjunct to s.424A of the Act, and complying with s.424AA in relation to an item of information allows the Tribunal to rely on s.424A(2A) , thus excusing the Tribunal from compliance with s.424A(1) with respect to that information. Section 424AA(2) does impose additional pre-requisites to a valid decision which come into force if, but only if, the Tribunal seeks to act fairly by discussing adverse information with an applicant during a hearing. The only consequence of a breach of s.424AA is that the Tribunal cannot rely on s.424A(2A). Mr Kennett referred the Court to the decision of Marshall J in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [6] .  In my view, with the greatest of respect, the guide to understanding the operation of s.424AA can be found in the decision of Marshall J in SZLQD. At paragraph 12 of that decision, his Honour sets out the wording of s.424AA , saying: " Section 424AA , provides: If an applicant is appearing before the Tribunal because of an invitation under section 425: (a) the Tribunal may orally give to the applicant clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; and (b) if the Tribunal does so--the Tribunal must: (i) ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the applicant understands why the information is relevant to the review, and the consequences of the information being relied on in affirming the decision that is under review; and (ii) orally invite the applicant to comment on or respond to the information; and (iii) advise the applicant that he or she may seek additional time to comment on or respond to the information; and (iv) if the applicant seeks additional time to comment on or respond to the information--adjourn the review, if the Tribunal considers that the applicant reasonably needs additional time to comment on or respond to the information. " [10] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2008] FMCA 1039">Counsel for the Applicant referred the Court to the decision of Driver FM in SZLTC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [13] and also the decision of Marshall J in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [14] . In SZLTC, Driver FM noted that if the Tribunal embarks upon a course of oral disclosure at the hearing under s.424AA , there are resultant obligations in s.424AA(b). He also said: It also appears that if the Tribunal embarks upon a course of disclosure under s.424AA it does not enjoy the protections in s.424A(3). It would have been a simple matter for the Parliament to reproduce the exclusions in s.424A(3) in s.424AA. The fact that Parliament has chosen not to reproduce those exclusions lead me to think that they do not apply in relation to disclosure under s.424AA. [15]  NBKS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2006) 156 FCR 205 ; [2006] FCAFC 174 cited. SZEEU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2006) 150 FCR 214 ; [2006] FCAFC 2 cited. SZLTC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 384 cited
 SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 followed. Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1994] FCA 1253 ; (1994) 52 FCR 437 ; 124 ALR 265 ; 35 ALD 1 followed
 SZCBT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 cited. Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163 cited 
 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 cited
 SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 237 ALR 634 ; [2007] HCA 40 followed. There is an inconsistency between SZLTC and SZLQD. Driver FM said that "if the Tribunal embarks upon the course of disclosure under s.424AA it does not enjoy the protections in s.424A(3) " [31] . Marshall J said that s.424AA "does not compel the Tribunal to orally give an applicant any particulars of country information which it intends to rely on" [32] . With respect, the Court must follow the latter view. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2008] FMCA 991">Mr Potts submitted that, unlike s 424A , s 424AA does not impose any freestanding obligation on the Tribunal. If the Tribunal fails to comply with the requirements of s 424AA in a case in which it purports to give oral particulars at a hearing, the only consequence would conceivably be a breach of s 424A. He submitted that the alleged failure to comply with s 424AA , even if made out, would not constitute a jurisdictional error, relying on the decision of Marshall J in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [19] at [12]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] FMCA 978">I accept the submissions of the First Respondent as to the purpose of s.424AA as follows: " Ground 1 - failure to comply with section 424AA t; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;'"> 19. Section 424AA applies to review applications made after 29 June 2007, when the section commenced operation. This section provides a discretion [1] in the RRT to give oral particulars of information that would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review to the applicant orally at a section 425 hearing. 20. The legislative history of section 424AA demonstrates that this section was intended to provide a mechanism whereby the RRT could avoid the need to comply with section 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] FMCA 967">I agree with the Minister's submissions that s.424AA is permissive rather than mandatory [2] . There are obligations in s.424AA where the section is engaged, which I have dealt with previously [3] . In this case the section was not engaged. There is nothing in the record of what occurred at the hearing conducted by the Tribunal to indicate that the Tribunal embarked upon a course of oral disclosure pursuant to s.424AA. Neither was such a course of oral disclosure required in the circumstances of this matter. The need for such disclosure would, in my view, only arise for the purposes of s.424AA through the operation of s.424A(2A) or s. 425 . As there was no obligation to make written disclosure under s.424A there was no need to make oral disclosure as an alternative. </sentence>
