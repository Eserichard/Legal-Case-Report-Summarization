<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 47">Mr and Mrs Kocic also contend that allowing assessments on the basis of ordinary income would amount to double taxation as Ansetat has already been assessed on the undisclosed sales and the Commissioner has "collected his proportion of the tax debt from the liquidator's dividend". While the Commissioner can issue alternative assessments to different taxpayers on the same account he cannot recover from both. The debt is therefore said to be "discharged" and there is no utility in allowing the Commissioner to argue this issue. Mr and Mrs Kocic rely on Commissioner of Taxation v Grimaldi (No 9) (2009) 181 FCR 275 ; [2009] FCA 1404 to support this proposition. </sentence>
