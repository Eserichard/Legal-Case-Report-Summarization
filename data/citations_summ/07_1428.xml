<citphrase id="cp0.2" type=citing from="[2008] FCA 1706">was that to resist joinder allianz needed to demonstrate that the applicants' construction of the policy was so untenable that it should not be permitted to be argued. there was no occasion for me to express a concluded view as to whether allianz's or the applicants' submissions were correct. a reading of my reasons for judgment would, or might, convey to those untutored in what the issues on the application were that the question of the proper construction of the policy had been thereby resolved. that issue has not been resolved. all that has occurred is that i have held that allianz's argument that the applicants' construction is doomed to fail is itself without merit. the true construction will be determined at the trial in light of all of the evidence and submissions and not, as this application was, merely on a preliminary view of the material presently available.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1706">In Employers Reinsurance Corporation v Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 28 ; (2008) 166 FCR 398 a Full Court considered a claim by investors involved with an insolvent investment firm for a declaration that the firm's insurer was liable to it under the terms of a professional indemnity policy. No claim was made by the liquidator of the firm against the insurer. At first instance, French J had utilised O 6 r 2 to join the insurer: Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd v Knightsbridge Managed Funds Ltd (in lid) [2007] FCA 1428. On appeal the insurer argued that there was no "matter" in the requisite constitutional sense since the liquidator was not making the claim. Heerey, Sackville and Siopis JJ rejected this submission (at 411-412 [61]-[62]) and held (at 414 [73]-[74]) that the seeking of such a declaration and consequent joinder pursuant to O 6 r 2 was an appropriate exercise of discretion by the primary judge. It seems to me that similar reasoning applies in this case. The making of a declaration that Allianz is liable to Bentley Barton and Mr Taylor under the terms of the Policy and the presence of Allianz in any such suit will, effectively, resolve in the most efficient fashion, all of the issues between the parties. Accordingly, Allianz should be joined pursuant to O 6 r 2. </sentence>
