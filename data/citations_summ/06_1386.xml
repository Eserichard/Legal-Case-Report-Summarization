<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] WASC 251">38 The first consideration concerns the application of well established authorities on striking out pleadings as disclosing no reasonable cause of action or on the other grounds referred to in O 20 r 19 RSC. In particular, the principles identified by Master Staples in Kimberley Downs Pty Ltd v Western Australia (Unreported, WASC, Library No 6414, 25 August 1986) remain good law, although they no doubt fall to be applied according to the case management objectives enshrined in O 1 r 4A and r 4B; and see, for example, Kirika v Zurich Australian Insurance Ltd [2002] WASCA 233. In particular, O 20 r 19 is intended to only apply to cases that are not really arguable. In an application to strike out an action in defamation on the ground that the statements alleged were not defamatory of the plaintiff, the task of the court is only to decide whether it is open to the trier of fact to find that ordinary reasonable people would have understood the matter complained of in the defamatory sense pleaded: National Auto Glass Supplies (Australia) Pty Ltd v Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass (NSW) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1386 ; (2006) 156 FCR 148. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1625">Insofar as the applicant's case relies upon the assertion that the publications were defamatory, that, in the circumstances of this case, becomes a question of fact for me as the trial judge to determine. The question as to whether the publications were capable of giving rise to the defamatory imputations pleaded has already been addressed (see National Auto Glass Supplies (Australia) Pty Ltd v Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass (NSW) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1386 ; (2006) 156 FCR 148). </sentence>
