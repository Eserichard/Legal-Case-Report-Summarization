<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NNTTA 91">The Tribunal accepted that this was a relevant matter, considered the facts advanced by the native title party and made the following findings: 

'[55] Taking account of the allegations in the context of the evidence overall I cannot find that the grantee party has been so contemptuous of its obligations under the Aboriginal Heritage Act or existing agreements as to call into question the regularity of its future actions. I am satisfied that the grantee party is aware of its obligations under the Aboriginal Heritage Act , has entered into previous heritage agreements with the native title party and that the native title party have conducted site surveys pursuant to these in the past and are currently engaged with the grantee party in one related to E47/1237. '
 
 [51] The Tribunal's determination in Maitland Parker was subject to appeal and upheld by the Federal Court in Parker on behalf of The Martu Idja Banyjima People v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 1027 where Siopis J said: 

'10 The Tribunal went on to find that it was necessary to apply a predictive assessment as to whether the proposed future act was likely to give rise to the proscribed interference or disturbance. This involved taking into account the grantee party's intention in relation to the protection of Aboriginal heritage sites. In its reasons, the Tribunal drew a distinction between a "buffer zone" surrounding the site and the Barimunya site itself.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2011] NNTTA 16">In the present matter, an RSHA also does not apply as the tenement is in the Kimberley region, and I have come to the conclusion that there are sites of significance within the proposed licence area, notwithstanding that the evidence of the native title party may be imprecise as to the location of those sites. [51] Each inquiry is presented with evidence which needs to be carefully and discretely evaluated. Whilst the operation of the site protection regime renders it unlikely that the doing of the future act will result in interference with areas or sites of particular significance, the Tribunal is not absolved from undertaking its own risk assessment ( Parker v Western Australia [2007] FCA 1027 at [13] and [18] per Siopis J).

He found that there was a likelihood of interference with sites of particular significance to the native title party.
