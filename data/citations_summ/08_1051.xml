<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 455">At the outset, I should indicate that O 62 r 4(2)(c) is expressed in general terms and is not limited to only complex and protracted litigation. Even in very simple cases a gross sum assessment may be appropriate: see Ginos Engineers Pty Ltd v AutoDesk Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1051 ; (2008) 249 ALR 371 per Finn J at [22]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 392">When the power conferred by O 62 r 4(2)(c) is exercised, the task undertaken by the Court is thus " one of estimation or assessment and not of arithmetic calculation or precision ": Nine Films &amp; Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2006] FCA 1046 at [8] . Tamberlin J there further observed that the rule " contemplates the application of a much broader brush than that applied on taxation. The approach must be logical, fair and reasonable ". Although a " broader brush " may be applied, the discretion to make a lump sum order --- no less than the general discretion to order costs --- " must be exercised judicially and in accordance with principle ": Ginos Engineers Pty Ltd v Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1051 at [23] , [2008] FCA 1051 ; 249 ALR 371 at 377 per Finn J. By way of example, in circumstances where a party did not oppose fixing costs in the sum of $183,000, but where the Court was not prepared to assess costs in that amount, an order was made for the payment of costs fixed in the sum of $70,000: Moss v Insurance Australia Ltd [2005] FCA 87 per Jacobson J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 14">In the context of negotiations between the parties to resolve the copyright infringement issues, GE filed proceedings against Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd on 6 August 2007 in the Adelaide Registry of the Federal Magistrates Court (ADG 219 of 2007) seeking a declaration as to the amount of damages it was liable to pay Autodesk Australia. The proceedings were dismissed on Autodesk's application. A separate costs argument was held because GE opposed costs which were awarded to Autodesk Australia and sought payment of its own costs. Federal Magistrate Simpson awarded Autodesk Australia its costs: Ginos Engineers Pty Ltd v Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 2156. An appeal against that decision was dismissed by the Federal Court: Ginos Engineers Pty Ltd v Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1051. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1686">171 In Gedeon v Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] FCA 1051 ; (2008) 249 ALR 371 the High Court addressed what it referred to as 'fragmentation of the criminal process'. At [23] a Full Bench of the High Court comprising Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said:
 '23 With respect to the exercise of the power to make the declaratory orders now sought by the applicants, authority in this Court affirms an important general principle. This is that power to make declaratory orders should be exercised sparingly where the declaration would touch the conduct of criminal proceedings. The fragmentation of the criminal process is to be actively discouraged. ...' (Footnote omitted) </sentence>
