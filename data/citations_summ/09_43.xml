<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 42">Two days ago, Finkelstein J handed down reasons for judgment in Phisci Pty Ltd v Green Frog Nominees Pty Ltd (In liq) (No 3) [2009] FCA 43. His Honour granted leave to proceed against OPSL essentially upon the ground that the claim is to recover the applicant's own property. His Honour limited the grant of leave to issues of liability only.  I do not propose to list the details of those proceedings. Leave to proceed against OPSL appears to has been given in the matters of Panopus PLC v Opes Prime StockBroking Limited (Receivers and Managers appointed) (Administrators appointed) (Supreme Court of Victoria proceeding 5835 of 2008); Asia Pacific Links Limited v Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited &amp; Ors (Federal Court of Australia proceeding NSD 878 of 2008); and Phisci Pty Ltd v Green Frog Nominees Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 3) [2009] FCA 43. There are a number of other proceedings where leave has been sought but not yet granted. The proceedings involve more than 100 claimants and include a number of class actions. Client Creditors of OPSL
