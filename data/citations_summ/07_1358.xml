<citphrase id="cp2.11" type=cited from="[1984] FCA 6">social security act 1947 (cth), s. 135m(1). the applicant was in receipt of an invalid pension for being incapacitated for work by reason of a back ailment. the applicant declined to undergo surgery, in the form of a lumbar laminectomy which might have cured the ailment because he feared the operation. the respondent cancelled the pension. the applicant appealed to the administrative appeals tribunal which found the refusal to undergo surgery, objectively regarded, as unreasonable. thus the tribunal confirmed the decision of the respondent to cancel the pension pursuant to s. 135m(1) of the social security act 1947 (cth). the applicant appealed to the federal court.  held: (1) that while the applicant suffered from the back ailment he was permanently incapacitated for work within the meaning of s. 23 of the act.  (2) section 135m(1) of the act confers a discretion on the director-general to cancel or suspend a pension of a person; such discretion to be exercised having regard to the age and the mental and physical capacity of that person and to the facilities available to that person for suitable treatment for physical rehabilitation and suitable training for a vocation.  (3) that when s. 135m(1) refers to the director-general having regard to "the facilities available to that person for suitable treatment for physical rehabilitation and suitable training for a vocation" it does not refer to the general physical rehabilitation of an ailment; it is limited to rehabilitation for a contemplated vocation.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] AATA 335">I note that she has not filled the script for medication for her stress. Previous decisions of the Tribunal have held that a claimant's failure to follow treatment recommendations made by treating medical advisers can preclude a finding that their condition has been "fully treated": eg Re Tlonan and Secretary, Department of Social Security (1997) 24 AAR 467 (failure to take migraine medication). I accept though that, having regard to her sensitivities due to her thyroid problem and her history of stomach problems with some medication, that she is legitimately concerned about side effects. I accept too that she doubts the long term benefits of such medication: Jansen v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1358. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 220">29. Because Derryn has a long history of non-compliance and distrust of doctors as a feature of his condition, it is far from clear that he would comply with optimal recommended intervention in any event. In Jansen v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1358 , the Federal Court stated at paragraph 23 that:
 
 
 
 ... "generally" persons will wish to pursue reasonable treatment but, exceptionally, there may be circumstance when such persons do not, ie where (i) significant functional improvement is not expected, (ii) there is a medical reason for the person not undergoing further treatment, or (iii) there is "other compelling reason" for the person not undergoing medical treatment. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 15">In the decision of Heerey J in Jansen v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1358 his Honour applied the reasoning of Smithers J in Dragojlovic to the text of Schedule 1B of the 1991 Act (both Dragojlovic and Koutsakis referred to provisions in the Social Security Act 1947 ) and said that the test in respect of a person refusing to undergo reasonable treatment in the context of obtaining a pension was not an objective test that requires the person show some reason or fact external to his or her decision but: 
 
 On the contrary, the emphasis is on subjective good faith, or lack thereof, in the person's decision, however irrational it may seem. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCAFC 48">1 On 27 April 2006 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal rejected Mr Bernard Jansen's application for a disability support pension basically because he refused to undergo treatment for the conditions responsible for his disability. On 7 September 2007 a judge of this Court ordered that Mr Jansen be granted an extension of time to lodge his appeal, that the appeal be heard instanter and allowed and that the matter be remitted to the Tribunal, differently constituted. This is an appeal from his Honour's decision [2007] FCA 1358. On 22 February 2008, the respondent filed a notice of contention, however at the hearing the respondent elected not to press the issues raised in the notice. It must therefore be formally dismissed without further comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] AATA 2004">In Jansen v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1358 , the Federal Court stated at paragraph 23 that: 
 
 "generally" persons will wish to pursue reasonable treatment but, exceptionally, there may be circumstance when such persons do not, ie where (i) significant functional improvement is not expected, (ii) there is a medical reason for the person not undergoing further treatment, or (iii) there is "other compelling reason" for the person not undergoing medical treatment.
