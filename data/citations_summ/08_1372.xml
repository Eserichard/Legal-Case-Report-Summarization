<citphrase id="cp22.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 1006">Mr Kumar submits that the exercise of this power by the Tribunal was so unreasonable that no reasonable Tribunal would have exercised it It is submitted that the Tribunal did not make any further attempt to obtain the information: Wecker v Secretary, Department of Education, Science and Training [2008] FCAFC 108 at [110] ; SZIAI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 at [19] .  Mr Kumar acknowledges that there may not be a general duty on the Tribunal to make enquiries. However, there are limited circumstances which render a decision invalid for failure to enquire. Mr Kumar submits that in undertaking a review of the delegate's decision, the Tribunal in this instance "was bound to make its own enquiries and form its own views" about the application being made: Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at [26] ; further discussed in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 at [18] . The fact that Mr Singh was asserting that he did have a Certificate IV was readily discernable: SZIAI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 at [29] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 269">Apart from the assertion that the Tribunal failed to investigate the applicants' claims of persecution in India, the applicants have not particularised or made submissions identifying which of their claims the Tribunal failed to investigate. Having regard to the fact that the Tribunal only had before it the facts, as alleged by the applicant husband, that were contained in the papers, it is the only material upon which the Tribunal could proceed. The relevant facts pertaining to the application need to be supplied themselves, in as much detail as necessary to enable the applicant to establish the facts. It is for the applicant to make out his own case: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo Wei Rong (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 596 per Kirby J. In this case, the Applicant had an opportunity to attend the hearing and furnish additional facts. To the extent that he did, the applicant could not complain that any other facts were not taken into account or furnished additional facts and asked them to be taken into account. The Tribunal is under no general duty to make its own enquiries: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32. The Tribunal's decision record reveals the contrary and disclosed that the applicant's claims were closely considered and there was nothing evident from those reasons which would have compelled the Tribunal to make any further enquiry: SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 340">The federal magistrate also rejected the appellant's third ground. At [61]-[62], his Honour held that there was no evidence that the information to which that ground related was readily available.

His Honour distinguished the judgment of Flick J in SZIAI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 (2008) 104 ALD 22 , a case in which a simple phone call may have been all that was required.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 1196">In initial written submissions the first respondent had acknowledged that " on present authorities" a decision may be held to be unreasonable and thereby affected by jurisdictional error if the decision-maker failed to inquire into material that was readily available and centrally relevant to the decision to be made, irrespective of whether sufficient evidence already existed (see Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 ; (1985) 65 ALR 549 and SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 104 ALD 22 ; [2008] FCA 1372). It was contended however that this was not such a case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCAFC 153">43 Referring to SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 104 ALD 22 ; [2008] FCA 1372 his Honour concluded (at [35]) that:
 In my view, and consistently with the decision of the Federal Court in SZIAI, it was unreasonable in the exceptional circumstances of this case for the Tribunal not to make a further enquiry. I am bound by that decision. Information was readily available to the Tribunal that no designated security was available at the relevant time into which the applicant could make the required deposit. That information was centrally relevant to the decision and was of immediate relevance to both the timing of the decision and the appropriate power to be exercised by the Tribunal in the circumstances.  46 As noted, the Federal Magistrate (at [35]) considered the decision in SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 104 ALD 22 ; [2008] FCA 1372 to be binding on him (as, indeed, it was at the time of his decision). The Federal Magistrate also considered (again at [35]) that the decision of the Federal Court in SZIAI required a finding that, on the facts of the present case, the Tribunal's failure to make inquiries about the availability of a designated security for the purpose of the making of a deposit was unreasonable in the sense required so as to amount to jurisdictional error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 954">The submission is that, to the extent that the Tribunal's decision failed to attribute any weight to the evidence of that witness as a result of weighing up that evidence against the adverse credibility findings, the failure to inquire was unreasonable in the sense that no reasonable decision maker in the circumstances would have proceeded to make the decision as it did without having made that inquiry at the hearing (see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [21] at [63]; SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [22] ). It was further submitted that this failure to inquire involves a failure to comply with s.425(1) of the Act, being a failure to afford a proper opportunity to provide evidence on the issues the Tribunal considered were arising from the review ( SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [23] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 945">On what is before the Court, there is nothing to suggest that there were any of the "strictly limited" circumstances which would compel the Tribunal to make further inquiries ( Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 at 33; (1985) 6 FCR at 169 --- 170 per Wilcox J; see also SZIAI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 at [19] per Flick J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] HCA 39">Flick J correctly eschewed any suggestion that the power of the Tribunal to make inquiries imposed upon it any duty or obligation to do so [9] . However he also said that "jurisdictional error may be exposed by a failure to inquire and that such a failure may render a decision manifestly unreasonable" [10] . The circumstances in which a Tribunal decision would be set aside on such grounds might be "a confined category of case" [11] .
  An application for judicial review was dismissed by the Federal Magistrates Court on 18 June 2008 [7] . SZIAI appealed to the Federal Court. On 8 September 2008, Flick J ordered that the appeal be allowed, the orders made in the Federal Magistrates Court be set aside, the decision of the Tribunal be quashed and the matter be remitted to the Tribunal to be determined according to law [8] . Special leave to appeal against his decision was granted by this Court on 13 February 2009. It was granted upon the undertaking by the Minister that he would not seek to displace the costs orders in favour of SZIAI in the Federal Court and that he would bear the reasonable costs of SZIAI of this appeal, including the costs of the special leave application. 
  Flick J correctly eschewed any suggestion that the power of the Tribunal to make inquiries imposed upon it any duty or obligation to do so [9] . However he also said that "jurisdictional error may be exposed by a failure to inquire and that such a failure may render a decision manifestly unreasonable" [10] . The circumstances in which a Tribunal decision would be set aside on such grounds might be "a confined category of case" [11] .
  That does not, however, impose upon it a general duty to undertake its own inquiries in addition to information provided to it by the applicant and otherwise under the Act [4] . In this case the Federal Court, on appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court, quashed a decision of the Tribunal on the erroneous basis that it had committed jurisdictional error by unreasonably failing to undertake its own inquiries into certain matters. Those matters related to the authenticity of documents, provided by the applicant for review, which had been impugned by third party information of which the applicant had been given notice, and to which he had replied in writing [5] . The Minister's appeal against the decision of the Federal Court must be allowed. A contention that the Tribunal had a duty to invite the applicant for review to an additional hearing to deal with the third party information is rejected. His Honour was evidently satisfied that the case before him fell within such a category. The authenticity of the certificates had been placed in issue by the information which the Tribunal had obtained from the Association. The issue to which they were directed was "centrally relevant to the decision reached". He held with "considerable reservation" that the Tribunal should have made an inquiry of the authors of the certificates [12] . He concluded that the Federal Magistrates Court had erred in not holding that the Tribunal's decision was vitiated by reason of its failure to make inquiries. 
  Flick J correctly eschewed any suggestion that the power of the Tribunal to make inquiries imposed upon it any duty or obligation to do so [9] .

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 825">It was further submitted that the duty to make further inquiries arose in this case because the Tribunal was seized of diametrically opposed information regarding the genuineness of the letter from Mr Hossain in circumstances where the basis for concluding that the letter was not genuine was not disclosed to the applicant or readily discernable (see SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [23] at [29]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 828">In support of his contention, Mr Zipser referred the Court to SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 (" SZIAI ") in support of the proposition that it was unreasonable in the circumstances for the Tribunal to fail to make enquiries of the authors of all the letters to check authenticity of the witness statements ( Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 242 ALR 455 ; SZIAI ). </sentence>

It was entitled to act on the material presented by the appellant ... ". It has, however, further been recognised that a failure on the part of the Tribunal to make inquiries may constitute jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 at [60] to [63], 161 FCR 151 at 172 to 174 per Kenny J.

<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FMCA 674">Further, counsel for the Applicant submitted that the Tribunal could easily have obtained a copy of Ms Lu's application for a protection visa to verify her claim and its failure to make this simple inquiry was Wednesbury unreasonable, giving rise to jurisdictional error ( Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [20] at [63]; SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [21] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FMCA 709">I accept that in dealing with jurisdictional error in relation to the code of procedure within the Migration Act the Court must look to that code of procedure and not the general law in order to answer the relevant question. In SZIAI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1372 the Federal Court found error by the Tribunal in failing to inquire about a particular issue. That case leaves open the question of whether that failure may be material both in relation to the Tribunal's review generally and, at least hypothetically, in relation to a particular aspect of the code of procedure under the Migration Act . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FMCA 590">In Dhanoa, Driver FM found that the Tribunal had fallen into jurisdictional error by failing to inquire of the Minister's Department what the situation was regarding the making of deposits into designated securities and followed Flick J in SZIAI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1372 ; (2008) 104 ALD 22 in concluding that such a failure to inquire could in rare circumstances constitute a jurisdictional error. Driver FM came to the view that the necessary circumstances existed in this case saying at [35]: "In my view, and consistently with the decision of the Federal Court in SZIAI , it was unreasonable in the exceptional circumstances of this case for the Tribunal not to make a further enquiry. I am bound by that decision. Information was readily available to the Tribunal that no designated security was available at the relevant time into which the applicant could make the required deposit. That information was centrally relevant to the decision and was of immediate relevance to both the timing of the decision and the appropriate power to be exercised by the Tribunal in the circumstances.

I note that that decision is subject to appeal in the High Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] FCA 576">Further, in relation to a claim by the appellant that the Tribunal failed to initiate inquiries in Bangladesh regarding the authenticity of the two letters, his Honour could not identify any basis for bringing the proceedings before the Tribunal within the exceptional cases where such a duty can arise, comparing the proceedings before him to those in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le and Others [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [77] ; SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2007) 164 FCR 14 at [59]- [60]; and SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 ; (2008) 104 ALD 22 and citing SZICU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 1 ; (2008) 100 ALD 1 at [29] and Wecker v Secretary, Department of Education, Science and Training [2008] FCAFC 108 ; (2008) 168 FCR 272 at [110] in favour of his contention. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2009] FCA 622">She characterised the case as "rare and exceptional", and the inquiries which she thought were required as "not difficult to make and straightforward" (see [77] --- [79]).

However, all the authorities have emphasised that the obligation to initiate inquiries is exceptional, and arises from some special circumstance in the procedures followed by the Tribunal, in which there is "readily available and centrally important" information which it is obviously reasonable to expect the Tribunal to obtain (cf. SZICU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 1 at [29] ).</sentence>

To the extent that relevant material has been in the possession of the Department (provided it is directly relevant to the decision to be made), courts have found that it is incumbent on the tribunal to make appropriate enquiries (for example, see Minister for Immigration v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 ; (2007) 242 ALR 455 ; (2007) 97 ALD 112 ; Burton v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1464 and SZIAI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1372 ; (2008) 104 ALD 22). </sentence>

Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ there observed at 71: 
 It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case.

 It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial. If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish.

<sentence id="cs22" from="[2009] FMCA 392">There is no general obligation on the Tribunal to investigate claims made or conduct enquiries. Ultimately, it is for an applicant to satisfy the tribunal that he meets the criteria required for being a refugee. This is not a case where there is obvious material available to the Tribunal that was centrally relevant to its decision and to which it failed to have regard, nor is it a case in which the authenticity of specific documents submitted by the First Applicant were in issue ( SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 ; (2008) 104 ALD 22). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2009] FMCA 343">In relation to the contention that the Tribunal should have made contact with the doctor, I accept the submission of counsel for the Minister. He referred to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 , where at [19], [43] and [124], their Honours emphasised that the Tribunal has no general duty to obtain medical evidence through its own inquiries, in circumstances which have some similarity with the present. In the present case, there was no special circumstance which would give rise to any such duty (compare: Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [77] , SZJBA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 at [59] - [60], SZIAI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 [Special leave granted 13-2-09], SZICU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 1 at [29] , and Wrecker v Secretary, DEST [2008] FCAFC 108 ; (2008) 168 FCR 272 at [110] ). I can therefore detect no error, whether jurisdictional or otherwise, in relation to the Tribunal's consideration of the applicant's claims about her mental state and the letter from Dr Zhu. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2009] FMCA 268">The applicant's references to Pestell's case and Prasad's case are obscure. This is not a case where it is reasonably arguable that there was any obvious inquiry required to be taken by the Tribunal which was not taken (compare Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [77] , SZJBA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 at [59] - [60], and SZIAI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 [Special leave granted 13-02-09], with SZICU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 1 at [29], and Wecker v Secretary, Department of Education, Science and Training [2008] FCAFC 108 ; (2008) 168 FCR 272 at [110] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2009] RRTA 275">It was submitted that organisation G has not responded to the questions raised by the applicant and the Tribunal "has to wait for a response, or to make the enquiries that have been raised by the applicant as material to her case". It was submitted that the Tribunal "has an obligation to make those further enquiries or to ask [organisation G] to provide answers to our letter" The applicant's representative then quoted at length from the judgement of Flick J in SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 at [26] to [29] Information from other Sources

<sentence id="cs26" from="[2009] FMCA 171">I also reject the fifth ground of review. First, while the applicants might have been prejudiced by the Tribunal's failure to contact the person identified after the hearing as the person who took the applicants' mother to Afghanistan, that is addressed adequately in relation to the issue of discretion. There was, in my view, no obligation on the Tribunal to telephone an unnamed person who may or may not have been the same person who allegedly took the applicants' mother's body to Afghanistan. In that regard, this case is distinguishable from SZAIA v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1372 where the person to be contacted was a known person and where it was apparent that the additional information likely to be obtained could be determinative. Further, no additional hearing had been requested and an approach by telephone in the absence of a hearing would have been problematic in terms of the Tribunal's obligations under s.359. The Tribunal had not been given an address at which it might communicate with the person in writing.  This is his telephone number ... No information was provided regarding the identity of the individual, where the individual lived, or what his precise role was with respect to transportation of the mother's body. Having regard to the Tribunal's concerns regarding inconsistencies in the applicants' evidence and reliance upon fake documents, it was entirely reasonable for the Tribunal not to call this number in order to speak with an individual whose identity was unknown and who had not previously provided a statement to the Tribunal. For these reasons, the case is distinguishable from SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 ; (2008) 104 ALD 22 (special leave granted, [2009] HCATrans 28) , and no jurisdictional error has been demonstrated. Particular (iv): The Applicant claims that the Tribunal ought to have made enquiries to DFAT to determine the meaning of DFAT's response to the Tribunal's follow-up request on 14 July 2008 and to find out whether the requests were actually made. There was no reason for the Tribunal to believe that DFAT had not responded properly to its request of 14 July 2008 and no issue of critical importance to which any such enquiries would have related. In relation to ground 5, the applicant notes that the decision of the Federal Court in SZIAI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1372 is the subject of an appeal to the High Court. In the meantime, I am bound by the decision and the applicant relies in particular upon the reasons of his Honour Flick J at [26]-[29]. The applicant relevantly submits: The Tribunal also had a duty to enquire of DFAT whether it made the request ... to the Ali Abad Hospital in Hazara Town, Quetta and Afghanistan's Consulate General in Quetta asked of it by the Tribunal on 14 July 2008, how the request was made and what the response actually was. That statement did not confirm that the requests were actually made. The Tribunal failed to make a telephone call to a person that the Applicant stated took his mother's body to Afghanistan, when the number was provided to the Tribunal for that purpose (CB150, CB156). The circumstances are on par with those in SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 at [26] to [29], per Flick J. The Tribunal was aware that the information related to a critical issue, being the death of the Applicant's mother, and it also knew that the information was readily available, or ought to have so known. In those circumstances, it had to make the enquiries set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2009] FMCA 248">In relation to the Tribunal's failure to initiate inquiries in Bangladesh, I can identify no basis for bringing the present situation within the exceptional cases where a duty can arise (compare Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [77] , SZJBA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 at [59] - [60], and SZIAI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 [Special leave granted 13-2-09], with SZICU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 1 at [29] , and Wrecker v Secretary, DEST (2008) 168 FCR 272 at [110]) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2009] FCA 79"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2009] FMCA 44">Kenny J held in that case that the Tribunal should have inquired into the qualifications of an interpreter at a Departmental interview, whose interpretation of a critical admission was called into question. She characterised the case as "rare or exceptional" , and the inquiries which she thought were required as "not difficult to make" and "straightforward" (see [77]-[79]). Similar conclusions have been reached in other recent cases (cf. SZJBA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 at [59] - [60], and SZIAI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 at [29] ). However, all the authorities have emphasised that the obligation to initiate inquiries is exceptional, and arises from some special circumstance in the procedures followed by the Tribunal, in which there is "readily available and centrally important" information which it is obviously reasonable to expect the Tribunal to obtain (cf. SZICU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 1 at [29] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs30" from="[2009] FCA 2">31 Counsel for the appellant relied upon the judgment of Flick J in SZIAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1372 ; (2008) 104 ALD 22. In that matter, the applicant for a protection visa had provided two "certifications", from persons residing overseas, in support of his claim that he had changed his religious faith. Each such document provided an address and mobile telephone number.</sentence>
