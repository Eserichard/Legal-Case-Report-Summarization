<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1586">59 In Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 3) [2006] FCA 397 ; (2006) 230 ALR 528 Merkel J considered principles relevant to the question of penalty for contempt, citing from his earlier reasons in Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCAFC 89">33 In order to illustrate further why we disagree with the primary judge's ultimate conclusion on this issue it is necessary to return to the circumstances in which the fine was imposed by the Full Court. Merkel J was satisfied that, by dealing with money in bank accounts contrary to the orders made, in the first instance, by Sundberg J the appellant committed contempt which 'involved deliberate defiance of the Sundberg J orders and constituted a criminal contempt'. He said ( Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 3) [2006] FCA 397 at [10] ):
 ... because the disposal contempts were disguised steps calculated to defeat, and which in part defeated, the purpose of the Sundberg J orders, they amount to particularly serious contempts. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCAFC 90">8 Merkel J in his reasons for judgment said ( Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 3) [2006] FCA 397 at [12] ): 
 There is no evidence that Siminton has any capacity to pay a fine and the interlocutory orders made in the proceeding prevent him from accessing any of the funds upon which he might otherwise lawfully draw upon to pay any fine. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 1814">13 The following passage from Merkel J's sentencing remarks in Siminton (No 3) is relevant for present purposes:
 
 "The court has a broad discretion as to penalty. Having regard to the factors set out above [those noted at [15] of these reasons] and the matters put forward by counsel on behalf of Siminton, the appropriate term of imprisonment for the disposal contempt is 10 weeks. I would add that had there been any prior contempt convictions, the penalty would have been significantly greater. I am not prepared to accede to Siminton's submission that any sentence of imprisonment should be suspended. " 

See Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 3) [2006] FCA 397 ; (2006) 230 ALR 528 at 532.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1609">6 On 10 April 2006 Merkel J ordered that Mr Siminton be imprisoned in respect of the various contempts: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No. 3) [2006] FCA 397 ; (2006) 230 ALR 528. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1612">2 On 29 December 2005, 4 January 2006 and on 19 January 2006 APRA filed notices of motion and statements of charge seeking orders that Mr Siminton be punished for contempt in respect of nine alleged breaches of the orders made by Sundberg J. On 30 March 2006 Merkel J found six of those charges proven. He described them collectively as "the disposal contempts". In sentencing Mr Siminton for these contempts Merkel J summarised Mr Siminton's conduct as follows:
 
 "On the evidence before the court, it is clear that Siminton's disposal contempts were of an extremely serious kind and constituted wilful disobedience and contumacious disregard of the court's orders. The seriousness of the breaches is underlined by the fact that Siminton's conduct was precisely the kind of conduct against which Sundberg J sought to guard by the making of the orders the subject of the contempt charges. The conduct involved the actual transfer of large sums of money ($536,880.18, $38,000, $43,000, $5,000 and $10,000 respectively), and an attempted cash withdrawal from a Bendigo Bank account of $500,000, all of which occurred shortly after Siminton became aware of the Sundberg J orders. " 

See: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 3) [2006] FCA 397 ; (2006) 230 ALR 528 at 529. On 10 April 2006 Merkel J ordered that Mr Siminton be imprisoned for a period of 10 weeks in respect of the disposal contempts. </sentence>

 116 It was submitted that the judge erred in failing to consider whether it was appropriate to order that the sentence be suspended and it was urged in support of the view that it should be that Mr Charitopoulos had acted on 2 May 2006 in the belief that the orders of 4 April 2006 did not prevent Haritopoulos from distraining for rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] VSC 15">
 
 34 Merkel J again acknowledged in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No. 2) , that "the distinction between civil and criminal contempt has lost much of its significance". [10] His Honour recognised, however, that the distinction might be relevant to penalty. A contempt involving deliberate defiance would be criminal, and "disguised steps calculated to defeat ... the purpose" of a Court order, could render it particularly serious. [11] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2006] FCA 695">

61 In oral submissions, counsel for Mr Spencer tendered an apology in similarly reserved and conditional terms. I consider that Mr Spencer has not shown any remorse for the fact that he wilfully disobeyed the Orders. Indeed, he has not acknowledged that he is in contempt of court. Through his counsel, Mr Spencer expressed his wish to 'rectify any remaining problems with his compliance with the orders. ' In evidence, Mr Spencer added that he would 'rectify any and all points that the Court... says that I have not complied with in the orders. ' I do not regard Mr Spencer's statement as one that affords any indication of regret, remorse or contrition about his contempt: it is merely an offer to do what Mr Spencer is in any event obliged to do under the Orders: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Simiton (No 3) [2006] FCA 397 at [14] - [15]; ACCC v INFO4PC at 57-58 [155].</sentence>
