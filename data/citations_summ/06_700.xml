<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 17">Again, the case had an element of public protection. The sentence was effectively suspended for two years, on condition of compliance with the orders and the payment of fines. The next highest sentence was nine months, imposed in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Reid (No 2) [2006] FCA 700 for two breaches of an order prohibiting Mr Reid from managing a corporation. But for Siminton and the two Reid cases, no sentence of imprisonment for longer than six months has ever been imposed by the Court for contempt of court.  I would not disturb the costs order made in the Court below. I would not make any order as to the costs of the appeal particularly as the appellant has succeeded, in part at least, by reference to an argument which was not put in the Court below. I certify that the preceding seventy-six (76) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko. Associate:

It is unnecessary for me to consider this question because of the factual findings I have made that Mr Levi has failed to establish his claim that he is indigent. </sentence>
