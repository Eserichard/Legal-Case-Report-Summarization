<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1105">By application filed on 7 August 2009, the applicants ( Schutz ) sought and obtained ex parte orders to restrain VIP from engaging in the practice of cross-bottling Composite IBCs in Australia ( Schutz DSL (Australia) Pty Ltd (ACN 009 069 907) v VIP Plastic Packaging Pty Ltd (ACN 095 313 705) [2009] FCA 1049 ( Schutz 1 ) (at [31])); on 19 August 2009, the ex parte orders were discharged on the basis that the balance of convenience did not favour their continuation. On 27 August 2009, VIP gave the undertaking to the Court. When the undertaking was given, VIP's certification under the Dangerous Goods legislation did not specify approval to sell particular cross-bottled 15.5 kilogram bottles manufactured under licence of Mauser-Maschinentechnik GmbH ( Mauser ) in a Schutz cage. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1137">Orders 2 and 3 will not be repeated. These reasons are required because the parties have been unable to agree as to the precise form of orders flowing from the earlier judgment ( Schutz DSL (Australia) Pty Ltd (ACN 009 069 907) v VIP Plastic Packaging Pty Ltd (ACN 095 313 705) [2009] FCA 1049).
