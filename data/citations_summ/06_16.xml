<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 209">In VBAM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCA 504 at [44] Gray J said: 
 "The evidence of the three witnesses was information that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application. " 

 
His Honour did not refer to the terms of s 426 when arriving at that conclusion. That decision was followed by Gordon J in SZIAT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 766 at [39] . She also referred to Bennett J's decision in SZAQI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1653 at [23] - [24]. There, Bennett J again referred to the concept of an applicant calling a witness to give oral evidence on his or her behalf as being within the scope of s 424A(3)(b). Bennett J distinguished the contrary construction by Branson J in SZECG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 733 at [17] - [22]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 836">14 It is worth noting that in Beyazkilinc v Manager Baxter Immigration Reception &amp; Processing Centre [2006] FCA 16 , Mr Beyazkilinc sought interlocutory relief against his removal from Australia and Mansfield J made an order that the Commonwealth of Australia be restrained from removing him until further order. His Honour's judgment in that case was not appealed.</sentence>
