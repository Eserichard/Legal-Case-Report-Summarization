<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 106">72 It has been held that an inadequate standard of interpretation may interfere with the right of an applicant to present a case to the RRT to such a degree that jurisdictional error has occurred (see e.g. Perera v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 507 ; (1999) 92 FCR 6 ; WACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; (2003) 131 FCR 511 ( "WACO" )). Occasionally such an allegation upon examination sustains a conclusion that there has been a failure to afford the hearing which s 425 of the Act guarantees (see e.g. M175 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1212). But the opposite conclusion may also be available (see e.g. Mazhar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1759 ; (2000) 183 ALR 188 at [39] , WACO at [63]-[69], SZKLX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1414 at [12] ). Regardless of the outcome of different cases arising from different factual circumstances, however, the discussion in those cases reveals no real difference of principle. </sentence>
