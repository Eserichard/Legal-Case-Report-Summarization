<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 466">The concept of "the public interest" is notoriously difficult to define. There is, first, a distinction to be drawn between the public interest and a matter of interest to the public: see for example Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith [1991] VicRp 6 ; [1991] 1 VR 63 at 73-4. The relevant interest is the interest of the public generally as distinct from the interest of an individual or individuals: Smith ibid. Sometimes these distinct interests will coincide: see for example Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 211 at 228. Often there will be competing public interests which must be brought into account. In a context, such as the present, there will often be a public interest in seeking to ensure the lawfulness of determinations made by the executive government and a public interest in giving effect to the principles, identified by McHugh J in Oshlack (above at [2]), especially where public funds are involved.  As the terms "ordinary rule" and "usual order" imply they constitute guidelines to inform the exercise of a broad and unfettered judicial discretion: see Latoudis v Casey at 541 (Mason CJ), 557 (Dawson J). A Court will not decline to award costs against a successful party unless justice so requires having regard to the "facts connected with or leading up to the litigation": Latoudis at 557 (Dawson J). See also Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234 [9] (Black CJ and French J). There is no general exception to the ordinary "rule" in cases in which environmental issues are raised or, more generally, "public interest" issues are involved: see Oshlack at 75 (Brennan CJ); 84, 91 (Gaudron and Gummow JJ), 91-2, 98-100 (McHugh J); South-West Forest Defence Foundation Inc v Executive Director of Department of Conservation and Land Management (No 2) (1998) 154 ALR 411 at 412 (Kirby J); Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 81 ALR 166 at 171 (Burchett J). That is not to say that public interest considerations may not, in a particular case, support a departure from the "ordinary rule": Ruddock at 236 [14]; Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 211 at 227-8 (Heerey J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 330">It is in s 132 that the phrase "an informed decision" appears. The context in which it appears is important. As already noted s 132 provides a discretionary power, pursuant to which the Minister may request additional information before making a decision under s 133. He can seek such information if he forms the subjective opinion that he does not have sufficient information to make an informed decision. Even if he forms this opinion, he is not required, by s 132, to instigate further enquiries. As Heerey J observed in Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 211 at 227 [66] : 
 "Thus, the power (which is expressed in discretionary, non-obligatory terms) to request information depends, not on objective assessment of the sufficiency of the information before the Federal Minister, but on the Federal Minister's judgement (no doubt reasonably formed) as to whether he or she has enough information to make an informed decision. As to the difficulty of making out a legal challenge to decisions made under such powers: see Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 at 118-9, and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 275-277. " 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 200">9 Second, " there is no special costs regime applicable to 'public interest' litigation ": Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth [2006] FCAFC 51 at [6] , [2006] FCAFC 51 ; 230 ALR 411 at 413 per Black CJ, Moore and Emmett JJ. Similarly, in rejecting a broadly expressed submission as to " public interest litigation ", Gummow J (when sitting as a Judge of this Court), has observed that " there are no special categories which control the general discretion given by s 43 ": Council of the Municipality of Botany v Secretary, Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (1992) 34 FCR 412 at 416. But a legitimate public interest in the importance of the issues resolved is a factor that may be taken into account when exercising the discretion conferred by s 43. Instances can be provided where the public interest has been a factor relied upon in not making an order for costs (eg, Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 8 at [68] ---[75] [2008] FCA 8 ; , 165 FCR 211 at 227---8) or in making an order confining costs to only part of the costs otherwise payable (eg, Wilderness Society Inc v Minister for Environment and Water Resources [2008] FCAFC 19 , 101 ALD 1) ; instances can also be provided where such a factor has not prevailed (eg, Your Water Your Say Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage &amp; the Arts (No 2) [2008] FCA 900). Some of the authorities relevant to a discretionary power to order the payment of costs and the public interest, it may be noted, have been usefully collated and discussed by Professor Campbell in ' Public Interest Costs Orders ' [1998] AdelLawRw 20 ; (1998) 20 Adel L Rev 245. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1106">4 The applicant also relied upon the decision of Heerey J in Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage &amp; the Arts (2008) 165 FCR 211 ; [2008] FCA 8. In dealing with a different legal challenge to the same project which was the subject of these proceedings, his Honour said at [73]:
 In my view, however, this is a clear case for the application of the Oshlack approach. The condition of Port Philip Bay is a matter of high public concern, and not only for the four million or so Victorians who live around it. As might be expected, the Project has attracted much controversy. On Saturdays the Melbourne Age publishes a list of which it considers to be the "Five Big Issues" of the week. Last Saturday, 12 January, Port Philip Bay channel deepening was third, topped only by Andrew Symonds in the Sydney Test and Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire. Although, as has been said in another context, there is a difference between what is in the public interest and what is of interest to the public... in the present case the two happen to coincide. There is a public interest in the Approval Decision itself, and equally in whether it has been reached according to law. Also, the application raised novel questions of general importance as to the approval process under the Environment Act...  10 It follows that this case can be distinguished from Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage &amp; the Arts [2008] FCA 8 , decided by Heerey J, in that no novel point of construction or matter of particular importance in the administration of the statute had to be determined. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] VSC 204">64 It remains to mention some points made by counsel for the Attorney-General concerning cl 11(3) of Schedule 2 which requires that a process be described as such and not as a cause or a symptom of a process. First, it was difficult to know what it means. She submitted that it could only mean that the process had to be described in terms of both cause and effect. I would be disposed to accept that submission. Secondly, she submitted that cl 11(3) pertained to the description of the process in a nomination but not to the description of the process in a final recommendation. On that basis the identification of a process in a final recommendation would not be restricted by cl 11(3), even if narrowly construed. Thirdly, she submitted that it is doubtful whether cl 11(3) can be called in aid in the construction of the word "process" in the Act, as the earlier form of the Regulations which included cl 11(3) was not made contemporaneously with the Act but in 1999 three years after the Act came into force; see Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [6] . In the absence of developed argument on these points, and it being unnecessary to do so in view of the conclusions I have already reached, I do not undertake consideration of them. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 900">3 Recently I declined to make an order for costs against an unsuccessful party in litigation raising environmental issues: Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 211 at [73] . The present case, however, is not comparable. Unlike Blue Wedges , the present case did not raise any novel questions of general importance about the operation of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) or any difficult questions of construction. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCAFC 19">1 On 22 November 2007 this Court ordered, Tamberlin J dissenting, that this appeal be dismissed (see [2007] FCAFC 175 ; 98 ALD 512). At the request of the appellant the costs order additionally pronounced on that day was revoked and directions made for the filing and service of written submissions on costs. Following the publication by Heerey J of his Honour's reasons for judgment in Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 8 the parties were invited to file and serve supplementary written submissions on the issue of costs.
