<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 265">In respect of the submission that Ms Carr's affidavit refers to documents, entitling them to production of them, the applicants refer to observations by Heerey J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries [2006] FCA 136 at 33, where his Honour said: 
 In contrast to discovery under O 15 rr 1, 5 or 8, production under O 15 r 10 does not depend on any leave being given by the Court. The reason is obvious enough. When a document is directly relied on by an opposing party, basic procedural fairness would require that a party be able to inspect the document, if only to see whether it is what it is alleged to be. 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 195">Order 15 r 10 is intended to give the opposite party the same advantage, with respect to documents referred to in pleadings or an affidavit, as if the documents were set out in the pleading or affidavit: Quilter v Heatly (1883) 23 Ch D 42 at 50 per Lindley LJ. This is a requirement of basic procedural fairness: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Visy Industries [2006] FCA 136 at [33] per Heerey J. </sentence>
