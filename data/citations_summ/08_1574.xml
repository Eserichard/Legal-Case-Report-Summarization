<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 349">Neither in NW Frozen Foods [1996] FCA 1134 ; 71 FCR 285 nor in Mobil Oil [2004] FCAFC 72 ; [2004] ATPR 41-993 did the Full Court expand on the meaning of the phrase "permissible range". I consider that the phrase refers to a range which would be permitted by the Court, that is, a range within which the penalty is neither manifestly inadequate nor manifestly excessive. " See also, for example, Standen v Feehan (No 2) [2008] FCA 1574 ; (2008) 177 IR 276 at [10] - [12] ; Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Merhis Constructions Pty Ltd (2010) 199 IR 308 at [6]. 6. The question of the appropriate penalty to be imposed is ultimately a matter for the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 102">Although the parties have agreed upon the orders the court should make and the penalties that it should impose, the court must nonetheless exercise its own discretion and fix what it considers to be the appropriate penalties: Standen v Feehan (No.2) [2008] FCA 1574 ; (2008) 177 IR 276 at [8] --- [13] applying NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 290-291 and Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1382">When imposing a penalty for contraventions of Part XA of the Workplace Relations Act pursuant to s 298U in Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 , 94 IR 231 (" Coal and Allied "), Branson J made the following observations as to some of the considerations to be taken into account: 
 
 [8] The following matters, which are not intended to comprise an exhaustive list, seem to me to be considerations to which the Court may appropriately have regard in determining whether particular conduct calls for the imposition of a penalty, and assuming that it does, the amount of the penalty: 
 (a) The circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place (including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act). (b) Whether the respondent has previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of Pt XA of the Act. (c) Where more than one contravention of Pt XA is involved, whether the various contraventions are properly seen as distinct or whether they arise out of the one course of conduct. (d) The consequences of the conduct found to be in contravention of Pt XA of the Act. (e) The need, in the circumstances, for the protection of industrial freedom of association. (f) The need, in the circumstances, for deterrence. 
 

 
These principles have since been applied when assessing penalties under other provisions of the Act: e.g., Standen v Feehan (No 2) [2008] FCA 1574 at [14] , 177 IR 276 at 278 to 279 per Lander J. See also: Automotive, Foods, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union v Thornton Engineering Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1584 at [21] , 191 IR 315 per North J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 865">So far as Part 15 of the Act is concerned the only penalty proceeding involving a contravention of the right of entry provisions is Standen v Feehan [2008] FCA 1009 ; (2008) 175 IR 297 per Lander J (as to the contravening conduct) and [2008] FCA 1574 ; (2008) 177 IR 276 (as to the penalty decision). Mr Feehan was an official of the CFMEU although the CFMEU was not a party to the proceeding. Mr Feehan in exercising powers of entry to premises under ss 285B and 285C of the Act intentionally hindered and obstructed a person in contravention of s 285E of the Act. A penalty of $1,300.00 was imposed on Mr Feehan. The maximum penalty was $2,000.00. As to questions of broader principle, Lander J considered at [16] of the penalty decision that punishment played some part in formulating a penalty for a contravention of the right of entry provisions but rehabilitation played no real part. Lander J was dealing with the imposition of a penalty on the individuals. </sentence>
