<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 37">33 Both before the primary judge and on the appeal the appellant relied upon a decision of the Court of Appeal in England in Association of British Travel Agents Ltd v British Airways plc [2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 204 , which it claimed was determinative of the contractual claim. The primary judge described the decision as "underpinning the applicant's contractual claim": Leonie's Travel [2009] FCA 280 ; 255 ALR 89 at [34] . For that reason, he dealt with this authority at the outset. We shall adopt the same approach. As the citation shows, the decision of the Court of Appeal was given nearly four years before IATA published the presently relevant version of its Travel Agents Handbook. The appellant contended that the decision of the Court of Appeal was again determinative on the issues raised on the appeal and the issue raised in Qantas' notice of contention. 1 This is an appeal from an order of a judge of this Court dismissing the appellant's claim for damages for breach of contract: Leonie's Travel Pty Ltd v International Air Transport Association [2009] FCA 280 ; (2009) 255 ALR 89. </sentence>
