<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 1782">7. In NAJO v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 356 , Moore J said at [24]: 
 
 
 "The Tribunal member was plainly sceptical of the appellant's claims and took a fairly vigorous approach in testing them. However, this falls well short of establishing that the Tribunal approached its consideration of the appellant's claims of a closed mind. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] NSWSC 133">3 On 19 January 2007, McDougall J made orders under s.411(1) for the convening of a meeting of the members of the plaintiff for the purpose of considering the proposed scheme of arrangement. His Honour subsequently delivered reasons for making those orders: Re Green's Foods Limited [2007] NSWSC 43. Those reasons touched upon the principal matters to be considered upon such an application. His Honour noted in particular the arrangements that had been made or were proposed to deal with the "credit risk" or "performance risk" issue which had been the subject of comment in a number of recent cases, in particular the decision of Gyles J in Re Tempo Services Limited [2005] FCA 410 ; (2005) 53 ACSR 523 (see also Re Tribeca Learning Ltd [2006] FCA 356 (Jacobson J); Re Webcentral Group Ltd [2006] FCA 937 (Lindgren J); Re Promina Group Ltd [2006] FCA 1772 (Gyles J)). McDougall J noted the joint trust account provision that had been adopted to ensure that members of the plaintiff were not at risk as to the unavailability of the funds that would become due to them for their shares. </sentence>
