<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 47">In defending the primary judge's findings that the 1979 and 1981 recordings of Down Under reproduce a substantial part of the musical work Kookaburra, Larrikin relied upon the decision of the Full Court in Metricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Limited [2008] FCA 712 ; (2008) 248 ALR 364 where the Full Court referred with approval to the reasons of Weinberg J in Eagle Homes Pty Limited v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 87 FCR 415 at [119] including a statement by his Honour which in the words of the Full Court at [20]: 
 
 ... characterised the questions of whether or not a particular drawing reproduces another drawing, or a substantial part of another drawing, as questions involving matters of impression and degree with the consequence that an appeal court would not depart from the finding of a primary judge without being persuaded that it was erroneous in principle, or plainly and obviously wrong ...

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 246">On appeal from, inter alia , Gilmour J's holding that Metricon had reproduced a substantial part (identified as the alfresco quadrant) of the plan for the Seattle house, the Full Federal Court stated in Metricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 712 ; (2008) 75 IPR 455 (at [42]-[43]): 
 
 
 It is trite that the dominant principle of copyright law is that protection is given, not for ideas, but only for the form of expression. ... Copyright cannot subsist in the idea of a house with an alfresco quadrant to the side of the back portion of the house. However, copyright can subsist in a plan that reflects that idea for a house. Whether it does or not will depend on whether the plan is an original artistic work within the meaning of s 32(1) of the Act. The plan will be an original artistic work in the statutory sense if it is recognisably the author's own work as opposed to a copy of another's work or a trivial variation on another's work... 
 
 

 
 
 
 In this case the Metricon Parties conceded that copyright subsists in the Copyright Works. They thereby conceded that the Copyright Works were original artistic works within the meaning of s 32(1) of the Act. Their reliance on evidence which tended to show that the arrangement of a rumpus, family, kitchen and meals room around a courtyard or patio to the side of a home was commonplace in the industry sits uncomfortably with this concession.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 185">In Metricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd , the Full Federal Court (Branson, Sundberg &amp; Kenny JJ) identified three questions which the primary judge in that case [should have] considered. Those questions were: "(a) to identify the work in suit in which copyright subsists; (b) to identify in the alleged infringing work the part taken (that is, derived or copied) from the work in suit; and (c) to determine whether the part taken constitutes a substantial part of the work in suit.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 29">The passage from the judgment of Gibbs CJ in S. W. Hart , in which his Honour encapsulated the notion of reproduction into the elements of objective similarity and causal connection, has been applied in this Court on many occasions: see eg Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 78 ; (2004) 61 IPR 378 at [43] ; Inform Design and Construction Pty Ltd v Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 912 ; (2008) 77 IPR 523 at [60] ; Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (ACN 005 108 752) v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd (ACN 088 015 267) [2008] FCAFC 46 ; [2008] FCA 712 ; (2008) 248 ALR 364 (" Metricon Homes v Barrett ") at [64]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCAFC 156">77 It is to be remembered that the task of the Court on an appeal by way of rehearing on the evidence that was before the primary Judge is the correction of error: see ss 24(1)(a) and 27 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [75]; Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at [22] - [25] per Allsop J, with whom Drummond and Mansfield JJ agreed; Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 ; (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [20] - [31]; CSR Ltd v Della Maddalena [2006] HCA 1 ; (2006) 224 ALR 1 at [16] - [24]. In Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 87 FCR 415 at [113] - [119], Weinberg J explained why a primary Judge's finding of fact on the issue of similarity should be accorded the utmost respect and not departed from unless the appellate court is persuaded that the finding was erroneous in principle or plainly and obviously wrong. His Honour's observations were approved by a Full Court of this Court in Metricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 712 ; (2008) 248 ALR 364 at [20] . 43 It is convenient, at this stage, to refer to our role as a Full Court. It was recently considered by another Full Court in a case which is substantially the same as the present: Metricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 712 ; (2008) 248 ALR 364. In a considered joint judgment the Full Court referred to a number of earlier Full Court authorities addressing this question, namely S &amp; I Publishing Pty Ltd v Australia Surf Life Saver Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 316 ; (1998) 88 FCR 354 ; Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 and Poulet Frais Pty Ltd v The Silver Fox Company Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 131 ; (2005) 220 ALR 211. After setting out a passage from the judgment of Allsop J in Branir ([24]-[25]), the Full Court said at [20]:
 The applicability of the observations of Allsop J in Branir to appeals of the present kind is confirmed by reference to the earlier Full Court decision in Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 87 FCR 415 and, in particular, the observations made by Weinberg J at [113]-[125]. At [114] Weinberg J, citing Biogen Inc v Medeva Plc [1996] UKHL 18 ; [1997] RPC 1 at 45, described the question of whether or not a particular drawing is sufficiently similar to another to amount to a reproduction of it, or a reproduction of a substantial part of it, as "a kind of jury question" so that a finding on the question "should be treated with appropriate respect by an appellate court". At [119] his Honour characterised the questions of whether or not a particular drawing reproduces another drawing, or a substantial part of another drawing, as questions involving matters of impression and degree with the consequence that an appeal court would not depart from the finding of a primary judge without being persuaded that it was erroneous in principle, or plainly and obviously wrong: see also per Lindgren J, with whom Finkelstein J agreed, at [108). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCAFC 31">8 The respondents previously brought a proceeding seeking to protect their copyright in that part of the Seattle house plan and the Memphis house plan comprising the al fresco quadrant. The principal respondent to that proceeding was Metricon Homes Pty Ltd ("Metricon"). Metricon designed, built and sold residential project homes in Victoria, and one of its house plans and houses was called the Streeton. The Streeton is referred to later in these reasons. The respondents were successful before Gilmour J and an appeal to the Full Court of this Court was dismissed: Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1509 ; (2007) 74 IPR 52 ; Metricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 712 ; (2008) 248 ALR 364.

 (1) to identify the work in suit in which copyright subsists; 
 
 (2) to identify in the alleged infringing work the part taken (ie derived or copied) from the work in suit; and
 (3) to determine whether the part taken constitutes a substantial part of the work in suit.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1220">20 It is clear from SBRF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 712 that the quashing of a decision of the Tribunal does not render a s 425 invitation ineffectual (at [25]); and that it does not follow from the invalidity of a Tribunal decision that all steps and procedures taken in arriving at that invalid decision are themselves invalid (at 24]). In this context, I accept the first respondent's submission that:
 At the first hearing, the appellant was informed that his entire story was liable to be disbelieved and, when he came to the second hearing before the Tribunal, he should have been under no illusion that the issues before the Tribunal remained only the matters which were of concern to the delegate. He knew that his credibility was liable to be disbelieved and, accordingly, that he needed to prove all of this claims as best he could. </sentence>
