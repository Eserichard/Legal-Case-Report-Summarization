<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 303">As Counsel for the Respondents submitted, not only did JL Holdings not support the granting of the adjournment in the circumstances of the present proceeding but there is a vast body of authority in this Court where applications for adjournments have been refused where the Applicant for the adjournment was in a far better position than the current Applicant: for example, in Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 102 at [13] - [20] per Finkelstein J (giving the judgment of the Court on the grounds of the application) an application for adjournment was refused where there was evidence of lack of funds and lack of necessary documentation to prosecute the appeal. See also AMI Australia Holdings Pty Ltd v Bade Medical Institute (Aust) Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1783 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1628 ; Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd v Elderslie Finance Corporation Ltd [2008] FCA 1045 ; Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 1179 ; Vescio v Hon Kristina Keneally [2008] FCA 589 ; Westpac Banking Corporation v Tsatsoulis [2003] FCA 406. By way of contrast, an adjournment was granted in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 920 , where substantial evidence was led that thousands of pages of documents were provided to the Applicant on the eve of the trial as annexures to affidavits in circumstances where the Applicant could not reasonably have read these documents or be certain that relevant discovery had been completed. That is a long way removed from this case: see [22] to [26] above. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1556">The applicants have submitted that these costs should be paid on the standard basis, namely party to party. 2. Liability for costs related to the orders of 18 July 2006 ( Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 920) and the directions hearing of 21 July 2006. 3. Release of the cheque of $150,000 and bank guarantee of $75,000 provided by the first and third applicants as security for the respondents' costs. 21 The proximate reason for the adjournment of the trial on 18 July 2006 was, as I explained in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 920 , the inability of the applicants to properly consider additional witness statements totalling some 3785 pages in length, delivered over 10 days in the lead up to the scheduled commencement of the trial. While I note the late completion of Mr Robertson's expert reports, there is, in the absence of evidence, no basis for the respondents' claim (in considerable hindsight) that the absence of those reports meant that the applicants were not in a position to prove their case had the hearing proceeded as scheduled on 17 July 2006. The practical effect of the vacation of the trial dates was that both applicants and respondents were able to file, at later dates, supplementary evidence including further expert reports as permitted by my orders of 9 August 2006. Indeed I also note that, in accordance with my orders of 9 August 2006, the respondents filed considerable additional evidence upon which they relied at trial, including an affidavit of Mr Burns (filed 28 July 2006), affidavits of Mr Strahley (filed 11 August 2006 and 18 August 2006), and affidavits of Mr Harrison, Mr Breed and Mr Bailey (filed 18 August 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1672">3 This application for security for costs comes in the context of a dispute which has been the subject of multiple applications during the course of 2006 including adjournment of the original date of the trial ( Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 920) , a recent unsuccessful application for security for costs brought by the respondents ( Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1498) , and delays because of extensive objections to evidence (some of which have not yet been determined). As a result of developments including extensive and complex argument concerning objections to evidence of witnesses of the applicants, the non-appearance of a key witness for the applicants and foreshadowed amendment to his evidence, and other unforeseen complications during the course of the two weeks of the trial (which re-commenced 13 November 2006 following the adjournment in July 2006), the hearing of the matter was not completed during the time allocated.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 1001">The immediate history of this matter is set out in (2006) FCA 920. The hearing of the substantive case was scheduled to commence on Monday 17 July 2006 for two weeks. On the application of the applicants I adjourned the hearing of this matter for reasons including that a considerable volume of material was put before the applicants in the days before the trial. </sentence>
