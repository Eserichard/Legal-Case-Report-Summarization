<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 929"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1149">Mr Felman submits that the question of whether a CoE is required by .222 to be current at the date of decision depends on: Whether the validity of a CoE depends on it being current, and If so, is the currency assessed at the date of the Minister's decision. 
Mr Felman referred to the decision in Quarm v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1156 ; (2008) 171 FCR 307 at [207] as authority that by virtue of s.65 of the Act, the criteria referred to are those in force at the time the Minister makes the decision. The Court accepts that submission.  The Court refers to the Explanatory Memorandum of Statutory Rules 2001 No 162 that includes the following statement: The purpose of new subclause 572.222 is to ensure that an applicant provides evidence that he or she is enrolled, by producing a certificate of enrolment, in a full-time course of study or training that is not a suspended education provider. (emphasis added) 
.222 is a time of decision requirement, to "ensure that the applicant provides evidence that he or she is enrolled...in a full-time course of study" (emphasis added). Section 65 provides for the Minister to grant a visa, if satisfied that the criteria for a visa are met. The criteria referred to are those in force when the Minister makes his decision Quarm v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Anor [2008] FCA 1156 ; (2008) 171 FCR 307 at [27] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 916">(4) In particular, it cannot be sufficient (or even relevant) to point out that a criterion may result in rejection of a visa because of circumstances over which the applicant has no control and that the results may be harsh. For example, an annual quota might be fixed for visas of a particular class; the quota for a year might be fixed at zero; or a class of visas might be abolished altogether. Amendments which doom a visa application to failure may validly be made after the application is lodged: Quarm [2008] FCA 1156 ; (2008) 171 FCR 307. (5) These examples serve as a reminder that s 31(3) deliberately leaves the formulation of immigration policies (and thus visa criteria) to the executive government. The formulation of such policies takes place in the political realm, in the national interest as it is perceived from time to time, and the sanctions for adopting unwise or unfair policies are political. The Minister made three submissions in response: 
(1) First, if the construction advanced by the appellant led to the invalidity of the clause, that would be an overwhelming reason not to adopt it: Legislative Instruments Act 2003 (Cth), s 13(1)(c) ; Airservices Australia v Canadian Airlines International Limited (2000) 202 CLR 133 at [229] and [408]; as to statutes generally see Residual Assco Group Ltd v Spalvins [2000] HCA 33 ; (2000) 202 CLR 629 at [28] . Similarly, if the consequences of a particular construction include absurdity, that construction is to be avoided: Quarm v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1156 ; (2008) 171 FCR 307 at [17] ; Airservices Australia at [229] --- [232] and [408] --- [414]; Public Transport Commission (NSW) v J Murray-Moore (NSW) Pty Ltd [1975] HCA 28 ; [1975] HCA 28 ; (1975) 132 CLR 336 at 350; Widgee Shire Council v Bonney [1907] HCA 11 ; (1907) 4 CLR 977 at 983. The alternative construction, giving 'evidence' a more confined meaning, is clearly an available one. It is not necessary to label a provision as 'ambiguous' before entertaining alternative constructions of it: e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 223">A criterion which operated in that way would not have the effects which, so the Applicant contends, lead to invalidity. Construction of cl 880.224 Assuming for the moment that the operation attributed to cl 880.224 by the Applicant is properly labelled as absurd and/or invalid, ordinary principles of construction require the clause to be construed so as not to have that operation, if such a construction is open. [5] Further, as cases on the modern approach to statutory construction illustrate, it is not necessary to characterise a provision as ambiguous in order to entertain alternative constructions of it. [6] Clause 880.224 may be construed, without doing any violence to its language, as requiring the absence of evidence, considered persuasive by the decision-maker that the information referred to was false or misleading. A construction along these lines is the preferable one.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 1393">The decisions in Sun and Quarm were that the application in each case would be dismissed. The application in this matter was adjourned to 1 st October 2008 to await the decision in the appeal Quarm v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Anor. On 22 nd August 2008 Sundberg J gave judgment in that matter, dismissing the appeal. [9] </sentence>
