<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 704">The Commission notes that in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v European City Guide SL [2009] FCA 1206 , Moore J approved West and gave the Commission the opportunity to amend the originating process to delete a claim for relief where a prima facie case had not been made out and then granted leave to serve out of the jurisdiction. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1429">And, when considering whether an Applicant has made out a " prima facie case ", the kind of evidence adduced need only be " in proportion to the nature of such an interlocutory issue ": WSGAL Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 510 ; (1992) 39 FCR 472 at 476 per Beaumont J. As the requirement is imposed at the outset of proceedings, it does not require the kind of scrutiny that would occur (for example) in a submission of " no case to answer " following the closure of an applicant's case at trial: Merpro Montassa Ltd v Conoco Speciality Productions Inc [1991] FCA 70 ; (1991) 28 FCR 387 (" Merpro ") at 390. It may be appropriate to draw inferences more readily in favour of an applicant, bearing in mind that the applicant will not have had the advantage of discovery, subpoena and other procedural aids to the making out of a " prima facie case ": Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd (In liq) (Receiver and Manager Appointed) (1991) 30 FCR 102 (" Vetter Trittler ") at 110 per French J, citing Merpro . This " threshold requirement " of a " prima facie case ... is met where material is placed before the Court from which inferences are open which, if translated into findings of fact, would support the relief claimed ": Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v European City Guide SL [2009] FCA 1206 at [4] per Moore J, applying Vetter Trittler. But " [a]ctual evidence rather than mere allegations are required ": Applecross Pte Ltd v Lim [2009] FCA 1102 at [6] per McKerracher J. </sentence>
