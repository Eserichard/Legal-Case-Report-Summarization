<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 643">The Tribunal did not breach section 426A of the Act. That section confers a discretion upon the Tribunal to exercise its statutory powers in one of two ways, assuming the conditions in sections 426A(1)(a) and (b) are first met. The preconditions to the exercise of the section 426A discretion were satisfied and the Tribunal elected to make a decision on the review without rescheduling the applicant's appearance before it. This does not constitute jurisdictional error ( SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1295 ; (2006) 155 FCR 159 at 55). Furthermore, as stated in the first respondent's submissions, it has been recognised that the discretion conferred by section 426A is a wide one ( MZXTA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1201 at 71, affirmed on appeal in MZXTA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1186 ; (2009) 112 ALD 89). </sentence>

 The MRT is generally under no duty to use its permissive statutory powers: see WAGJ of 2002 v MIMA [2002] FCAFC 277 at [21] , [24]-[25]. The MRT is also not required to give reasons for its exercise of discretion: SZHSQ v MIMA [2006] FCA 1295. But in any event, the first respondent contents that the MRT did in fact provide reasons as to why it decided to not adjourn. In the Full Federal Court decision in Huo v MIMA [2002] FCAFC 383 , which upheld a decision of Conti J in Huo v MIMA [2002] FCA 617 , the applicant complained that the MRT should have waited for a related decision.</sentence>

His Honour reiterated that: An administrative decision which involves jurisdictional error is regarded in law as no decision at all": Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506 [76] citing Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597 at 614-615 [51] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 618 [63] McHugh and at 646-647 [152] per Hayne J. </sentence>

SZEZI has been applied, for example, SZFWZ v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 263 per Edmonds J at [14]; SZCIC v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1194 per Ryan J at [29]; SZHZB v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 547 per Stone J at [8]. Notwithstanding that some doubts were expressed by Rares J in SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1295 , at [40 - 44], at [45] his Honour did say:
 
"Although my mind has wavered on the point, I am of the opinion that the better view is that the Tribunal's use of the failure of the appellant to give evidence is to be viewed in a similar fashion. At the end of the day, the Tribunal concluded that, on the very limited information available, it was not satisfied that the appellant would be at risk of persecution were she to return to China or that there was any real chance that she would be persecuted if she did. Notwithstanding my doubts, I find that the Tribunal was not obliged to give notice under s.424A(1) and that I should dismiss this ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 626">It is correct to say that Rares J in SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1295 , shed some doubt on the views expressed by Allsop J above, but his Honour did conclude in the end at [45] that the Tribunal was not obliged to give a notice under s.424(1). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 498">Counsel for the Applicant then took the Court to various authorities that had applied the principles in Bhardwaj ( SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1295 per Rares J at [59]; SZIMG v Minister for immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 368 per Rares J at [24]; Keen v Telstra Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 834 ; (2006) 230 ALR 313 per Rares J at [29]; Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No.2) [2007] FCA 1684 per Rares J at [115]). However, none of these cases raised the issue before this Court of the legal effect of a decision affected by error where, upon judicial review of the decision of the administrative body, Constitutional writ relief was refused. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 126">As a matter of good administration, where an applicant does not appear at a hearing and has not responded to a hearing invitation but has provided a telephone number for use by the Tribunal, it is, in my view, desirable for the Tribunal to seek to contact the applicant in order to clarify the circumstances. That is not, however, a legal obligation. I am bound by the decision of Rares J in SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1295. His Honour deals with this issue between [46] and [68]. In that case the applicant had responded to the hearing invitation stating that she wished to appear and provided a telephone number. Rares J found no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal not attempting to contact the applicant by telephone to enquire about her non-attendance. In this case, the applicant had not responded to the hearing invitation, and there would have been even less of an incentive for the Tribunal to make the attempt. While, as Rares J notes, many and possibly most decision makers would make an attempt to contact an applicant by telephone in circumstances of non-attendance where a telephone number was provided, there is no jurisdictional error in failing to make that attempt where an applicant has been invited to attend by one of the means prescribed and has failed to respond or attend. It was open to the Tribunal to proceed in the applicant's absence pursuant to the discretion conferred by s. 426A and no jurisdictional error arises because of the failure of the Tribunal to telephone the applicant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FMCA 2109">The Tribunal invited the applicants to a hearing pursuant to s.425. This invitation was not returned to the Tribunal as undeliverable or unclaimed. On what is before the Court now, the Tribunal complied with its obligations pursuant to ss.425 and 425A . The invitation was sent to the applicants' mailing address as notified by them (CB 51 to CB 56), and the invitation complied with the requirements set out in s.425A. As the first respondent submitted, the Tribunal complied with its statutory obligations in this regard and did not need to take further steps to contact the applicants. (See Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC (2006) 231 ALR 630 ; [2006] FCAFC 73 (" SZFHC ") at [39], and SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Affairs [2006] FCA 1295 (" SZHSQ "), a matter on appeal from this Court in the Federal Court. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCA 1613">30 In this case the Tribunal exercised its discretion under s 426(1) and made its decision without taking any further action to allow or enable the appellant to appear before it. In SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1295 at [57] Rares J said: 
 
 'The seriousness of the possibility that a consequence of a decision to proceed to affirm a decision under s 426A(1) that the persecution feared could be suffered is in my opinion part of the subject matter, scope and purpose of the legislation and conditions the way in which the discretion in s 426A(1) falls to be exercised. ' 
 

I respectfully agree. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FMCA 1868">15. As submitted for the respondent and on the basis of the material before me, including that affidavit, I am satisfied that the invitation to hearing dated 7 September 2005 was addressed and sent to the address for correspondence provided by the applicant in her review application by registered post on 7 September 2005 and that in that way the Tribunal met its obligations in relation to a s.425 invitation under s.425A , having regard to s.441A and the requirements of reg 4.35D. Having complied with its statutory obligations there was no obligation on the Tribunal to take any further steps to attempt to contact the applicant (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC [2006] FCAFC 73 and SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1295). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2007] FMCA 1745">23. The Tribunal, in its findings and reasons, indicated that a reason for decision was that the applicant was unable to explain the circumstances surrounding her arrest and detention and to specify the nature of the demonstration. This indicates that the Tribunal was not able to reach a state of satisfaction in relation to the applicant's claims: SZEOP at [24]; SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1295 at [42] - [43] per Rares J; SZEZI v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 1195 at [29] per Allsop J. This is not a case where the relevance to the review of the information is stated generally rather than specifically nor is it a case where the information is relevant to the decision in a manner not stated by the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2007] FCA 1213">22 Furthermore s 426A(1) of the Act clearly empowered the Tribunal to make a decision on the review because the two requirements in the section had been met namely, a valid invitation had been issued and the applicant for review did not appear at the appointed hearing: SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1295 at [55] . </sentence>
