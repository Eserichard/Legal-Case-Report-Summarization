<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 49">The following general propositions can be stated as to the analysis required to establish the relevant counterfactual: Objective prediction
 
 (1) The focus of s 177C is the identification of an activity --- the prediction of events that would have or might reasonably have expected to have taken place in the absence of the scheme: Trail Bros at [47]; AXA Asia Pacific Holdings at [131]. (2) In the case of a deduction, s 177C(1)(b) provides that it is an objective inquiry as to what would have been allowed or might reasonably be expected to have been allowed as a deduction had the scheme not been entered into or carried out: Epov v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 34 ; (2007) 65 ATR 399 at [62] ; Peabody at 385 --- 386; Trail Bros at [24]. It is an objective fact whether a taxpayer obtained a tax benefit in relation to a scheme to which Pt IVA applies: Peabody at 382; Hart at [37]; Trail Bro s at [23]; AXA Asia Pacific Holdings at [126]. (3) When predicting the events which would or might have taken place, that question is assessed on the assumption that the scheme had not been entered into or carried out: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lenzo [2008] FCAFC 50 ; (2008) 167 FCR 255 at [121] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 134">145 Finally, the Commissioner submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to consider the "putative purpose" of the scheme. The submission is without foundation and must be rejected. First, there was no factual finding by the trial judge that the "putative purpose" of the scheme was to attract the benefit of the scrip-for-scrip roll-over relief. Secondly, Counsel for the Commissioner conceded that this submission contradicted his earlier submission concerning the use of subjective evidence (see [139] and [140] above). As a result, the Commissioner stated that this was an alternative submission. Looking to the "putative purpose" of the scheme is not something contemplated by s 177C(1)(a) and is contrary to the notion that the inquiry be one based on objective fact: Epov [2007] FCA 34 ; 65 ATR 399 at [62] and Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; 181 CLR 359 at 385-6. 127 In the case of an amount being included in the assessable income of a taxpayer, s 177C(1)(a) provides that it is an objective inquiry as to what would have been included or might reasonably be expected to have been included in the assessable income had the "scheme" not been entered into or carried out: Epov v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 34 ; (2007) 65 ATR 399 at [62] and Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; 181 CLR 359 at 385-6. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 94">24 In the case of a deduction, s 177C(1)(b) provides that it is an objective inquiry as to what would have been allowed or might reasonably be expected to have been allowed as a deduction had the "scheme" not been entered into or carried out: Epov v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 34 ; (2007) 65 ATR 399 at [62] and Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; 181 CLR 359 at 385 --- 386. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 37">17 The applicant submits that it is quite clear that it did not get a "GST benefit" from any scheme that has been or might be identified. An entity only gets a GST benefit if the amount of GST payable by it is, or could reasonably be expected to be, smaller than it would be apart from the scheme or a part of the scheme (s 165-10(1)(a)). That requires adopting a hypothesis as to what would have occurred had the scheme not been entered into. It is submitted that the hypothesis must be reasonable and based upon the evidence ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; (1994) 181 CLR 359 at 385; Epov v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 34 ; (2007) 65 ATR 399 at 412). It is submitted for the applicant that no such hypothesis has been or could be adopted here.</sentence>
