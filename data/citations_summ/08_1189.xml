<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 15">The primary judge dismissed North East Equity's application ( North East Equity Pty Ltd v Proud Nominees Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1189). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 700">Proud Nominees and Mr Proud had successfully used their knowledge, skill and experience to procure and supervise the installation of the new line so that it performed as they had represented it would (or which North East Equity had failed to prove did not so perform): my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [128]. When the representations were made, Mr Proud, as the controlling mind and principal of Proud Nominees, had had years of experience in recommending equipment of the kind in the new line to his customers and arranging with the suppliers to procure and install the equipment so that it would operate, and be reasonably fit for, the purpose for which it was installed. He was familiar with the nature and quality of his suppliers' products and had recently been involved in procuring and supervising the installation of a similar, but not identical, plant for Kalfresh in Queensland. Here, the proof of the pudding was in the eating, since the new line was and operated, in the respects on which North East Equity sued, in accordance with, or had not been proved to depart from, the representations.  I found that representations were made corresponding to those pleaded (my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [92] - [99] , [113]-[115], [117], [120]-[122]). Mr Proud had worked with Mr North in providing the new refrigeration system to Kalfresh. I found that Mr Proud had worked there with Mr North in circumstances where Mr North had been responsible for the design of both the refrigeration system for the Kalfresh plant and its control software. That plant also had nine cooling tanks, albeit located in an insulated room. However, it was different, and would operate in different circumstances, from the new line. Mr Proud told Mr North that Bruynooghe would be responsible for providing the control logic software for its system (my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [143] - [145]).  As the emphasised words made clear, North East Equity had failed to prove its pleaded case on these representations and so I considered that s 51A had no relevance. But, in any event, Proud Nominees and Mr Proud had adduced evidence as to the basis on which the representations about the pack out rate were made. This included the use of a split shift and the operation of the new line as contemplated in Mr Webster's memorandum of 1 August 2002, having regard to the operating capacities of the equipment in the new line that I described in my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [73] - [91]. Mr Proud also had set out the basis of his calculations in his letter of 30 September 2002 as the Full Court noted: appeal judgment [2010] FCAFC 60 at [34] - [35].  I found that representations were made corresponding to those pleaded (my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [92] - [99] , [113]-[115], [117], [120]-[122]). Mr Proud had worked with Mr North in providing the new refrigeration system to Kalfresh. I found that Mr Proud had worked there with Mr North in circumstances where Mr North had been responsible for the design of both the refrigeration system for the Kalfresh plant and its control software. That plant also had nine cooling tanks, albeit located in an insulated room. However, it was different, and would operate in different circumstances, from the new line. Mr Proud told Mr North that Bruynooghe would be responsible for providing the control logic software for its system (my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [143] - [145]).  North East Equity failed to prove that Proud Nominees and Mr Proud did not have reasonable grounds to make these representations. First, Mr Proud made them in the context of the above evidence. Secondly, given that I found that the new line had the capacity represented, he was right. On the evidence at the trial, there was no credible basis to suggest that he (and Proud Nominees) did not have reasonable grounds to make those correct representations (cf [2008] FCA 1189 at [246]). (2) Temperature
  I also found that the parties knew at the time that the contract and representations were made, that the sizes of the carrots delivered for processing on the new line affected its capacity. This was obvious ([2008] FCA 1189 at [320]-[330]). I was not satisfied that the new line was not reasonably fit for the purpose of having the ability to sort and grade carrots into eight different streams of length and size. I was not satisfied that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud did not have reasonable grounds to make representations about what the new line would be capable of processing. The parties understood that the performance and speed of the new line on any occasion depended on what volumes, quality, types and sizes of carrots were fed into it and how that input was managed in operating it: my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [115], [254], [315], [331]-[341].  I found Mr Proud was experienced in how production plants in the food processing industry operated (my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 [79]). He had done many courses including with Newtec, Gillenkirch and Bruynooghe to familiarise himself with his suppliers' equipment, and the operation of fruit and vegetable washing, grading and packing equipment and plants, including sophisticated ones of the kind he was discussing with Mr Tana. He had supplied a considerable number of machines, equipment and plants in the six years before the representations were made. This included supplying, over a period, 10 items of equipment to North East Equity that were used in the old line. He was, as I found, familiar with how Mr Tana and Mr Webster proposed to operate the new line with a split shift and why that was to be done: my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 [31]-[38].  In that context, it was significant when I examined the evidence, that the new line operated under conditions, and with carrots of a quality, that were materially differently from what had been contemplated at the time of the contract and representations. The quality of carrots was worse, the volume of reject carrots processed was greater and North East Equity did not have competent personnel operating the new line. I found that those were significant additional constraints on the contemplated operation of the new line that adversely affected it (my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [164] - [167], [238]-[240], [247], [250]-[252], [256], [279]-[280]).  The parties' statements of issues and their written and oral submissions did not address this representation specifically at all. Mr Proud gave unchallenged written evidence that there had been considerable wastage in the old line because class 2 carrots had been removed from it during processing and placed once again in the wooden bins or crates. (I had found that these held about 410 kg of carrots: my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [181]. ) Those carrots initially, had been tipped with all the other carrots from wooden crates or bins into the beginning of the old line before being graded out and placed back into the bins. Mr Proud said that the bins with the class 2 carrots were taken into cool rooms, later brought back to the old line and the carrots were then tipped out of the bins a second time to be packed. I found that these representations were correct. As Mr Tana said at the meeting of 18 November 2003, labour costs had reduced by 25% or more: [2008] FCA 1189 at [290] , [345(4)]. The automation proposed by Proud Nominees and Mr Proud for the new line, as they would have appreciated, would be very likely to reduce the number of employees North East Equity needed to work at the new line. So much was obvious. North East Equity failed to show that those representations had no reasonable basis. This plea raised a false issue. It was not necessary to deal in any detail with these representations in light of Mr Tana's admission. (5) Reduction in damage to carrots
  I considered each relevant representation in my principal reasons: [2008] FCA 1189 at [345] . For ease of comprehension of these reasons I will repeat that paragraph below and analyse the representations as to future matters by reference to the five categories identified in that paragraph. I will then explain why Proud Nominees and Mr Proud had adduced evidence to the contrary for the purposes of s 51A(2) so that they were not deemed not to have reasonable grounds for making the representations as to future matters. As that order made clear, the remitter was for the purpose of the provision of my reasons for the conclusion I had reached on the s 51A claims when I delivered my reasons on 12 August 2008: my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [346] . There, I said that "on the findings I have made, it is not necessary to consider these claims". The Full Court's order for remittal of the matter was not expressed to permit the parties to re-open their cases or their submissions.  I delivered my principal reasons after the trial of these proceedings on 12 August 2008 ( North East Equity Pty Ltd v Proud Nominees Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1189) ( my principal reasons ). After directing the parties to address on the relief that flowed from them, I made orders on 2 September 2008 dismissing, among other things, North East Equity's claim with costs and permitting the parties to set off their respective costs orders ( North East Equity Pty Ltd v Proud Nominees Pty Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 1430). In these reasons I will use the same nomenclature as I did in my principal reasons.  I will then explain why Proud Nominees and Mr Proud had adduced evidence to the contrary for the purposes of s 51A(2) so that they were not deemed not to have reasonable grounds for making the representations as to future matters. The onus of proof then shifted to North East Equity to establish that Proud Nominees and Mr Proud did not have reasonable grounds for each such representation, as the Full Court confirmed: [2010] FCAFC 60 at [35]. In my principal reasons ([2008] FCA 1189 at [345]) I said: 
 
 "[345] I summarise below the contractual terms and representations which I have found Proud Machinery made to North East Equity and my findings on them. In analysing whether the new line, as installed, conformed with the purposes and terms referred to in [66](a)-(e) above, I have had regard to the implication that the new line would be reasonably fit for those purposes ( Helicopter Sales 132 CLR at 4, 6, 8, 15: see [64]-[66] above). 
 

 
 
 (1) Pack out rate per hour 
 

 
 
 I have not found that terms or representations were made exactly corresponding to those pleaded and set out at [66](a) and [67](g) above. In my principal reasons I found that both Mr Tana and Mr Proud knew the limitations on the brush washers and both had understood what was represented (in the sense I found) was that the new line would pack out at 18.75 tonnes per hour if operated in the way I found: [2008] FCA 1189 at [73] - [87]; see too at [88]-[91]. I said: 
 
 "[87] I am not satisfied that North East Equity has established its pleaded allegations that Proud Nominees entered into a contract which included a term or represented that the new line would have '... the capacity to process and pack in excess of 150 tonnes of carrots in an 8 hour working day (being equivalent to 18.75 tonnes per hour)' (sub-par (a)) in the sense of a continuous day. Nor am I satisfied that the alleged term or representation in sub-par (g) existed in that sense. Rather, I find that, at the time of entry into the contract, there was a term or a representation that the new line would have the capacity to process and pack at a rate of production per operating hour of 18.75 tonnes in terms of final pack out on the pallet . This later reduced to 17.55 tonnes, once Mr Tana deleted the handline. " (emphasis added) 
 

  I also found that the parties knew at the time that the contract and representations were made, that the sizes of the carrots delivered for processing on the new line affected its capacity. This was obvious ([2008] FCA 1189 at [320]-[330]). I was not satisfied that the new line was not reasonably fit for the purpose of having the ability to sort and grade carrots into eight different streams of length and size. I was not satisfied that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud did not have reasonable grounds to make representations about what the new line would be capable of processing. The parties understood that the performance and speed of the new line on any occasion depended on what volumes, quality, types and sizes of carrots were fed into it and how that input was managed in operating it: my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [115], [254], [315], [331]-[341].  I found that the new plant was reasonably capable of processing carrots at 5&#176;C or less, even if there were a small risk (that in any event was unlikely to affect the quality of the turn out in any material way) that a few carrots in the smaller volume sizes might slip through the system without having been chilled at 5&#176;C (my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [324] ). I was not satisfied that the refrigeration system did not operate in accordance with its contractual and represented capacity ([2008] FCA 1189 at [302]; see too at [174]-[175], [265]). And my finding as to the capacity of the new plant suggested (as I find was the case) that the skill and judgment Mr Proud had exercised in recommending the equipment and in making the representations as to temperature had a reasonable basis when Proud Nominees and Mr Proud made them.  As I found, a representation was made that the hydro-cooling tanks could be controlled in a way that would make them capable of producing a constant product output for the packing line ([2008] FCA 1189 at [115]). And, it was obvious that by including the supply and installation of nine hydro-cooler tanks as part of the new line there was a reasonable basis to make the representations that it would have those tanks and that this would allow one of those tanks to be available for each length or size to be graded and provide the opportunity for a spare tank to be available.  As I found there were no records of waste or damage to carrots in evidence so as to enable any finding to be made as to the position before or after the new line was installed (my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [345(5)] ). North East Equity failed to prove that Proud Nominees and Mr Proud did not have reasonable grounds for making this particular representation.  I found Mr Proud was experienced in how production plants in the food processing industry operated (my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 [79]). He had done many courses including with Newtec, Gillenkirch and Bruynooghe to familiarise himself with his suppliers' equipment, and the operation of fruit and vegetable washing, grading and packing equipment and plants, including sophisticated ones of the kind he was discussing with Mr Tana. He had supplied a considerable number of machines, equipment and plants in the six years before the representations were made. This included supplying, over a period, 10 items of equipment to North East Equity that were used in the old line. He was, as I found, familiar with how Mr Tana and Mr Webster proposed to operate the new line with a split shift and why that was to be done: my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 [31]-[38].  I found that the length sizing or grading machines were of a standard acceptable in the industry at the time they were supplied (my principal reasons [2008] 1189 at [327]-[330], [116]). They worked as Mr Tana understood the representations were conveying they would work, as I found. Mr Proud had a similar understanding to Mr Tana of the inherent imperfections of length graders: [2008] FCA 1189 [327]-[329].  I found that the new plant was reasonably capable of processing carrots at 5&#176;C or less, even if there were a small risk (that in any event was unlikely to affect the quality of the turn out in any material way) that a few carrots in the smaller volume sizes might slip through the system without having been chilled at 5&#176;C (my principal reasons [2008] FCA 1189 at [324] ). I was not satisfied that the refrigeration system did not operate in accordance with its contractual and represented capacity ([2008] FCA 1189 at [302]; see too at [174]-[175], [265]). And my finding as to the capacity of the new plant suggested (as I find was the case) that the skill and judgment Mr Proud had exercised in recommending the equipment and in making the representations as to temperature had a reasonable basis when Proud Nominees and Mr Proud made them. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 60">3 In dealing with the ss 52 and 53 (c) claims the primary judge proceeded on the basis that "Where experienced business people have concluded an agreement, that contract will normally provide a very good starting point, and often an equally good finish, in ascertaining what terms and representations were made which caused the parties to proceed as they did": [2008] FCA 1189 at [344] . His Honour found that the parties understood that the terms of their contract "were, in effect, representations". Accordingly the ss 52 and 53 (c) claims collapsed with the contract claim. 2 The primary judge dismissed the proceeding: North East Equity Pty Ltd v Proud Nominees Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1189. Having identified the terms of the contract, his Honour found that they had not been breached. In addition he concluded that any economic loss the appellant claimed to have suffered was not caused by any alleged deficiencies in the new equipment. He also found that the appellant had no title to bring the contract claim, having earlier assigned its rights under the contract to a financier in connection with the purchase. The findings made with respect to the contract claim necessarily led to the failure of the claim in tort. 7 His Honour found that the terms or representations were, as pleaded, that the new line would:
 
(a) be designed so as to be reasonably fit to sort and grade carrots into eight distinct streams of size and length;
 
(b) have nine hydro-cooling tanks, which would allow one for each length or size grade and one spare, and
 
(c) provide quality length sizing for three separate tanks. He was not satisfied that the length graders (there being no complaint about the width or girth graders) did not provide quality length sizing in accordance with what both parties understood were their "inherent limitations" (par (c)). Nor was he satisfied that the new line was not reasonably fit for the purpose in (a). He was satisfied that the tanks complied with representation (b). The "inherent limitations" was a reference to evidence that length graders generally were inherently inaccurate because of the shape of carrots. See [2008] FCA 1189 at [326] - [330] .
  6 The primary judge found that the terms or representations were, as pleaded, that the new line would:
 
(a) be designed so as to be reasonably fit to process farm fresh carrots at field temperatures and achieve a core temperature of packed carrots of not more than 5deg.C, and
 
(b) achieve a guaranteed maximum of 5deg.C core temperature for the appellant's carrots, have hydro-cooling tanks capable of producing constant product output, and be capable of controlling the temperature of the carrots. His Honour was not satisfied that the new line did not have these capacities "if operated correctly". His Honour had dealt at length with the lack of competence in the operation of the new equipment on the part of two of the appellant's key employees, despite instruction by or on behalf of Proud Machinery, and the problems this created in the proper working of the new line. See in particular [2008] FCA 1189 at [166] - [167] and [175].

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] SADC 30">Based on these principles of general application, counsel argued 'it is almost trite that such a contract would imply that the overall package of the truck together with the unit should be able to be legally driven'. [133] The cases relied on to support this proposition turned on differently characterised issues: Reg Glass Pty Ltd v Rivers Locking Systems Pty Ltd [134] (breach of implied warranty of fitness), G.H. Myers &amp; Co. v Brent Cross Service Co [135] (implied warranty goods were of good quality and reasonably fit for intended purpose), a decision approved in Helicopter Sales (Australia) Pty Ltd v Rotor-Work Pty Ltd [136] (implied warranties that the materials were of good quality and free from latent defects and reasonably fit for their intended purpose) and North East Equity Pty Ltd v Proud Nominees Pty Ltd (No.2) [137] (implied condition that goods supplied would be reasonably fit for the purposes of the purchaser). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1430">9 But, the question which arises is whether North East Equity should be allowed to rely on a new plea that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud would exercise reasonable care and skill in the performance of their services, including the selection of goods or working materials, that were reasonably fit for the purposes for which North East Equity had (here by implication) indicated they were required: North East Equity (No 2) [2008] FCA 1189 at [367] . 3 As I observed in North East Equity (No 2) [2008] FCA 1189 at [380] , North East Equity had not appeared to make any separate claim for damages based on deficiencies in, and disruption caused by, the flume elevators. North East Equity now accepts that that accurately described its pleaded position. Today it has sought to make an amendment to its pleadings so as to bring them into line with what it said was the case run at trial. 19 During the course of argument I suggested to counsel that there were difficulties that might be occasioned, were I to make orders for costs on particular issues to be calculated in particular ways. I am of opinion that the claim for economic loss had no proper basis for the reasons that I gave in my earlier judgment. I would have been minded to order indemnity costs on that issue because, as I found, the assumptions given to Mr Langridge were without foundation and the claim for nearly $5 million before interest was made based on those assumptions: North East Equity (No 2) [2008] FCA 1189 at [230] . 1 When I delivered my reasons in North East Equity Pty Ltd v Proud Nominees Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1189 I asked the parties to consider them and address the question of final orders which ought be made flowing from them. There are now outstanding these two questions. First, whether I should allow an amendment to the statement of claim so as to permit a further allegation of negligence to be added that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud negligently procured and installed a flume elevator system that was not fit for its purpose of transferring carrots from the brush washers to the diameter sizers. Secondly, how costs should be awarded.
  7 However, I found that a different arrangement had been made. That included a recognition that ultimately the problems with the flume elevators had to be fixed. Although initially it had been proposed that the solution would be achieved by installing the new pumps (which was done), in the end that did not successfully resolve the problem. This led to the need to design substitute equipment. As I found in North East Equity (No 2) [2008] FCA 1189 at [373] those present at the meeting of 18 November, including Proud Machinery and Mr Proud, recognised that the flume elevators were not operating to the standard which they ought to have achieved. That problem was never remedied.</sentence>
