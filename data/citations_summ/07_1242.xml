<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 57">7 A finding of fact made by the primary judge (see Village Building Co Limited v Airservices Australi a [2007] FCA 1242 at [4] ) was that on 18 June 2007, Airservices Australia advised Canberra International that it considered the draft ANEF to be suitable for endorsement. This finding has not been challenged. In any event, since the hearing before the primary judge, uncontentious evidence has been led that Airservices Australia proposes to endorse the draft ANEF, a fact which underpinned Gyles J's decision to grant an injunction on 2 October 2007 restraining Airservices Australia from endorsing the draft ANEF pending the hearing of the appeal (see Village Building Co Limited v Airservices Australia [2007] FCA 1547). Thus the appeal can proceed on the footing that it is accepted by the parties that the draft ANEF will be endorsed by Airservices Australia and when endorsed, will be included by Canberra International Airport in a draft master plan. However, this raises the question of whether the agreed facts (or an agreement as to future conduct) lead to a justiciable controversy between Village, on the one hand, and Airservices Australia and Canberra International on the other. 154 The primary judge identified three principal issues as to the capacity of AA to endorse the new draft Canberra International Airport ANEF. His Honour expressed the first of these as follows (see The Village Building Co Ltd (ACN 056 509 025) v Airservices Australia and Another [2007] FCA 1242 ; (2007) 241 ALR 685) at [5] as follows:
 
 
 '(1) Village asserts that s 9(2) of the Air Services Act requires that Airservices must examine all the underlying assumptions on which the draft ANEF is based in order to see whether they provide a reasonable or realistic foundation for the projections which are based on them. Airservices argues that its function of endorsement does not require it to make an assessment of the validity, commercial viability or likelihood of the assumptions which the proponent of an ANEF uses as a basis of its calculations.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 247">1 On 15 August 2007, a judge of this Court dismissed an application by The Village Building Co Ltd for judicial review of conduct associated with the development of an Australian Noise Exposure Forecast ("ANEF"): The Village Building Co Ltd v Airservices Australia [2007] FCA 1242. Putting to one side challenges made in this litigation, the ANEF probably will, in due course, be considered as an element in the planning for the future use of Canberra Airport. Village appealed against that judgment. The appeal was expedited and heard on 29 October 2007, although judgment in the appeal has not been given. The lessee of the airport and the second respondent in the appeal, Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd, has applied, by way of notice of motion dated 23 January 2008, for an injunction restraining Village from taking any step to advance the rezoning of its land which arguably is potentially seriously affected by airport noise. Canberra International also seeks what in substance is a mandatory injunction requiring Village to withdraw a request to the New South Wales Department of Planning to determine a rezoning application in a particular way. This relief is sought pending judgment in the appeal.</sentence>
