<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] VSC 244">9 The meaning of the expression "on the cards" has been considered in Australia. In the insurance context, Lindgren J in FAI General Insurance Co Ltd v McSweeney [15] stated that circumstances "may give rise to a claim where the bringing of the claim against the insured in respect of them was a 'definite risk' or a 'real possibility' or 'on the cards'. " In the medical context in a murder appeal, in Erich v R [16] , concerning the meaning of the word "probable" used in cross-examination of a pathologist, the Court referred to passages in Koufos above cited and then expressed the compendium "something which is a serious or distinct possibility or which is 'on the cards'". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 60">2 Their appeal seeks to overturn the exercise of a discretion by a Judge of this Court who granted leave to join them as additional respondents to proceedings commenced against a valuation company and one of its valuers (who are the second and third respondents to this appeal). The orders and judgment under appeal were made and was delivered on 4 July 2006 ( Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 847). The judgment of 4 July 2006, in large part, reflected reasons in an earlier judgment of 29 May 2006 ( Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Limited [2006] FCA 640). Both judgments, read together, provide the reasons for the orders for joinder, made on 4 July 2006. Leave to appeal was given by a Judge exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Court on 28 September 2006 ( Macquarie Underwriting Pty Ltd v Permanent Custodians Limited [2006] FCA 1291). </sentence>
