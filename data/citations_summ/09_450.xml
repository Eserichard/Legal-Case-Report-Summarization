<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 147">116 The primary judge, Finkelstein J, said at [2] that "[w]hat lies behind this allegation is Multiplex's desire to stop the action in its tracks": Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd [2009] FCA 450 ; (2009) 256 ALR 427. In dismissing the application, his Honour said at [6] that the difficulties in construing the definition of "managed investment scheme" fall away when the construction takes account of the purpose of Ch 5C of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 803">The plaintiffs failed in the MIS action: see Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 450 ; (2009) 256 ALR 427. Now the defendants rely on the offer to argue they are entitled to have the costs, which will be awarded in their favour, taxed on a party and party basis up to 5 January 2009 and from then on an indemnity basis. </sentence>
