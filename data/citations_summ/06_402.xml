<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1240">
 


 
16 It is not entirely clear whether leave to appeal is necessary in relation to orders made under rule 13.10 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (see, for example, SYWB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 402). However, it is readily apparent from what has been set out above that this is a case in which an application for leave to appeal would be futile and, indeed, an appeal from the decision of the learned Federal Magistrate would inevitably fail if reliance were placed upon the grounds specified. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 620">5 In SYWB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 402 , 18 April 2006, Lander J had occasion to review authorities bearing upon the question as to whether when a lower court had dismissed a proceeding summarily, leave to appeal to this Court from such a decision was required. His Honour noted that the authorities bearing on that question were not all one way. In the result, and particularly influenced by the High Court's decision in Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 , his Honour was disposed to proceed on the basis that leave to appeal was required. Essentially, for the reasons that Lander J gave, I am also disposed to proceed on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCAFC 183">41 The judges of this Court have differed as to the significance of Re Luck : contrast MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 466 at [7] per Kenny J; SZEEO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 546 at [11] per Tamberlin J; NADZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 975 at [29] - [30] per Graham J; and SBFF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 178 ; (2007) 158 FCR 49 (" SBFF ") at 51 per Mansfield J with S1000 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 285 at [2] per Selway J; SZDEG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 748 at [8] - [9] per Branson J; SYWB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 402 at [30] - [49] per Lander J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 178">2 The Federal Magistrate dismissed the review application as an abuse of process under r 13.10(c) of the Federal Magistrate Court Rules 2001 , and ordered the applicant to pay the costs of the first respondent. His Honour's reasons also indicate that he dismissed the application because he did not have the jurisdiction to entertain it, although his order of 26 September 2006 is confined to the abuse of process determination. 3 The parties proceeded on the basis that, as the application to the Federal Magistrates Court was determined summarily as an abuse of process, it is an interlocutory judgment: see Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 78 ALJR 177 ; SYWB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 402 at [48] ; MZWHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 491 ; Rana v University of South Australia [2004] FCA 559 ; (2004) 136 FCR 344 at [8] - [15]; SZEIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798. The nature of the present application, being an application for leave to appeal, appears to recognise that position: see s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the FCA). By way of contrast, an appeal lies as of right from a final decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: see s 24(1)(d) of the FCA. 7 The differences stem from the application of two decisions of the High Court to the different circumstances of each case: Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (1980) 147 CLR 35 and Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 78 ALJR 177. In SYWB [2006] FCA 402 at [33] , Lander J suggested that those two decisions may not sit readily together. 6 There are a number of decision of the Court which, in different circumstances, treat summary dismissal as an interlocutory judgment or as a final judgment: cf SYWB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 402 ; MZWHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 491 with NADZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 975 ; MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 507 ; MZXIW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 123 ; MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 466. </sentence>
