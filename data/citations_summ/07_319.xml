<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 1719">
 
 7. The first respondent's written submissions indicate that the particulars pleaded assert a breach of s.424A of the Migration Act because the Tribunal based its findings on information or lack of information in the applicant's protection visa application and was required to give the applicant particulars of this information in writing. Mr White, for the respondents, submits that there is no factual basis for this assertion as the Tribunal did not rely upon any "information or lack of information contained in the applicant's protection visa application". The Tribunal relied on evidence the applicant gave at the first and second Tribunal hearing to find that he did not face a real chance of persecution in the reasonably foreseeable future. The obligation in s.424A(1) does not apply to information that the applicant gave for the purpose of an application for review (s.424A(3)(b)). The exception in s.424A(3)(b) applies to information the applicant gave not only to the second Tribunal hearing but also to the first Tribunal hearing: SXSB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 319 at [24] - [26] per Besanko J; SZFBJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 1472 at [8] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 1787">The effect of such cases was succinctly summarised by Besanko J in SXSB v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 319 at [25] : "The authorities draw a distinction between information given for the purpose of the application for review and information elicited by the Tribunal during the course of a hearing".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1031">12 The appellants arguments commence from and rely upon 'the critical passage' of the Tribunal's reasons set out above. That is supplemented by other briefer passages to similar effect. The appellant submits that the paragraph betokens jurisdictional error as being identical to the impugned reasoning in SZECF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1200 ; (2005) 89 ALD 242 at [26] - [28] - [30] and [34]; SZDKK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1203 at [25] - [25]; SZEEU [2006] FCAFC 2 ; 150 FCR 214 per Weinberg J at [158] and Allsop J at [220]-[221]; SXSB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 319 at [19] ; NBKS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 174 ; (2006) 156 FCR 205 at [32] - [39] per Weinberg J at [74] per Allsop J; SZGGT V Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [72] ; SZGDB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 431 at [25]- [26] and SZCNP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1140 at [17] . </sentence>
