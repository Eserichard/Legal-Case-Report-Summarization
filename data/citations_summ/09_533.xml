<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 518">The parties acknowledge in their joint submissions that 2 of the 7 persons named as the applicant have died since the application was amended in 1999. A question therefore arises as to whether the other 5 persons are authorised to deal with all matters arising in relation to the application pursuant to the Native Title Act . Where the terms of the authorisation encompass and accommodate the death or incapacity of any one, or more, of the persons named as applicant, for example, by making express provision for the on-going or continuing authorisation of the remaining persons who comprise the applicant following the death or incapacity of any other named applicant, the remaining person or persons named applicants may continue to deal with all matters arising under the Native Title Act in relation to the application: Anderson v Western Australia [2007] FCA 1733 at [37] ; Coyne v Western Australia [2009] FCA 533 at [56] ; Roe v Western Australia (No. 2) [2011] FCA 102 at [149] ; cf Lennon v South Australia [2010] FCA 743. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 516">The parties acknowledge in their joint submissions that 7 of the 15 persons named as the applicant are now deceased since the application was filed in 1999. A question therefore arises as to whether the other 8 persons are authorised to deal with all matters arising in relation to the application pursuant to the Native Title Act . Where the terms of the authorisation encompass and accommodate the death or incapacity of any one, or more, of the persons named as applicant, for example, by making express provision for the on-going or continuing authorisation of the remaining persons who comprise the applicant following the death or incapacity of any other named applicant, the remaining person or persons named as applicant may continue to deal with all matters arising under the Native Title Act in relation to the application: Anderson v Western Australia [2007] FCA 1733 at [37] ; Coyne v Western Australia [2009] FCA 533 at [56] ; Roe v Western Australia (No. 2) [2011] FCA 102 at [149] ; cf Lennon v South Australia [2010] FCA 743. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 421">Further, Mr Roe has no personal right to be a member of the persons comprising the applicant. There is no provision in the Native Title Act which provides that an applicant must be comprised of representatives of each of the subgroups within the native title claim group. See Coyne v State of Western Australia [2009] FCA 533 at [24] , Butterworth on behalf of the Wiri Core Country Claim v Queensland [2010] FCA 325 at [31] and Que Noy v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 1888 at [23] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FCA 102">Although a meeting to replace an applicant should be attended by persons fairly representative of the claim group, authorisation can nonetheless be validly given by a small percentage of the whole claim group provided that the process leading to that authorisation has been appropriately notified and conducted. In Coyne v Western Australia [2009] FCA 533 , for example, a meeting of 72 people (including 29 people opposed to its outcome) was able to authorise the change of applicant for a broader claim group of between 5,000 and 20,000. His Honour, Siopis J at [51] concluded that because the meeting had been widely notified, including that the meeting could consider changing the applicant, it could be inferred that: 
 
 Those who decided not to attend the meeting were content to abide by any decision made by those who did attend the meeting and ... accordingly, the decisions made at the meeting were the legitimate binding expression of the view of the ... claim group as a whole. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1406">A similar contention was considered by Siopis J recently in Coyne v State of Western Australia [2009] FCA 533. In that case his Honour observed: 
 
 22 Each of Mr Samuel Miller and Mr Smith deposed that he was an elder of his family. Each went on to say that if he was to be removed as a member of the applicant, no elder from his family group would comprise part of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 743">Coyne v State of Western Australia [2009] FCA 533 incidentally concerned such a circumstance. It primarily concerned the validity of a decision of the claim group of 1 December 2007 (after the commencement of the 2007 Amending Act) authorising some only of the then authorised persons under s 251B to thereafter continue to act as the applicant to deal with matters relating to the application. The newly authorised persons had applied under the then s 66B to be made a party to the application as the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 1052">Mr Blackshield drew my attention to the case of Coyne v State of Western Australia [2009] FCA 533 ( Coyne ) in which I considered the effect of the authorisation resolutions passed at the claim group authorisation meeting held in Albany on 1 December 2007.</sentence>
