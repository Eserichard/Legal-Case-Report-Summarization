<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 258">In order for a charge to be made out under s 42 it must be established that the impugned act has been performed "on the ground that" the victim has done one of the things identified in s 42(2) of the DDA. The required causal connection between the complainant's act and the defendant's response has been considered in a number of cases. They were reviewed by Buchanan J in Penhall-Jones v New South Wales [2007] FCA 925 at [85] . His Honour concluded that: 
 
 "Accordingly the authorities are unified in their approach that the ground or reason relied upon to establish breach of the relevant legal obligation need not be the sole factor but it must be a substantial and operative factor . At least one circumstance from the list in s 42(2) of the Act must be a reason for the alleged detriment or threatened detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCAFC 33">The facts that may give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias are many and various. In some circumstances a reasonable apprehension of bias may arise by reason of, for example, intemperate language employed by those conducting a hearing (cf. Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte AB (2000) 177 ALR 225 at 230; Penhall-Jones v New South Wales [2007] FCA 925 at [92] to [97]) or the terminology employed in an administrative decision or draft decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 843">Although s.42 creates an offence, it is also open for an aggrieved person to bring a civil action alleging unlawful discrimination by reason of alleged victimisation under s.42 of the DD Act . In Penhall-Jones v New South Wales [25] the Federal Court observed as follows: 10. Sections 46P and 46PO are in Part IIB of the HREOC Act (which provides for 'redress for unlawful discrimination'). A complaint alleging victimisation may be dealt with under the provisions in Part IIB of the HREOC Act because s 3 of the HREOC Act defines 'unlawful discrimination' to include: '...any conduct that is an offence under: (d) Division 4 of Part 2 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 . ' Section 42 of the Act appears in Division 4 of Part 2 of the Act. Accordingly the Federal Magistrates Court has power to deal with an application alleging victimisation under the Act if a complaint to that effect is terminated under s 46PH of the HREOC Act. Such proceedings are civil proceedings. They are to be distinguished from proceedings for an offence brought directly under s 42 of the Act (see O'Connor v Ross (No 1) [2002] FMCA 210 at [11]).

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] NSWADT 101">106 In Penhall-Jones v State of New South Wales [2007] FCA 925 at [68] &#173;-[86], Buchanan J considered the meaning of the words " on the ground that " in s 42 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) ( DD Act ). After considering the relevant authorities on causation, including the High Court's discussion in Purvis of the expression " because of " in s 5(1) of the DD Act, Buchanan concluded as [85] as follows: 
 
 
 "Accordingly the authorities are unified in their approach that the ground or reason relied upon to establish breach of the relevant legal obligation need not be the sole factor but it must be a substantial and operative factor. At least one circumstance from the list in s 42(2) of the Act must be a reason for the alleged detriment or threatened detriment. It must afford a rational explanation, at least in part, 'why' an action was taken . The connection cannot be made by a mere temporal conjunction of events, by an incidental but non-causal relationship or by speculation. The establishment of the suggested ground is as much a matter for proper proof as any other factual circumstance. " (emphasis added) </sentence>

In particular, the Appeal Panel considered whether the fact that s 4A of the AD Act is not expressed to apply to complaints of victimisation means that " on the ground of " should be given a different meaning in s 50. The Appeal Panel noted that in Penhall-Jones v State of New South Wales [2007] FCA 925 Buchanan J gave the words a different meaning. I atht case, his Honour held at [69] that s 10 of the DDA (the equivalent to s 4A of the AD Act) did not affect the meaning of s 42 (the equivalent of s 50 of the AD Act).

The Federal Court upheld the findings of Driver FM that the writing of that letter did not constitute victimisation: Penhall-Jones v State of NSW [2007] FCA 925. At [63] Buchanan J expressed doubt as to whether the letter even constituted a threat and went on to say that:

 
 
 Some indication of the seriousness with which Ms Penhall-Jones' accusations were viewed and, in particular, that they were regarded as inappropriate was not only natural but necessary if, in response to a continuation of allegations of that kind, the MOT wished to take action as a result. .

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 957">The first respondent submitted generally in relation to the claim of victimisation that in paragraphs 28 and 29 Ms Davidson had failed to plead the basis upon which this conduct constituted victimisation, in that she failed to plead the facts, matters and circumstances on which she alleged that she proposed to make a complaint, or reasonably proposed to assert her rights under the anti-discrimination legislation prior to suffering the alleged act of victimisation and the facts, matters and circumstances by which the act of victimisation was taken for a prohibited reason, that was a " substantial and operating factor " (see Penhall-Jones v NSW [2007] FCA 925 at [69] ; Lina Obieta v New South Wales Department of Education and Training and Ors [2007] FCA 86 at [240] ; Huang v University of New South Wales &amp; Ors [2008] FMCA 11 at [120] ; Damiano &amp; Anor v Wilkinson &amp; Anor [2004] FMCA 891 at [22] ).

 However, that provision does not . . . bear upon the meaning to be attributed to the phrase 'on the ground' in s 42. Section 10 does not address the assessment of grounds or reasons which form part of an act of victimization, but only acts of discrimination in an earlier part of the Act in which s 10 appears. Section 10, therefore, does not establish, in favour of Ms Penhall-Jones' case, any proposition that existence of one of the conditions for the engagement of s 42 might be an insubstantial reason. [Emphasis added. ]</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1773">11 Other than the language used by the Federal Magistrate in his reasons for decision, there is thus no basis upon which any argument as to a lack of " fairness " could be advanced in the present appeal. That language, although it may have been more prudent for the observations to have been differently expressed, falls far short of establishing any reasonably held belief that the Federal Magistrate was not determining the case before him " fairly " and " reasonably ". There is no basis upon which it could be contended that the Federal Magistrate was not acting " impartially and without prejudice ". Each case must obviously be decided upon its own facts. But it may be noted that in Penhall-Jones v New South Wales [2007] FCA 925 a Federal Magistrate was not disqualified by reason of characterising an allegation that an offer had been made as a " bribe " as " ridiculous ". That and other " strong " language, Buchanan J concluded, did not demonstrate on the part of the Federal Magistrate " a lack of preparedness to deal with [the case] in a balanced way ": at [95]. The manner in which a judgment is expressed may evidence a reasonable apprehension of bias: Vakuata v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 573. But the use of intemperate language, of itself, does not necessarily result in a decision being set aside: Klinger v Nicholl [2005] FCAFC 153 ; Naisauvou v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 86 at [32] [1999] FCA 86 ; , 89 FCR 435 at 443. </sentence>

37 A relevant summary, with respect to the proper application of the civil standard of proof, Ms Anderson said was set out in the decision given on the 28th June, 2007 by Justice Buchanan of the Federal Court in Penhall/Jones Vs State of NSW [2007] FCA 925. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FamCA 1364">Statements to that effect should not, however, be understood as directed to the standard of proof.

(citations removed)
 In the recent Federal Court decision of Penhall-Jones v State of NSW [2007] FCA 925 , Buchanan J in determining an appeal from the decision of a Federal Magistrate identified the distinction between the standard of proof and quality of evidence required at par 118:
 
[118] It is generally accepted, and the citations I have extracted are examples, that there is a need to distinguish between identification of the appropriate standard of proof (on the balance of probabilities in a civil case) and the quality of evidence which will satisfy the standard in a particular case. That is a matter which may vary according to the gravity of the accusations or contentions to be evaluated. Although the balance of probabilities remains the civil standard of proof, what may be required to satisfy that standard of proof in a given case, and satisfy it to the 'reasonable satisfaction' of the court, is not fixed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] ACTDT 8">65. It is to be recognised that an employer will generally have more than one reason for acting in respect of an employee. Under the Discrimination Act , the fact that there was more than one reason for the treatment complained of does not avoid the application of section 10 of the Discrimination Act (see section 4A Discrimination Act ). The complainant must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the respondent treated him unfavourably and that one of the attributes specified in section 7 was a substantial and operative factor for doing so. The ground or reason relied on to establish a breach of the relevant legal obligation need not, therefore, be the sole factor but it must be a substantial and operative factor ( General Motors Holden's Pty Ltd v Bowling (1976) 51 ALJR 235 at 241; Penhall-Jones v State of New South Wales [2007] FCA 925).
