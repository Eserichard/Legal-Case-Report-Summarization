<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] WAIRComm 4186">The second respondent Killarnee, represented by different solicitors, made a number of submissions. As to the relevant law, counsel made submissions in relation to s 27(1)(c) of the Act consistent with those made by the other parties. As to the then s 347 of the WRA, the second respondent submitted that the matter before the Commission was "a proceeding... in a matter arising under this Act" (the WRA) under s 347 on the basis that a matter of defence raised by the respondents enlivens this section: Broad Construction Services (WA) Pty Ltd v The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union of Workers (No 2) [2006] FCA 44 which applied Fencott in relation to this issue. It was submitted that for these purposes the relevant "justiciable controversy" before the Commission also required a determination of the respondents' defences relying upon the WRA and therefore the proceedings fell within the then s 347 of the WRA.
