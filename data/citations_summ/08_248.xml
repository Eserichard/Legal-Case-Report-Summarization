<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 102">36 Exemption from the requirements of s 411(11) is a usual adjunct to orders approving schemes to effect mergers or acquisitions. It rarely attracts judicial analysis. However, in Re Hostworks Group Ltd (No 2), [14] Mansfield J articulated the following reasoning on the point: 
 
 "[35] Section 411(11) of the Act contemplates that a copy of the order made by the Court under s 411(4)(b) will be annexed to every copy of the constitution of Hostworks after the order has been made. However, s 411(12) provides that:
 
'The Court may, by order, exempt a body from compliance with subsection (11), or determine the period during which the body must comply with that subsection. '
 
 [36] In Re Equinox Resources Ltd [2004] WASC 143 ; (2004) 49 ACSR 692 , EM Heenan J at [22] indicated that the purpose of section 411(11) was:
 
'... to ensure that any modification of the rights of shareholders of the company which is the subject of the scheme, or any other provision in the scheme which may affect the interests of persons dealing with the company, such as prospective creditors or purchasers of shares, will be sure to have the opportunity of seeing what the exact rights of shareholders in the company or of its creditors are, as modified, if at all, by the scheme which has been approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1424">Paragraphs (a) and (b) of s 411(17) are alternatives. The written statement of 'no objection' by ASIC, while not binding on the Court, removes the requirement that the Court be satisfied that the Scheme was not proposed for a proscribed purpose, although there will always be a residual judicial discretion in that regard under s 411(4)(b) of the Act ( Re Foundation Healthcare Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 973 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 680 (at [29]) per French J; Re Coles Group Ltd (No 2) [2007] VSC 523 ; (2007) 65 ACSR 494 (at [66]-[78]) per Robson J (and the cases cited therein); Re Hostworks Group Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 248 (at [19]) per Mansfield J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1309">The authorities suggest that in considering whether to make an order approving a scheme a Court should consider the following: Whether the procedural matters relating to the meeting of shareholders convened to consider the Scheme have been complied with; Whether the meeting of shareholders convened by the order of the Court has approved the Scheme with the required majority under s 411(4)(b); Whether the Scheme is fair and reasonable; and Whether the remaining requirements of the Act have been satisfied.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] VSC 100">[14] The plaintiffs contend that an exemption from compliance with s 411(11) is appropriate given that: 
 upon implementation of the schemes, the plaintiffs will become wholly owned subsidiaries of Metcash, through it's subsidiary Metcash Trading; and current shareholders are fully informed about the schemes. [15]

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] VSC 546">Therefore, new shareholders, apart from Catalpa will not be entered into the plaintiff's register of members with the effect that Lion Selection will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Catalpa.
