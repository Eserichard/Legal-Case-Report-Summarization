<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 86">More generally, insofar as Mr Gorczynski sought that this court go behind the judgments of the Local Court by way of revisiting the costs assessments (as he had sought to do in the application for leave to appeal from the costs assessments), in an appropriate case the court has the power to go behind a judgment debt to determine whether there is in truth consideration for a judgment debt on an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice, as well as on the hearing of a creditor's petition. However substantial reasons must be given for questioning whether there is, in truth and reality, a debt due to the creditor (see Olivieri v Stafford ; Goyan v Motyka [2009] FCA 776 ; and Boglari v Coadys (a firm) (2009) 7 ABC(NS) 553; [2009] FCA 1398). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 38">In Boglari v Coadys [2009] FCA 1398 His Honour Gray J cites the relevant authorities in relation to the 'discretion' held by a bankruptcy court to go behind a judgment, particularly a default judgment and to investigate the actual state of indebtedness or lack thereof between the creditor and the debtor. His Honour sets these out at [11]-[13] as follows: Going behind the judgment [11] The power of a court on an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice to "go behind the judgment" on which the bankruptcy notice is based is a discretionary power. In an appeal from a judgment involving the exercise of discretion, the question for the appeal court is not whether it would have exercised the discretion differently from the court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 325">I was referred to a recent judgment of Gray J in Boglari v Coadys (A Firm) (Receiver and Manager Appointed) [2009] FCA 1398. In this judgment, Gray J cites the relevant authorities at [11] to [13] in relation to what has been referred to as a 'discretion' held by a bankruptcy court to 'go behind' a judgment, particularly a default judgment, and to investigate the actual state of indebtedness or lack thereof between creditor and debtor. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 58">The Court as presently constituted has had the recent benefit of a decision of Gray J sitting as the Full Court of the Federal Court in Boglari v Coadys [2009] FCA 1398 in which the Court sets out in the clearest terms the basis of the Court's powers and upon which they should be exercised. </sentence>
