<citphrase id="cp10.19" type=cited from="[1979] FCA 85">trade practices act 1974 (cth), s. 45d (1). the appellant, tillmanns butcheries pty. ltd. ("tillmanns"), was a wholesale and retail butcher carrying on business in canberra and queanbeyan. the first-named respondent, the australasian meat industry employees' union ("the union") was an organization of employees including employees of wholesale and retail butchers and employees in abattoirs. the third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents were the president, secretary and two organizers of the union respectively. in december 1977 two of the respondents entered tillmannss' shop in queanbeyan and asked to see the employees. the request was refused by tillmanns' managing director because it was neither smoko nor lunchtime. the union retaliated by imposing a black ban upon tillmanns' shops. at that time canberra abattoir pty. ltd. ("canberra abattoir"), a company which conducted an abattoir in the australian capital territory, held for tillmanns thirty-two cattle awaiting slaughter and the carcasses of twenty head of cattle and seventeen pigs. as a result of the black ban by the union the live cattle were not slaughtered for some weeks and the carcasses were released to tillmanns only about a week later to avoid deterioration. the appellant instituted an action in the federal court of australia seeking an injunction and damages under ss. 80 and 82 in relation to s. 45d of the trade practices act 1974 ("the act ") alleging that the respondents acted in concert to prevent supplies of meat to tillmanns in breach of s. 45d of the act . the trial judge declined to find that the respondents' conduct had the relevant effect and refused to award damages or to grant an injunction. he stated in his judgment, inter alia, that the plaintiff (appellant) was not entitled to argue that the conduct complained of would be likely to cause substantial loss where the means of proving whether in fact it did cause substantial loss were in its power. the appellant appealed to the full court of the federal court of australia against this judgment claiming that an injunction should have been ordered.  held: per curiam</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp10.20" type=cited from="[1979] FCA 85">the appeal against the first, third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents should be upheld, the cross appeal of those respondents should be dismissed and the appellant should be granted injunctive relief against the above-named respondents because: (1) the appellant was entitled to seek relief on the ground that the relevant conduct of the respondents, if continued, would or would be likely to have the effect of causing substantial loss or damage to the appellant's business.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 133">40 The disclosure of highly sensitive confidential material to a trade rival is a routine exercise in this Court. Commercial confidentiality is protected by appropriate directions such as, typically, limiting disclosure to external lawyers and independent experts upon their giving undertakings to the Court. Without such regimes, most intellectual property litigation would be unworkable. We do not see anything in the present case to take it outside the ordinary practice. Confidentiality regimes have been seen as an answer to such concerns in preliminary discovery applications : Griffin Energy Pty Ltd v Western Power Corporation [2006] FCA 1241 at [110] ; Electricity Retail Corporation v Griffin Energy Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1810 at [51] .
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 47">13 Whether a judgment deals with a point of substance with final consequences, rather than a point of practice or procedure (a normal consideration for the grant of leave in any event) may also be important. In the present case the applicant contends that Tamberlin J's decision was, in effect, final unless leave is granted. The respondents, on the other hand, relied on statements to the effect that a decision whether to grant preliminary discovery is about a matter of practice and procedure (see Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1 at [6] ( 'Hooper' ), followed in Electricity Retail Corporation v Griffin Energy Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1810 at [5] ( 'Griffin Energy' )). </sentence>
