<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 395">The factors referred to in the preceding paragraph weigh in favour of a reduction in penalty from the high range to a range in excess of a mid-range penalty but below that of a high range penalty. However, as Lindgren J said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Neville [2007] FCA 1583 at [43] : 
 an important purpose of the penalty to be imposed in the present case is that of general deterrence. It is most important that persons furnishing information or giving evidence in response to a notice issued by the ACCC under s 155 of the TP Act do so frankly and honestly. It serves the public interest that the ACCC be enabled to carry out its investigations efficiently and effectively. Section 155 of the TP Act is directed to that end. If a person who is required to give evidence under s 155(1)(c) of the TP Act gives false or misleading evidence, not only does this have the immediate effect of obstructing and delaying the particular investigation: it also has the potential to direct the ACCC away from other sources of information and to draw human and financial resources away from its other work. The general public should know that conduct of that kind will be treated seriously by the Court.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 374">Mr Alexander submitted that it was not appropriate to impose a term of imprisonment in this case. He contended that this would not reflect parity with other such cases, namely, Trade Practices Commission v Calderton Corporation Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (1994) ATPR 41-306 , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v GIA Pty Ltd (2003) ASAL 55-093, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Neville [2007] FCA 1583 ; (2007) ATPR 42-195. In the first two cases the Court imposed fines for contravention of s 155 and in the third case the Court imposed a fine and a community service order. </sentence>
