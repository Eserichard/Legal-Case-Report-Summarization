<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] FamCA 987">On the definition of exceptional circumstances, I have been referred to the decision of Ho v Professional Services Review Committee No 295 [2007] FCA 388 in the Federal Court of Australia. At paragraph 25 Rares J states: 
 "25. And, in Baker v The Queen [2004] HCA 45 ; (2004) 223 CLR 513 at 573 [173] Callinan J referred with approval to what Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ had said in R v Kelly (Edward) [1999] UKHL 4 ; [2000] QB 198 at 208, namely: 
 
'We must construe "exceptional" as an ordinary, familiar English adjective, and not as a term of art. It describes a circumstance which is such as to form an exception, which is out of the ordinary course, or unusual, or special, or uncommon. To be exceptional a circumstance need not be unique, or unprecedented, or very rare; but it cannot be one that is regularly, or routinely, or normally encountered. '"

In my previous judgment ( Ho [2007] FCA 388 at [114] ) I invited submissions as to whether I should make additional orders in the nature of writs of prohibition prohibiting the members of each of the two committees from further constituting those committees and, secondly, whether orders in the nature of writs of mandamus ought be made requiring the fourth respondent to each proceeding to reconstitute each committee to further consider each of the administrative referrals made under s 86 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) in accordance with law.

14 The hearing before me was conducted as one in which there was an active and substantive argument put not merely as to statutory construction but to support the impartiality of decision-making processes of committees which were under attack for apparent bias. I am of opinion that, having regard to those matters, a fair-minded lay person properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings or process before the committee, were the matter remitted to members who had previously constituted them, might reasonably apprehend that those members might not bring an impartial mind to the making of the decision (see the cases cited in Ho [2007] FCA 388 at [106] . I am therefore of opinion that it is appropriate, albeit extremely unfortunate, to make an order in each matter in the nature of a writ of prohibition which will have the effect that none of the current members of each committee who are capable of being constituted on a further committee be members of any such reconstituted committee.

  11 Counsel for the committees referred to the decision of the Full Court in Oreb v Willcock [2005] FCAFC 196 ; (2005) 146 FCR 237. But Lander J said that there was nothing before the primary judge which meant that the committee there could not reconsider the matter, and that there was no suggestion of bias or apprehension of bias, the only error being simply as to the construction of the Act ( Oreb 146 FCR at 273 [248]). In this case a substantive argument of apparent bias was made by the doctors against each committee. I rejected that argument in relation to the way in which each committee approached its task in assessing what was before it during its hearing and in the course of making its findings (see Ho [2007] FCA 388 at [113] ). But in argument before me there was an allegation of apparent bias. The committees made substantive submissions as to why their decisions were open, on the law and the facts, and why the law was as they had contended it to be during the course of the hearing. It was this feature that caused my concern once the Hardiman point had been raised by the doctors late in the course of the hearing before me. 1 In these matters I gave judgment on 26 March 2007 ( Ho v Professional Services Review Committee No. 295 [2007] FCA 388) and made orders in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the findings of each of the committees. In my previous judgment ( Ho [2007] FCA 388 at [114] ) I invited submissions as to whether I should make additional orders in the nature of writs of prohibition prohibiting the members of each of the two committees from further constituting those committees and, secondly, whether orders in the nature of writs of mandamus ought be made requiring the fourth respondent to each proceeding to reconstitute each committee to further consider each of the administrative referrals made under s 86 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) in accordance with law.
