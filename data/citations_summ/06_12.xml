<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] ACTSC 89">(b) Apart from situations involving the conduct of investigations or the suppression of crime in general terms, police may in some situations:
(i) owe a duty of care in the same way as any other member of the community (what might be termed a "civilian" duty of care)---for instance, to drive with appropriate care (Norman v Spiers [2004] ACTCA 25 ; [2004] ACTCA 25 ; (2004) 155 ACTR 8 ; Schilling v Lenton); and
(ii) owe a duty of care to people in police custody (Howard v Jarvis; Riley); and
(iii) assume a duty of care to an identifiable person or group of persons, in which case they may be liable for negligence constituted at least by specific positive acts, and possibly more generally by acts, that result in damage to such persons (Knightley, Rigby, Gibson, Zalewski, Richards; the police admissions in Ashley are also consistent with this proposition, and in Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12 ; (2006) 150 FCR 165 , Finn J at [97] referred to several other cases in which a duty of care has been assumed or found to exist).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSCA 113">20 While latitude must be given to police in the judgments and decisions that must be made in their discharge of their common law and statutory duties to enforce the criminal law, [30] the law does not call for a stark choice between an unfettered discharge of law enforcement responsibilities and the protection of members of the public from unnecessary harm. Police do not enjoy blanket immunity from suits in negligence. [31] It has been well recognised that an officer may owe a duty of care to prevent injury to the subject of a police operation or to a third person. I should refer to a number of cases that bear some similarity to the present circumstances in which a duty was found to exist. In Knightley v Johns [32] a policeman was found to have acted negligently in performing duties regulating traffic flow following an accident; in Rigby v Chief Constable of Northamptonshire [33] police were found to have been negligent when, in a siege situation, they shot a canister of gas into a building causing the building to catch fire; and in Schilling v Lenton [34] a police officer pursuing a speeding driver was found to owe a duty of care to other motorists (as well as to the subject of the pursuit). Knightley and Rigby were cited by Lord Keith in Hill in support of the proposition that a police office may be liable in negligence for the direct results of his acts or omissions. [35]  Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire, [11] Smith v Chief Constable of Sussex Police . [12] 
 (2) Where police in the course of investigation injure the person under investigation. Brooks v Commissioner of the Metropolis, [13] Sullivan v Moody, [14] Tame v New South Wales, [15] Pinfold, Stewart v Ronalds, Rush v Commissioner of Police, [16] Cran v State of New South Wales, [17] Rickard v State of New South Wales. [18] 
 (3) Where police in the course of investigation injure the person under investigation and a family member of the person under investigation suffers indirect injury. Halech v State of South Australia, [19] State of New South Wales v Klein. 
 
 27 The appellants' submission cannot be sustained. It was recognised in Sullivan v Moody that people may be subject to a number of duties, provided they are not 'irreconcilable'. [41] While a duty of care will be denied which is inconsistent with a duty which the law imposes on police in the exercise of their powers [42] the duty of care in contemplation in Zalewski was not such a duty. It is only where the duty of care 'would give rise to inconsistent obligations' that a duty should be denied. Such inconsistency may not be present when the performance of the one duty does not of necessity require action that would create a substantial risk that the putative duty, if it existed, would be infringed. </sentence>

Constables' duties concerning crime extend to collecting evidence concerning crime and keeping it for as long as is necessary ( R v Lushington; ex parte Otto [1894] 1 QB 420 at 423; Betts v Stevens [1910] 1 KB 1 at 7; Ludwig v Public Trustee [2006] NSWSC 890 ; (2006) 170 A Crim R 460 at [53] - [55] and cases there cited), enforcing the criminal law ( R v Metropolitan Police Commissioner; ex parte Blackburn [1968] 2 QB 118 ; Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12 ; (2006) 150 FCR 165 at [91] ; Hinchcliffe v Commissioner of Police of the Australian Federal Police [2001] FCA 1747 ; (2001) 118 FCR 308 at [33] - [35]) and protecting property from criminal injury ( Glasbrook v Glamorgan Council at 277; Rice v Connolly at 419).

 "Information discovery under O 15A r 6 is significantly limited by the conditions imposed in subparas (a), (b) and (c) of that rule. Subpara (a) requires that there be reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court. While the threshold test under this subrule may be set at quite a low level (see Gull Petroleum (WA) Ltd v Tah Land Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1531 at [59] ), the test for determining whether the applicant has a reasonable cause to have the requisite belief is an objective one (see Hooper [1999] FCA 1584 ; [96 FCR 1] at [39] ).</sentence>

 [2007] SASC 240 

 

 
 Civil 

 
 JUDGE BURLEY. This is an application pursuant to r 32 of the Supreme Court Civil Rules 2006 whereby the plaintiff seeks the following order: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FCA 689">This was said to involve "bad faith" in as much as the public officer does not have an honest belief that the act is lawful. 
 
 
 His Lordship also held that recklessness as well as actual knowledge of want of power and likely harm was sufficient to show the state of mind necessary to make out the tort: "It can ... now be regarded as settled law that an act performed in reckless indifference as to the outcome is sufficient to ground the tort in its second form. "' 
 
 
 In Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12 ; (2006) 150 FCR 165 at 197 [121] Finn J said: 
 
 '... the tort can take two forms. In one form (that of "targeted malice") it must be shown that the public officer in question has acted as such with an actual intent to cause injury to a person or persons. In its alternate form it must be shown either that the officer has actual knowledge both that his or her action was beyond power and would cause or be likely to cause injury or else that the officer has acted with reckless indifference both to the possibility his or her action was beyond power and to the possibility that that action would cause or be likely to cause injury...' 
 
 
 My understanding is that the applicant has abandoned any allegation that the respondent committed the tort of misfeasance in public office.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] VCC 306"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FCA 69">126 That concession, I think, also has been rightly made. In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 , McHugh and Gummow JJ said at [67] that McHugh J's dissenting judgment in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 , in which he said that administrative decision makers must accord parties procedural fairness including bringing to that party's attention the issue on which the decision is likely to turn so as to allow the party to deal with it, meant that there was no need for any doctrine of legitimate expectation and should be accepted as representing the law of Australia. See also Hayne J at [121] and Callinan J at [148]. For the reasons given by Finn J in Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12 , the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is not presently part of Australian law. I need, therefore, say no more about the 'other way' of putting the estoppel argument.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2006] FCA 286">25 The duty of the Fifth Respondent is to enforce the law. He or she must take steps to post police officers so that crimes may be detected and that honest citizens may go about their affairs in peace. But the Commissioner is not the servant of anyone save the law itself. Although the Commissioner is answerable to the law, there are nevertheless many fields in which the Commissioner will have a discretion with which the law will not interfere. It is for the Commissioner to decide in any particular case whether enquiries should be pursued. It must be for the Commissioner to decide on the disposition of the force and concentration of the resources available on any particular crime or area. No Court can or should give the Commissioner direction on such a matter (per Emmett J in O'Malley at [7], per Lord Denning MR in Blackburn at 136 and per Finn J in Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12 at [91] ).</sentence>
