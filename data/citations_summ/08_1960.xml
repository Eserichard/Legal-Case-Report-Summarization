<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] WASCA 32">14 The respondents said that this principle arises out of a consideration of the difference between the appellant who has lost at trial, but who 'has had his day in court', and a plaintiff prior to trial. The respondents, in this regard, referred principally to Tait v Bindal People [2002] FCA 322 [2] - [4], although reference is also made to Dranichnikov v Centrelink [2002] FCA 1622 [8] - [9] and [25]; Carey-Hazell v Getz Bros &amp; Co (Aust) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1334 [29] - [35]; Lawrance v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 417 [41] - [48]; 33 South Pty Ltd v Fitzgerald [2008] FCA 1960 [5] - [7]; and Clack v Collins (No 1) [2010] FCA 513 [8] - [12] and [28] - [31]. The respondents also referred, in support of their proposition, to cases involving applications for security for costs at first instance under the relevant corporations legislation: Westralian Gold Mines Ltd v Westralian Minerals &amp; Drilling Pty Ltd (in liq) (1986) 4 ACLC 167 ; and SAS Global Forrestdale Pty Ltd v Samsera Pty Ltd [2010] WASC 309 [52] - [55].</sentence>
