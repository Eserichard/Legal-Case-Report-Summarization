<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 537">The relevant inquiry is whether it is 'appropriate'. Some examples of decisions in which it was considered appropriate were SZKJI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1193 , SZFSV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1860 and Man Chi Christine Chung v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Migration Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 1317. In SZKJI , Gyles J referred the appeal to the Full Bench because a previous Full Bench decision had been brought into question as a result of changes in the Act and subsequent decisions of other judges of the Federal Court. In those circumstances his Honour considered that the Full Bench decision needed to be reviewed and the appropriate mechanism was by way of another Full Bench decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 856">In my view, the Tribunal was correct in finding that the first applicant was lawfully notified of the cancellation decision and that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction because the second review application was not made within the prescribed time period. The Tribunal has no discretion to extend that time period. I have, on a number of occasions, criticised that lack of discretion [1] . However, I would have to add that in this case, even if the Tribunal had had a discretion, it is difficult to see how it could have exercised it favourably after a delay of five years. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 505">I note that in relation to the Migration Review Tribunal, the Full Federal Court is considering a challenge to the time limit imposed by regulation on the Migration Review Tribunal: Man Chi Christine Chung v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1317.</sentence>
