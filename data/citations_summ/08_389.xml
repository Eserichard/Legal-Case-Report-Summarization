<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 480">In matters such as the present, as I have noted, it is commonplace for the Court to decide the issue of principle between the parties, leaving it to them to then agree upon the consequential detailed calculations. The final determination of the issue of principle may operate only as an interlocutory judgment, as it does not finally dispose of all issues in the proceeding. It is akin to the separate determination of a question under O 29 of the Federal Court Rules , where an order recording such a determination may give rise to an appeal by leave under s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). However, s 853(2) of the WR Act provides that it is not necessary to obtain leave to appeal under s 853(1), and s 853(2) has consequently been held to prevail over the requirement for leave: Citigroup Pty Ltd v Mason [2008] FCA 389 ; (2008) 167 FCR 217 at [32] - [33]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1525">5 The issue of whether particular orders were interlocutory, in a case similar to the present, was considered recently by Branson J in Citigroup Pty Ltd v Mason [2008] FCA 389 ; (2008) 167 FCR 217. The circumstances in Citigroup were as follows. The respondent (Mr Mason) had instituted proceedings in the District Court of New South Wales claiming unpaid leave entitlements as well as orders imposing a penalty on the appellant. Although the respondent was successful in his claim for unpaid leave entitlements and judgment was given in his favour, the District Court stood over for further hearing the issue of whether it was appropriate to impose a penalty on the appellant in all the circumstances. Nevertheless, the appellant appealed under s 853 of the WR Act to the Federal Court in respect of the District Court's judgment ordering payment of respondent's unpaid annual leave entitlements. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 171">This may have been because the respondent took the view that s 853(2) of the WR Act overrides s 24(1A). Section 853(2), provides that it is not necessary to obtain the leave of the Court, or the court appealed from, in relation to an appeal under s 853(1) , (for this purpose an appeal from a judgment of a court of a State in a matter arising under the WR Act). That view would accord with the judgment of Branson J in Citigroup Pty Ltd v Mason [2008] FCA 389 (2008) 167 FCR 217 , especially at [32]-[33]. In that case, her Honour held that s 853(2) prevails over s 24(1A), so that leave to appeal is unnecessary for an appeal from a court of a State under s 853(1) of the WR Act, even if the appeal is from an interlocutory judgment. It appears that neither party to that case argued the contrary proposition.</sentence>
