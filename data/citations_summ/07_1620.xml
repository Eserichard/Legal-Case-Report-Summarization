<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 529">The background to and nature of the privilege against self-incrimination and the penalty privilege are discussed in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 ; (2007) 164 FCR 32. Justice Finkelstein, at [7], makes it clear that the privilege operates to excuse a person from being compelled to answer any question or produce any document if doing so would have the tendency to expose a person either directly or indirectly to a penalty. His Honour at [11] makes the point that the circumstances in which penalty privilege may be claimed are not settled, but notes that it may prevent a plaintiff obtaining an order for discovery of documents or the administration of interrogatories. His Honour accepts, however, that the privilege has a wider scope and may operate to prevent an order being made for the provision of witness statements or for the production of documents on subpoena. By reference to Refrigerated Express Lines (Australasia) Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation (1979) 42 FLR 204 at 207-208, per Deane J, his Honour plainly accepted that the privilege operates to prevent a plaintiff obtaining any information that will assist in establishing the defendant's liability to a penalty. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 368">The circumstances in which the penalty privilege and a related privilege against self-incrimination have come to be recognised as part of the law of Australia by the High Court of Australia and applied in practical settings, are discussed in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 ; (2007) 164 FCR 32 by Finkelstein J, and may, for present purposes, be outlined as follows: a corporation cannot claim the benefit of penalty privilege or self-incrimination privilege: see [5]; each privilege operates to excuse a person from being compelled to answer any question or produce any document if doing so would have the tendency in one case to expose that person either directly or indirectly to a criminal charge and in the other to a penalty. While often said to be analogous and based on the same rationale, the privileges are quite distinct. The privilege in self-incrimination is deeply ingrained in the common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] TASFC 6">16 Common informer proceedings for a monetary exaction were inevitably statute based, and the cases I have read on monetary penalties and other monetary recoveries also have a statutory basis. Monetary penalty examples include: R v Associated Northern Collieries (supra), which involved an action to recover penalties under the provision of the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906 (Cth); Refrigerated Express Lines Australasia Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation (supra) where the proceedings put the respondents at risk of being held liable for pecuniary penalties in later proceedings under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth); Trade Practices Commission v Abbco Iceworks Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1279 ; (1994) 52 FCR 96 , where the proceedings directly exposed the respondents to pecuniary penalties under the Trade Practices Act ; Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 ; (2007) 164 FCR 32 , where the proceedings exposed the respondent to pecuniary penalties under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth); and Harris v Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd (1978) 45 FLR 469 , Gapes v Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd (No 2) [1979] FCA 62 ; (1979) 38 FLR 431 , and Birrell (supra), where in each case the applicant sought the imposition of a penalty against the respondent pursuant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth). Examples in relation to monetary recoveries based on a statute include: Jones v Jones (1889) 22 QBD 425 , where a statute entitled the plaintiff to triple damages for a pound breach and the rescue of items which had been distrained, it was held that triple damages amounted to a penalty; Hobbs &amp; Co v Hudson (1890) 25 QBD 232 , where a statute entitled the plaintiff to double the value of goods fraudulently removed by a tenant, it was held that the claim was a penal action; and Saunders v Wiel [1892] 2 QB 18 , where a statute provided for the forfeiture of an amount not exceeding a specified sum of money in the event of a copyright infringement, it was held that this was a penalty. That a statute provides the basis for a claim for a monetary exaction does not necessarily mean that the claim is for a penalty. In Adams v Batley (1887) 18 QBD 625 , it was held that a claim for an amount of not less than a sum fixed by statute for the infringement of a musical copyright was not a claim for penalty. Similarly, in Richmark Camera Services Inc v Neilson-Hordell Ltd [1981] FSR 413 , it was held as to a claim in England for conversion damages pursuant to the Copyright Act 1956 that it was not a claim for a penalty, albeit that the damages were calculated without regard to the actual damage suffered by the copyright owner. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 863">Although the argument over the admission of Ms Martin's affidavit was framed in terms of the privilege against self-incrimination, where the relevant peril confronting a respondent is the imposition of a civil penalty the privilege which may apply is the privilege against self-exposure to penalty. The privilege against self-exposure to penalty permits a natural person who is party to civil proceedings to resist providing proof against him or herself and bears some similarity to the privilege against self-incrimination: Rich v ASIC at 141 [23]; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 ; (2007) 164 FCR 32 at 36 [7] ; cf Reid v Howard at 12. Halsbury's Laws of Australia describes those privileges in the following terms: A natural person is not bound to answer any question or produce any document if the answer or the document would have the tendency to expose that person to the imposition of a civil penalty or to conviction for a crime. (para [195-7405]) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] TASSC 24">34 "Penalty privilege" is the shorthand expression for the privilege against self-exposure to penalty. It "operates to excuse a person from being compelled to answer any question or produce any document, if doing so would have a tendency to expose that person, either directly or indirectly, to a penalty"; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group [2007] FCA 1620 ; (2007) 164 FCR 32 at [7] . In that sense, its operation is similar to the privilege against self-incrimination, as previously discussed. However, penalty privilege is not a substantive rule of law, but merely a procedural rule: Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42 ; (2004) 220 CLR 129 at [24] , [129].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 135">It was submitted by counsel for the Fair Work Ombudsman that the failure of Mr Magar's solicitor on 20 October 2009 and 11 December 2009 to seek this clarification meant that it was now too late for alternative directions to be sought. It was, as I understand it, also submitted that the conduct of the solicitor amounted to a waiver of Mr Magar's right to present evidence-in-chief other than by way of filing affidavits filed in accordance with the timetable which permitted this, and I was referred to the judgment of Finkelstein J in Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 ; (2007) 164 FCR 32 , in particular at paragraphs [18] --- [25]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 1071">I note however that as the proceeding involved the potential imposition of penalties on Mr Zarfati, while he might not be relieved from any obligation to file a defence, as Finkelstein J stated in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd and Others (2007) 164 FCR 32 ; [2007] FCA 1620 at [12] : ... In Daniels Corporation 213 CLR at 559 Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said that penalty privilege "serves the purpose of ensuring that those who allege criminality or other illegal conduct should prove it". That is, the plaintiff must prove his case without any assistance from the defendant: Abbco Iceworks 52 FCR at 129; Rich 220 CLR at 142. So it has been held that although in a civil action a defendant is required to deliver a defence he cannot be compelled to make any admissions in relation to the matters alleged against him. That is, penalty privilege operates to relieve a defendant from the need to deliver a defence that complies with the pleading rules if the rules would override the privilege. To the extent that pleading rules purport to impose such an obligation they must give way to the privilege: Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2005) 146 IR 106 at 111-112; A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2005] FCA 1658 ; (2005) 226 ALR 247 at 251. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 1174">It was also submitted on behalf of Mr Watson that the privilege against self-incrimination has a role to play in related civil cases. In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 ; (2007) 164 FCR 32 at [9] (p 36), Finkelstein J said: 
 
 In the case of self-incrimination privilege the defendant must establish that the provision of information or the production of documents in the civil case leads to a real and appreciable risk of a criminal prosecution before the privilege can be invoked: Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation v Westinghouse Electric Corporation [1978] AC 547 at 574; Rank Film Distributors Ltd v Video Information Centre [1982] AC 380 at 392; Sorby 152 CLR at 290, 294. That will not be difficult to show when, as here, the proceeding is aimed at proving that the directors engaged in conduct which would establish, or go a long way toward establishing, that they had also committed criminal acts.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] NSWSC 225">15 There is no doubt that the affidavits and witness statements were prepared for the dominant purpose of use by the first plaintiff in litigation then pending. At common law, communications between a party or its solicitor and a witness for the dominant purpose of use in or in relation to pending or anticipated litigation are privileged ( Trade Practices Commission v Sterling [1979] FCA 33 ; (1979) 36 FLR 244 at 246 [4] ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 ; 164 FCR 32 at 41-42 [27] ). In Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 , Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ said (at 64 [35]):
 

 
 
 " Legal professional privilege (or client legal privilege) protects the confidentiality of certain communications made in connection with giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services, including representation in proceedings in a court. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] VSC 473">84 The defendants submit that very little weight should be given to any prima facie entitlement of ASIC to have the action tried in the ordinary course of the procedure and business of the court, by reason of the nature of these proceedings. First, it is said that civil penalty proceedings are of a fundamentally different nature to ordinary civil cases. It is said there is an "inherent distinction between a civil action to prevent or redress a civil injury on the one hand and a civil action to recover a penalty on the other. In the latter case, the whole and avowed object of the proceeding is the infliction of the penalty. " [149] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] VSC 322">24 It is clear that the privilege against self-incrimination may be waived expressly. [10] However, although there are statements that the privilege may be the subject of implied waiver, [11] these statements have been doubted. [12] As will appear, it is unnecessary to determine whether, or to what extent, the privilege against self-incrimination can be the subject of implied waiver. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] VSCA 157">[8] 
12 Be that as it may, and this is a question central to this appeal, it is abundantly clear that the actual directions made by Judge Bowman did not require the appellant within the time fixed thereby to file a statement of his own evidence or any other document unless he had by that stage formed the intention to rely upon any such statement or document. Finkelstein J observed that the penalty privilege would operate to prevent an order being made for the provision of witness statements [7] and also expressed the view that a defendant in such a case should not be required to plead a positive case (if any) until the plaintiff's case was concluded. 11 More recently, the Federal Court canvassed similar issues in a civil penalty proceeding [6] and came to similar conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 952">1 These are civil proceedings in which penalties are sought: s 1331 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Corporations Act "). They have been the subject of previous interlocutory decisions: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 ; (2007) 164 FCR 32 at [1] (" ASIC No. 1 ") at [1] and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 951 (" ASIC No. 2 ") at [5]. Those reasons for decision adequately describe the nature of the proceedings.  10 After the defences were filed, two issues arose - whether penalty privilege or privilege against self incrimination would ordinarily relieve the directors from any obligation to provide further details of their defence and, secondly, assuming the privileges could be relied upon, whether the directors had waived, in whole or in part, their right to assert either privilege by filing detailed defences. Those applications were heard and determined by Finkelstein J: see ASIC No. 1 [2007] FCA 1620 ; (2007) 164 FCR 32 at [1] . In those reasons for decision, Finkelstein J described the content of the defences filed by the directors and the position of MPG in the following terms (at [5]):
 When going into the detail they did in their respective defences the directors were mindful of penalty privilege. Each of their defences opens with a statement that the director "claims and reserves his right to claim penalty privilege in the proceeding. " No such statement was made by MPG for it is accepted that a corporation cannot claim the benefit of penalty privilege (Trade Practices Commission v Abbco Iceworks Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1279 ; (1994) 52 FCR 96) or self-incrimination privilege (see Environment Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd ... [1993] HCA 74 ; (1993) 178 CLR 477). That MPG cannot claim the benefit of either privilege may not be of much assistance to ASIC if it successfully attacks the company's defence. If MPG's defence is defective and it is required to provide further information, it may not be able to satisfy that requirement if the only source of its information is the director defendants and they are entitled to remain silent. (Emphasis added). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FCA 951">7 Thirdly, the privilege against self-incrimination and penalty privilege, referred to as the basis for the application for a stay, apply to Frost and Revelins, not MPG: ASIC v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 at [5] . Consistent with that principle:
 
 (1) a corporate defendant (such as MPG) may be required to provide documents and information which may tend to incriminate its officers: Trade Practices Commission v Abbco Iceworks Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1279 ; (1994) 52 FCR 96 at 116;
 
 (2) a corporate defendant cannot invoke privilege on the grounds that an order or requirement to produce documents or information might tend to incriminate a natural person, such as a director: Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 at [32] - [33] (per Lindgren J) and ASIC v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 at [5] ;
 
 (3) a natural person cannot complain that a corporate defendant's compliance with an order or requirement to produce documents or information might tend to incriminate him or her: Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 at [32] - [33] (per Lindgren J) and ASIC v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 at [5] ;
 
 (4) the relevant enquiry is whether an order directed to the corporate defendant will require that a natural person tend to incriminate himself or herself: Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 at [32] - [33] (per Lindgren J) and ASIC v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 at [5] . No submission has been made to that effect;
 
 (5) a corporate defendant cannot refuse to comply with a direction for the filing of evidence on the basis that its evidence may incriminate other natural person defendants or expose them to a penalty: Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Camile Trading Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1256 ; (2004) 58 ATR 163 at 170. However, a corporate defendant will not breach such a direction if it fails to file a statement or an affidavit from a witness where that witness claims privilege: ACCC v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd (1997) 77 FCR 217 at 220 and ACCC v Eurong Beach Resort Ltd [2005] FCA 1134 at [10] , [12] and [13]. That is to say, compliance is not required if the only source of the information is the director defendants and they are entitled to remain silent (Emphasis added): ASIC v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 at [5] . If the corporate defendant has other sources of information available from which it can comply with the direction, then it must do so.
  1 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Limited [2007] FCA 1620 at [1] , Finkelstein J described these proceedings in the following terms:
 
 
 In this action, which is still in its interlocutory phase, the plaintiff, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission seeks various forms of relief in respect of alleged contraventions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The defendants are Mining Projects Group Limited (MPG), a minerals exploration company, and two of its directors, Mr Frost and Mr Revelins. ASIC contends that in breach of s 1041H MPG made misleading public announcements about the mineralisation and exploration potential for uranium mining at Niue Island in the South Pacific. 7 Thirdly, the privilege against self-incrimination and penalty privilege, referred to as the basis for the application for a stay, apply to Frost and Revelins, not MPG: ASIC v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 at [5] . Consistent with that principle:
 
 (1) a corporate defendant (such as MPG) may be required to provide documents and information which may tend to incriminate its officers: Trade Practices Commission v Abbco Iceworks Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1279 ; (1994) 52 FCR 96 at 116;
 
 (2) a corporate defendant cannot invoke privilege on the grounds that an order or requirement to produce documents or information might tend to incriminate a natural person, such as a director: Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 at [32] - [33] (per Lindgren J) and ASIC v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 at [5] ;
 
 (3) a natural person cannot complain that a corporate defendant's compliance with an order or requirement to produce documents or information might tend to incriminate him or her: Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 at [32] - [33] (per Lindgren J) and ASIC v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 at [5] ;
 
 (4) the relevant enquiry is whether an order directed to the corporate defendant will require that a natural person tend to incriminate himself or herself: Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 at [32] - [33] (per Lindgren J) and ASIC v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 at [5] . No submission has been made to that effect;
 
 (5) a corporate defendant cannot refuse to comply with a direction for the filing of evidence on the basis that its evidence may incriminate other natural person defendants or expose them to a penalty: Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Camile Trading Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1256 ; (2004) 58 ATR 163 at 170. However, a corporate defendant will not breach such a direction if it fails to file a statement or an affidavit from a witness where that witness claims privilege: ACCC v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd (1997) 77 FCR 217 at 220 and ACCC v Eurong Beach Resort Ltd [2005] FCA 1134 at [10] , [12] and [13]. That is to say, compliance is not required if the only source of the information is the director defendants and they are entitled to remain silent (Emphasis added): ASIC v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 at [5] . If the corporate defendant has other sources of information available from which it can comply with the direction, then it must do so.
