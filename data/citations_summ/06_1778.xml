<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 849">Broadly speaking, those grounds of opposition were first, that it was not established that their respective 'claims', if they had any 'claims' for the purpose of s 33C FCA had sufficient commonality. Secondly, there was not at present a justiciable controversy between Group B franchisees and Allphones. The latter contention was and is based on the submission that as the right of franchise renewal of Group B franchisees falls on a date in the future, it is uncertain whether or not, when the time comes for renewal, the Group B franchisees will have a right to renew their franchise agreements, will exercise the right to renew them, and if they do so, then in what form may seek to renew them (cf Horn v Australian Electoral Commission [2006] FCA 1778). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1827">In that regard I also take into account some of the unchallenged background to his concerns. I refer to the following passages in his affidavit sworn on 21 November 2007:
 
 
 6. I have not brought these proceedings, the prior proceedings giving rise to the decision of Justice Nicholson ( Horn v Australian Electoral Commission [2006] FCA 1778) , or any of my related complaints and concerns communicated to the Respondent, lightly. I am pursuing these grievances in the forum that I sincerely consider to be appropriate because the sanctity of the secret ballot is to me, such an indispensable part of a proper and fair system of representative democracy that I can see no other alternative. To properly explain the importance of this issue to me, it is necessary for me to say some more about my background, beyond the matters contained in my earlier affidavit. 
 

4 In 2006 Mr Horn instituted proceedings in this Court seeking relief against the Commission in respect of this alleged non-compliance with the Electoral Act . The proceedings were heard by Justice Nicholson who dismissed them on 19 December 2006 ( Horn v Australian Electoral Commission [2006] FCA 1778). In the initial proceedings two issues were raised. The first was whether there were reasonable prospects of success in arguing that non-compliance had occurred. The second issue was whether or not there was a justiciable controversy. The question was whether Mr Horn at that particular time held a sufficient material interest in the subject matter of the action such as to warrant the grant of the relief claimed. </sentence>
