<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] WASC 230">29 The first question of relevance to the exercise of the discretion to re-open to admit new or further evidence is why the evidence was not called at the hearing and in particular whether a deliberate decision was made not to call the evidence at the hearing. It would be unfair to permit an unsuccessful party that had made a deliberate decision as a tactical matter that has failed, to re-open its case. On the other hand, in Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 Kenny J said at [24]:
 
 The authorities indicate that, broadly speaking, there are four recognised classes of case in which a court may grant leave to re-open, although these classes overlap and are not exhaustive. These four classes are (1) fresh evidence ( Hughes v Hill [1937] SASR 285 at 287; Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [No 2] [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 108 ALR 55 at 61-2); (2) inadvertent error ( Brown v Petranker (1991) 22 NSWLR 717 at 728 (application to recall a witness); Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 at 614 (application to tender answers to interrogatories): Henning v Lynch [1974] 2 NSWLR 254 at 259 (application to re-open); (3) mistaken apprehension of the facts ( Urban Transport Authority of NSW v NWEISER (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 ('UTA') at 478; and (4) mistaken apprehension of the law (UTA at 478). In every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application for leave to re-open; see UTA at 478; also The Silver Fox Company Pty Ltd as Trustee for the Baker Family Trust v Lenard's Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1310 ('Silver Fox') at [22] and [25]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] VSCA 267">13 His Honour said that the court had a discretion to allow a party to reopen its case before or after judgment had been given and that the overriding principle was the interests of justice. He said that an application to reopen could be based on accident, mistake or want of foresight and also referred to a Federal Court decision [2] in which Kenny J referred to four principal classes of case in which a court may grant leave to reopen: fresh evidence, inadvertent error, mistaken apprehension of the facts, and mistaken apprehension of the law. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 986">The Minister's submission that he should be permitted to re-open was based on the principles outlined by Kenny J in Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at [24] , which are, in summary: fresh evidence, inadvertent error, mistaken apprehension of the facts and mistaken apprehension of the law. In every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application for leave to re-open. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FCA 813">The Court has the power to grant leave for further evidence to be adduced after the trial of the proceeding has concluded and judgment reserved, fresh evidence being one of the four recognised classes of case in which a court may grant leave to re-open: Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at [24] . Kenny J stated in Bradshaw , at [24] and [26] that in every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application for leave to re-open. Kenny J referred to Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 in which Muirhead J held, at 613-614, that fresh evidence should only be admitted when: (a) it is so material that the interests of justice require it; (b) the evidence if believed would most probably affect the result; (c) the evidence could not by reasonable diligence have been discovered before; (d) inadvertence was established; and (e) no prejudice was suffered by the other party by reason of its introduction at a late point in time. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] FMCA 592">There are many authorities in relation to reopening cases in the area of civil litigation. It is not in dispute that leave may be given (see Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22) where there is fresh evidence, an inadvertent error or a mistaken apprehension of the facts or of the law. The overriding principle is clear: it is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application for leave to re-open. </sentence>

 THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES 
 
 111 The Court has a discretion to allow a party to re-open its case before or after judgment has been given. [99] The overriding principle that guides a court in exercising its discretion in deciding whether to grant an application to re-open is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application, as the case may be. [100] An application to re-open may be based on accident, mistake or want of foresight. [101] 
112 Justice Kenny of the Federal Court of Australia says there are, "broadly speaking,.... four recognised classes of case in which a court may grant leave to reopen although these classes overlap and are not exhaustive": fresh evidence; inadvertent error; mistaken apprehension of the facts; and mistaken apprehension of the law. [102] An important factor for the Court to consider is the reason or explanation for the evidence now sought to be led not being led at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2011] FMCA 408">The Minister also makes reference to a number of authorities as to the nature of further evidence that may be received after judgment has been reserved ( Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Ltd (No.2) [2008] FCA 1761 at [12] --- [15], Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Lee v Professional Services Review Committee No 292 (No 2) [2010] FCA 1490 at [2] , BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 389 at [10] , McLaughlin v Dungowan Manly Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 89 at [45] --- [56], Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436). </sentence>

8. In Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technology Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1761 , Collier J (at [15]) added: 
 
 
 15 To that list can be added: 
 
 it is necessary that the evidence sought to be adduced is relevant within the meaning of s 56 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and is of probative value (cf Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2006] NSWSC 826 at [18] ); and the court must be conscious of the principle of finality of litigation in deciding whether to exercise discretion to allow evidence after the conclusion of the trial ( Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at [25] ). 9. As can be seen, such an application is not automatically granted. 6. This would require the re-opening of the plaintiff's case. The court, of course, has power to grant leave for further evidence-in-chief to be adduced, even after trial: Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 176 CLR 256 (at 266-7). There are, as Kenny J pointed out in Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 (at [24]), four recognised classes where a court may grant leave to re-open; one of these is for the adducing of fresh evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FCA 1490">The proceedings before her Honour concerned an issue relating to the infringement or the alleged infringement of the applicant's registered trademark and alleged misleading and deceptive conduct and matters of that kind. On the question of the principles governing the question of whether or not leave to reopen should be granted, her Honour said: It is not in dispute that the Court has the power to grant leave for further evidence-in-chief to be adduced after the trial of the proceeding has concluded and judgment reserved. Indeed this jurisdiction is well recognised: Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 , Gulf Pacific Pty Ltd v Londish [1992] FCA 502 , Urban Transport Authority of New South Wales v Nweiser (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 , Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 176 CLR 256 , McCarthy v McIntyre [2000] FCA 1250 , Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010. In Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Kenny J conveniently summarised the circumstances in which the Court will permit further evidence to be adduced between conclusion of the hearing and delivery of judgment as follows:
 
 
 
 
 [24] The authorities indicate that, broadly speaking, there are four recognised classes of case in which a court may grant leave to re-open, although these classes overlap and are not exhaustive. These four classes are (1) fresh evidence ( Hughes v Hill [1937] SASR 285 at 287; Smith v New South Wales Bar Assn [No 2] [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 108 ALR 55 at 61---2); (2) inadvertent error ( Brown v Petranker (1991) 22 NSWLR 717 at 728 (application to recall a witness); Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 at 614 (application to tender answers to interrogatories); Henning v Lynch [1974] 2 NSWLR 254 at 259 (application to re-open); (3) mistaken apprehension of the facts ( Urban Transport Authority of NSW v NWEISER (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 (" UTA ") at 478; and (4) mistaken apprehension of the law ( UTA at 478). On the question of the principles governing the question of whether or not leave to reopen should be granted, her Honour said: It is not in dispute that the Court has the power to grant leave for further evidence-in-chief to be adduced after the trial of the proceeding has concluded and judgment reserved.

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2010] FamCA 810">The written submissions emphasised the necessity to carefully evaluate an application for leave and re-opening of a case within the recognised categories of fresh evidence, inadvertent error, mistaken apprehension of the facts or as to law. It was strongly asserted that mere reliance upon the justice of the case was both inappropriate and insufficient and did not address the various necessary legal steps established by previous reported decisions such as Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 ; Watson v Metropolitan (Perth) Passenger Transport Trust (1965) WAR 88 ; Gelley and Gelley (No. 1) (1992) 15 FamLR 747 and Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw (2006) FCA 22 (at paragraph 24). I have subsequently analysed each of these, and other reported cases, relied upon in oral submissions in determining the proper orders in these proceedings.  In Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 Kenny J, in an application to re-open in bankruptcy proceedings stated that:

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT TENNENT J 
 16 April 2010 

 1 In July 2009, I commenced a trial in what were effectively third party proceedings. In those proceedings, a company, Renkon Pty Ltd, and its directors sued their former solicitors in negligence. For the purpose of these reasons, I will describe the company and its directors as "the plaintiffs" and the solicitors as "the defendants". 
 
 24 In Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Kenny J in the Victorian Registry of the Federal Court of Australia, dealt with an application to re-open in circumstances where a judgment had been delivered and the applicants had taken a deliberate course of action in relation to certain evidence. Her Honour declined to give leave and identified, at par28, what she described as weightier factors militating against a grant of leave. She identified these as follows:
 
 
 "(1) 
 
 The applicants deliberately chose not to quantify the Commonwealth's loss at the first hearing, perhaps because they believed that they could not do so (see their letter of 27 August 2004) or for some other reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2010] FMCA 153">The Court has the power to grant leave for further evidence in chief to be produced after the trial of the proceedings has concluded and while the judgment is reserved. In Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 Muirhead J set out tests he determined were applicable to applications for reopening where fresh evidence sought to be admitted. These included whether the evidence was so material that the interests of justice required that it be admitted, whether the evidence, if believed, would have affected the result, and whether the evidence could not have by reasonable diligence, been discovered before: Gulf Pacific Pty Ltd v Londish [1992] FCA 502 , Urban Transport Authority of NSW v Nweiser (1992) 28 NSW LR 471 , Smith v New South Wales Bar Association (1992) 176 CLR 256 , McCartney v McIntyre [2000] FCA 1250 , Inspector --- General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010.  In Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 Her Honour Kenny J at [24] summarises the circumstances in which a Court will permit further evidence to be adduced after the conclusion of the hearing and while the matter is reserved. [24] The authorities indicate that, broadly speaking, there are four recognised classes of case in which a court may grant leave to re-open, although these classes overlap and are not exhaustive. These four classes are (1) fresh evidence (Hughes v Hill [1937] SASR 285 at 287; Smith v New South Wales Bar Assn [No 2] [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 108 ALR 55 at 61---2); (2) inadvertent error (Brown v Petranker (1991) 22 NSWLR 717 at 728 (application to recall a witness); Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 at 614 (application to tender answers to interrogatories); Henning v Lynch [1974] 2 NSWLR 254 at 259 (application to re-open); (3) mistaken apprehension of the facts (Urban Transport Authority of NSW v NWEISER (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 ("UTA") at 478; and (4) mistaken apprehension of the law (UTA at 478). In every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application for leave to re-open: see UTA at 478; also The Silver Fox Co Pty Ltd as Trustee for the Baker Family Trust v Lenard's Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1310 ("Silver Fox") at [22] and [25].

50 In Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Kenny J (at [24]), reiterated that the principle enunciated by Clarke JA in Nweiser (at 478) is the overriding principle in this regard, noted that, broadly speaking, the authorities had indicated there were four recognised classes of case in which a court might grant leave to reopen although those classes overlapped and were not exhaustive; those being where there is fresh evidence; where there has been inadvertent error; where there has been a mistaken apprehension of facts; and where there has been a mistaken apprehension of the law. The current application falls squarely within the first of those categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2010] ACTSC 5">I was referred by counsel to a number of authorities on the issue of when leave should be granted to reopen a case after the conclusion of the trial: Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 per Muirhead J; Smith v NSW Bar Association [1992] HCA 36 ; [1992] 176 CLR 256 ; Hines Exports Pty Ltd v Mediterranean Shipping Company SA [2001] SASC 311 ; (2001) 80 SASR 268 ; Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 per Kenny J; Evans v R (2007) 82 ALJR 250; [2007] HCA 59. Generally these were cases where the Court refused to allow the case to be reopened to introduce fresh evidence but made it clear that the fresh evidence would have made no difference anyway. I have not been taken to an authority where a Court refused to admit fresh evidence which appeared likely to lead to a different outcome at trial. Fortunately I am not required to proceed down that path in the present action. For the reasons I have already explained, the fresh evidence sought to be introduced if I had permitted the hearing to be reopened would have made no difference. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] ACTSC 170">
 
 87. Einstein J had occasion recently to consider the principles relating to an application to re-open in The Movie Network Channels Pty Ltd v Optus Vision Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 132. His Honour helpfully set out some principles (at [4] to [8]) as follows: 
 
 
 [4] In every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application to re-open [ Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at [24] ; Urban Transport Authority of NSW v Nweiser (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 at 478]. An application to re-open is subject to various degrees of scrutiny depending on the stage of the proceedings when the application is made. The test of what is 'just' at this stage of the proceedings is akin to the considerations applicable where leave to rely on fresh evidence is sought on appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2009] FCA 389">In order to have the affidavit of Mr Watts sworn on 14 April 2009 (including the annexures to that affidavit) admitted into evidence, Mr Watts would need to show either that the evidentiary material set out in that affidavit comprised facts and matters which had arisen after the hearing or which were not known to him or could not have been ascertained by him by the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the hearing took place on 10 December 2008 and that it is in the interests of justice that the material be admitted into evidence (see The Movie Network Channels Pty Ltd v Optus Vision Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 132 at [4] ---[8]; Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at [24] ; and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2006] NSWSC 826 ; (2006) 235 ALR 587 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 414 at [18] ). One of the important considerations to be weighed in the interests of justice in the present case is the public interest in the finality of litigation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2009] NSWSC 244"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2009] NSWSC 132">4 In every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application to re-open [ Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at [24] ; Urban Transport Authority of NSW v Nweiser (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 at 478]. An application to re-open is subject to various degrees of scrutiny depending on the stage of the proceedings when the application is made. The test of what is 'just' at this stage of the proceedings is akin to the considerations applicable where leave to rely on fresh evidence is sought on appeal. That is, the evidence must be credible, highly probative and not previously obtainable by reasonable diligence [ Jesseron Holdings Pty Ltd v Middle East Trading Consultants Pty Ltd (No 2) (1994) 122 ALR 717 at 719 per Young J; Ritchies at [51.51.50]; Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (WA Branch); ex parte Ferguson (1986) 67 ALR 491 at 493 --- 494 per Toohey J; Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 ; Betts v Whittingslowe (No 1) [1944] SASR 163 ; Hughes v Hill [1937] SASR 285 ; Watson v Metropolitan (Perth) Passenger Transport Trust [1965] WAR 88]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2009] FCA 82">In Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at para 24, Kenny J, with respect, offers a very helpful summary of circumstances in which a court will permit further evidence to be given. Her Honour lists four categories in which she opines that, broadly speaking, a court may grant leave to reopen. Her Honour is careful to note that these classes or categories are not exhaustive and overlap. The four classes that her Honour identifies by reference to authority are: 
(a) fresh evidence;
 
(b) inadvertent error;
 
(c) mistaken apprehension of the facts; and 
 
(d) mistaken apprehension of the law. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2008] FCA 1761">12 It is not in dispute that the Court has the power to grant leave for further evidence-in-chief to be adduced after the trial of the proceeding has concluded and judgment reserved. Indeed this jurisdiction is well recognised: Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 , Gulf Pacific Pty Ltd v Londish [1992] FCA 502 , Urban Transport Authority of New South Wales v Nweiser (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 , Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 176 CLR 256 , McCarthy v McIntyre [2000] FCA 1250 , Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010.  15 To that list can be added:
 
&#8226; it is necessary that the evidence sought to be adduced is relevant within the meaning of s 56 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and is of probative value (cf Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2006] NSWSC 826 at [18] ); and
 
&#8226; the court must be conscious of the principle of finality of litigation in deciding whether to exercise discretion to allow evidence after the conclusion of the trial ( Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at [25] ).
  13 In Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Kenny J conveniently summarised the circumstances in which the Court will permit further evidence to be adduced between conclusion of the hearing and delivery of judgment as follows:
 [24] The authorities indicate that, broadly speaking, there are four recognised classes of case in which a court may grant leave to re-open, although these classes overlap and are not exhaustive. These four classes are (1) fresh evidence (Hughes v Hill [1937] SASR 285 at 287; Smith v New South Wales Bar Assn [No 2] [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 108 ALR 55 at 61---2); (2) inadvertent error (Brown v Petranker (1991) 22 NSWLR 717 at 728 (application to recall a witness); Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 at 614 (application to tender answers to interrogatories); Henning v Lynch [1974] 2 NSWLR 254 at 259 (application to re-open); (3) mistaken apprehension of the facts (Urban Transport Authority of NSW v NWEISER (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 ("UTA") at 478; and (4) mistaken apprehension of the law (UTA at 478). In every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application for leave to re-open: see UTA at 478; also The Silver Fox Co Pty Ltd as Trustee for the Baker Family Trust v Lenard's Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1310 ("Silver Fox") at [22] and [25]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] FCA 1436">208 The ultimate question for the Court is whether it is in the interests of justice that the further evidence be admitted (see, for example, Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at [24] ; Daniel v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 849 ; (2004) 138 FCR 254 ( Daniel ) at 269; Urban Transit Authority of NSW v Nweiser (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 at 478-479 (per Clarke JA, Mahoney &amp; Meagher JJA agreeing); Dumitrov v SC Johnson and Son Superannuation Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 42 at [7] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2007] FCA 307">21 There is no doubt that the Court has a discretion, in the interests of justice, to order that Mr Bulic's case should be reopened so that he can adduce further evidence and advance further argument: see Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at [24] . The availability of "fresh evidence" will, in some circumstances, warrant the reopening of a case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2006] FCA 383">6 At the second hearing, the respondents' primary submission, which I ultimately accepted, was that the applicants should not be permitted to reopen their case to prove the quantum of loss: see Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 ( Bradshaw 2) at [28]. Accordingly, I made the declarations sought by the applicants but their application of 12 August 2004 was otherwise dismissed. The issue of costs now falls for determination.
