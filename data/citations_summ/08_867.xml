<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] WASCA 19">59 The easement which is implied by law from the conveyance or demise of real property by reference to the maxim of non-derogation is a legal interest under the general law: Parramore v Duggan (649). Because it is implied in the grant, it is not merely a covenant enforceable in equity: Cable v Bryant [1908] 1 Ch 259 , 264; Dabbs v Seaman [1925] HCA 26 ; (1925) 36 CLR 538 , 550 - 551; JLCS Pty Ltd v Loft City Steakhouse Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 867 [329 - [31]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 8">2 There was a subsequent action about the duration of the licence: JLCS Pty Ltd v Squires Loft City Steakhouse Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 867. When the original action was heard the Goldie Place restaurant was owned by Squires Loft City Steakhouse Pty Ltd (SLCS), a company whose directors were Harold and Saul. The company held the business in its capacity as trustee of the Squires Loft City Steakhouse Unit Trust. Subsequently, there was a change in both the directorship of SLCS, and in the beneficial ownership of the business. This, it was said, caused the licence to terminate. </sentence>
