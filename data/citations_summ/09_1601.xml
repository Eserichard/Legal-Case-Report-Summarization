<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1165">This is unfortunate because dealing with issues in this sequential manner is conducive to wasted time and increased costs. However, nothing in the evidence suggests a forensic or tactical decision in contrast to a focus on the immediate issues at hand at the expense of timely consideration of the overall litigation in the context, it must be said in fairness to Media Ocean, of complicated and evolving proceedings. As Media Ocean submitted, the conduct in question occurred some five months after the proceedings were commenced and evolved over the next six months, being affected in the interim by the grant and dissolution of an interlocutory injunction (see Pivotel Satellite Pty Limited v Optus Mobile Pty Limited [2009] FCA 1601 and Pivotel Satellite Pty Limited v Optus Mobile Pty Limited [2010] FCA 121). (4) Nor can it be inferred that there was any deliberate withholding of information from Optus or the Court. To the contrary, the evidence suggests the overly narrow focus which I have already identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 121">In my reasons for judgment, also given urgently on 23 December 2009, I accepted that Pivotel had established a serious question to be tried in respect of Optus's alleged breach of the competition rule ( Pivotel Satellite Pty Limited v Optus Mobile Pty Limited [2009] FCA 1601 at [22] ). </sentence>
