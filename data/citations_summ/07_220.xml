<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1037">8 Moreover, the applicant has asserted no basis on which to bring an application to set aside the orders which were made by consent by her Honour on 14 May 2008. A consent order is a contract between parties. It can be set aside as any other contract can be on ordinary principles of common law or equity and also in other exceptional circumstances: see Paino v Hofbauer (1988) 13 NSWLR 193 at 198C-F per McHugh JA (Samuels JA agreeing), 200B-F per Clarke JA; Harvey v Phillips [1956] HCA 27 ; (1956) 95 CLR 235 at 243-244 per Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ; The Food Improvers Pty Limited v BGR Corporation Pty Limited (No 4) [2007] FCA 220 ; 25 ACLC 177 at [13] per myself.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 617">26 On 28 February 2007 the primary Judge delivered reasons ('the second reasons') which related to the hearing on 19 February 2007, particularly in relation to Order 6: see The Food Improvers Pty Ltd and Anor v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors (No 4) [2007] FCA 220. As to the adoption of Order 6, his Honour said at [9]:
 
 I also made an order that the resolution of the directors of BGR made on 22 February 2006 declaring and effecting payment of the interim dividend, which I found to be oppressive, be set aside and substituted a resolution which sought to give effect to what was proposed in option B. I was of opinion that it would be too cumbersome to order meetings of BGR or its directors to take the procedural steps necessary to implement and vote for the resolution. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 413">3 In my reasons of 28 February 2007, I addressed that question: Food Improvers [2007] FCA 220 at [22] ---[24]. I referred there to what I had been told was an agreement between Triad and Cordato Partners (Services) relating to the proportions of the costs of the defence each of them was to bear to the extent that they were costs that I would apportion between the parties. I found that that agreement did not prevent the liquidator of BGR seeking to recover all of the costs of the defence previously paid by BGR which it should not have paid. I also found that each of Triad and Cordato Partners (Services) was jointly and severally liable to restore to BGR 90% of those costs. To that end I formulated the terms of Order 1 made on 28 February 2007 (the 90% costs order).  

2 As I recorded in my reasons ( Food Improvers Pty Limited v BGR Corporation Pty Limited (No 4) [2007] FCA 220 at [1] ) which I gave following the earlier delivery of reasons for granting principal relief to the plaintiffs in Food Improvers Pty Limited v BGR Corporation Pty Limited (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 , I heard argument on 14 and 19 February 2007 on matters about which I had directed there be further submissions. On 19 February 2007, I made final orders on all but two of those matters. The first outstanding matter was to determine the proportion of costs that the second defendant (Triad Health Products Group of Companies Pty Limited) and the third defendant (Cordato Partners (Services) Pty Limited) should repay to BGR. During the proceedings, BGR had paid a large amount in respect of the costs of all the defendants. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 326">BGR had paid for their legal costs of the proceedings which was part of the oppressive conduct in respect of which I granted final relief: The Food Improvers Pty Ltd v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 220.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1812">26 As I recognised in Food Improvers (No 4) [2007] FCA 220 at [18] , I was rejecting the different claims made by each side that they had made a contract for distribution of the proceeds of the sale of Main Camp Station. Instead, I sought to apply what had appeared, for a time, to have been common ground: that the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of Main Camp Station should proceed along the lines of Option B. In my opinion, to accede to the present application of Triad would be to work a radical departure from that intention as reflected, objectively, in my earlier reasons for judgment. 25 Moreover, in Food Improvers (No 4) [2007] FCA 220 at [15] - [18] I elaborated on the matters which I had in mind in relation to the dispute as to consultancy fees. I explained at [18] that I had found that Food Improvers was entitled to claim its consultancy fees in full, but that in the exercise of my discretion under s 233 of the Act the appropriate way of remedying the oppression which I found was to limit Food Improvers' entitlement to what it had sought under Option B and to distribute the balance by way of fully franked dividends. In coming to that conclusion, I was mindful that from September 2005 to February 2006 the parties had seen Option B as a fair and appropriate way in which to effect an informal dissolution of their quasi partnership. 22 In my opinion, it would have made no sense to have ordered repayment of moneys subsequently paid to Triad by way of consultancy fees for Mr Gulson's services following Mr Bax's removal as a director if part of that repayment were liable again to be disgorged by BGR or set off by Triad in satisfaction of any then subsisting entitlement of Triad to receive consultancy fees for the period from March 2001. For those reasons, I formulated the relief cognately in the orders that I made between 12 and 28 February 2007. In making the cognate orders, I sought to determine the rights of the parties, including the remedy for the oppression caused to Food Improvers and Mr Bax in the conduct of the affairs of BGR as recorded in my reasons of 28 February 2007: Food Improvers (No 4) [2007] FCA 220 at [8] - [12] in particular, in [12]. 2 I heard argument on those questions on 14 and 19 February 2007 and made further orders on the latter day. I subsequently published my reasons for making those orders on 28 February 2007: The Food Improvers Pty Ltd v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd (No 4) (2007) 25 ACLC 177 ; [2007] FCA 220. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] QSC 103">In this respect, s.51C(10) operates much as a Calderbank offer that is bettered at trial: namely, that the mere fact that the party making the offer obtains a judgment more favourable than the terms offered does not of itself inevitably demonstrate such special circumstances as would justify a departure from the ordinary basis of a costs assessment: See Crump v Equine Nutrition Systems (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 25 at [39] - [41]; Gove v. Black [2006] WASC 298 at [43] - [47]; Balderstone Hornibrook Engineering Pty Limited v Gordian Runoff Limited [2006] NSWSC 583 at [30] - [37]; Fordyce v Fordham (No 2) [2006] NSWCA 362 at [16] , [21]; Devprov v Seamark Pty Ltd [2007] QSC 31 at [4]; Westpac Banking Corporation v Commissioner of State Revenue [2004] 55 ATR 72 [2004] QSC 19 at [30] - [32]; Gretton v The Commonwealth of Australia [2007] NSWSC 149 at [11] - [17]; Food Improvers Pty Limited v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd (No 4) (2007) 25 ACLC 177 , [2007] FCA 220 at [35] ; and Grice v The State of Queensland [2005] QCA 298 at [7] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 466">1 When preparing order 1 and my reasons for judgment given on 28 February 2007 ( The Food Improvers Pty Ltd v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 220) , I overlooked that the plaintiffs had argued, as is shown in their written submissions dated 13 February 2007, that costs paid not just by BGR but the BGR group should be repaid by Triad and Cordato Services Partners. Because of my oversight I framed order 1 in terms which limited the repayment to be made to BGR of what it was out of pocket.</sentence>
