<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 886">3 The tribunal subsequently reconsidered the matter and, in a decision signed on 29 December 2005 and handed down on 12 January 2006, it again affirmed the decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection visa. The Federal Magistrates Court refused the applicant's claims for constitutional writ relief against the 2006 decision of the tribunal: SZIIG v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 1410. In that decision Scarlett FM found that the tribunal had said that the applicant's statement of events was highly implausible and it did not accept that he, being a Muslim, ever had a romantic relationship with a girl of the Hindu faith. His Honour recorded that the tribunal considered the applicant's account of events had been fabricated to support his refugee status claims. His Honour rejected the applicant's challenges to the way in which the tribunal exercised its jurisdiction in coming to those findings. His Honour dismissed the application for constitutional writ relief. Marshall J dismissed an appeal from that decision: SZIIG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 322. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 344">The matter was remitted to the second Tribunal for reconsideration. However, the delegate's decision was again affirmed on 29 December 2005: (RRT reference number No5/52333). An appeal of that decision was dismissed on 14 September 2006 by the Federal Magistrates Court: SZIIG v MIMA &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 1410. A new application to the Federal Court was dismissed on 9 March 2007: SZIIG v MIAC [2007] FCA 322. A special leave application to the High Court on 4 April 2007 was also dismissed on 15 November 2007: SZIIG v MIAC &amp; Anor [2007] HCA Trans 681. </sentence>
