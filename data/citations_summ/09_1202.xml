<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 232">There is a much shorter and clearer ground establishing my jurisdiction to set aside the sequestration order or to annul it under s.153B of the Bankruptcy Act . My finding that Mr Gabbedy lacked authority to apply for a bankruptcy notice on behalf of the company previously named TaxView Pty Ltd, and that he also lacked that company's authority to commence and proceed with the creditor's petition, have the undoubted consequence that the bankruptcy notice and the proceedings on the petition were invalid (see Australian Workers' Union v Bowen (1946) 72 CLR 575 at 583. As to the form of a solicitor's signature of a bankruptcy notice, see Trustees of the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary v Weir [2000] FCA 574 ; (2000) 98 FCR 447 at [2] - [11], de Robillard v Carver [2007] FCAFC 73 ; (2007) 159 FCR 38 at [100] - [116], and Yang v Mead [2009] FCA 1202 at [16] - [17]). Had these defects been revealed to the Court in July 2010, the Registrar would have been bound, by law, to dismiss the petition. I would similarly be bound to do this now if I exercised powers of review under s.104 of the Federal Magistrates Act , or if I reheard the matter after setting it aside under r.16.05.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 432">The reasons for the refusal of special leave were given by Heydon and Bell JJ who dealt with each of the applications. Their Honours said in each matter that there was no reason to doubt the correctness of the decision of Flick J. I referred in my earlier judgment to the decision of Flick J and his Honour's reasons for judgment in the matter of Yang v Mead [2009] FCA 1202. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 288">Ms Mead filed a notice of appeal against the orders of Barnes FM, but on 26 October 2009, Flick J dismissed the appellant's appeal and delivered reasons for his judgment, see Yang v Mead [2009] FCA 1202. Ms Mead has filed an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court against the orders of Flick J. The High Court has yet to determine the special leave application, but it is anticipated that the application will be determined within a fairly short period of time. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1160">Ms Yang challenged the bankruptcy notice in earlier proceedings in this Court [1] . That application was dismissed. Ms Yang appealed unsuccessfully against that decision to the Federal Court of Australia [2] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 1107">Ms Mead challenged the bankruptcy notice issued to her in earlier proceedings in this Court [2] . The application was dismissed with costs. Ms Mead unsuccessfully appealed against that judgment to the Federal Court of Australia [3] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 1168">Recent judgments seem to assume that the issuing of a bankruptcy notice can be sufficiently regarded as connected to the judicial process because the notice is subject to setting aside by the court, or because non-compliance will give rise to a ground for bringing a bankruptcy petition, notwithstanding that the issuing of a bankruptcy notice is an administrative and non-judicial activity. It is unnecessary for me in the present case to consider whether this assumption should be questioned, or should be related to concepts of abuse of process in administrative law. Whatever the foundations for the ground, it appears to me that recent authorities, including the two I have cited above and other cases including Watts v Adelaide Bank Limited [2009] FCA 420 , and Cavoli v Etl [2007] FCA 1191 , and Yang v Mead [2009] FCA 1202 , show that the debtor needs to be able to establish an improper motive of the creditor from evidence which demonstrates that there is no legitimate justification for the serving of a bankruptcy notice in the particular circumstances. Compelling circumstantial evidence of motive is usually required. For example, where a creditor has knowledge that a debtor is clearly solvent, is able to pay the judgment debt from his liquid resources, has made reasonable offers for payment or security, and there is no apparent commercial explanation for the serving of a bankruptcy notice, the court might in the particular context infer an improper purpose for serving a bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 1079">Mr McClymont did not submit that, if there were no defects in the procedures leading to the instructing of the solicitor, it would not have been permissible under the Bankruptcy Act for the owners corporation to authorise a solicitor to apply for the issue of the bankruptcy notice. Nor does he take any point in relation to the form in which the solicitor signed the application for the bankruptcy notice, in which he confirmed "that he or she is the creditor's authorised agent" . It is therefore unnecessary for me to describe this part of the bankruptcy notice, although I note that it appears to be in a form which has previously been upheld (see Trustees of the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary v Weir [2000] FCA 574 ; (2000) 98 FCR 447 at [2] - [11], de Robillard v Carver [2007] FCAFC 73 ; (2007) 159 FCR 38 at [100] - [116] , and Yang v Mead [2009] FCA 1202 at [16] - [17]). </sentence>
