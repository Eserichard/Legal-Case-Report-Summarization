<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1486">In O'Donoghue v Ireland [2009] FCA 618 the process was described by Barker J in the following paragraphs: 
 
 11 On 5 January 2005, the Hon Philip Maxwell Ruddock MP, Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Australia signed a Notice of Receipt of Extradition Request (Notice) under the Act addressed to the Magistrate before whom the person named in the Notice is brought. That Notice was issued by the Attorney General under subs 16(1) of the Act and stated that an extradition request had been received from Ireland in relation to the applicant for the following extradition offences: 
 

 8 counts of obtaining property by false pretences contrary to s 32(1) of the Larceny Act 1916 (Ireland). 8 counts of the alternative charge of fraudulent conversion contrary to s 20(1)(iv)(a) of the Larceny Act 1916 (Ireland);
 
 
 12 The Extradition (Ireland) Regulations made 13 March 1989 by reg 5 provides that the Act applies in relation to Ireland subject to the Treaty on Extradition (Treaty) between Australia and Ireland done at Dublin on 2 September 1985 (being the treaty a copy of the text of which is set out in the Schedule). Further, even if the Court was to conclude that the notice issued by the Attorney-General under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act on 5 January 2005 was issued before he had received an extradition request from the Republic of Ireland, the Court would have no power to order that the committal order made by Magistrate Calder be set aside. Such an order would be inconsistent with the order made by his Honour Barker J in O'Donoghue v Ireland [2009] FCA 618 that '[t]he Court determines that [the appellant] is eligible for surrender, within the meaning of subs 19(2) of the Extradition Act ...', and the dismissal of the appellant's appeal against that order by the Full Court in O'Donoghue v Ireland [2009] FCAFC 184.  Moreover, these issues were exhaustively ventilated in O'Donoghue v Ireland [2009] FCA 618 which, in turn, was upheld on review in the Full Court in O'Donoghue v Ireland [2009] FCAFC 184. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 345">Mr O'Donoghue's Application does not seek an adjournment of the proceedings. The affidavit filed on 11 January 2010 by Mr O'Donoghue [40] did inform the Court that he was being held in remand at Hakea Prison, pending the determination of extradition proceedings commenced against him by the Republic of Ireland, and that an application had been made by him to the High Court for special leave to appeal in those proceedings. [41] There is no dispute about those facts. Affidavit in support of application for adjournment --- 27 January 2010
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 184">2 On 9 June 2009 the primary judge determined that Mr O'Donoghue was eligible for surrender in relation to extradition offences within the meaning of s 19(2) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) ( the Act ): O'Donoghue v Ireland [2009] FCA 618. Those offences were eight counts of fraudulent conversion contrary to s 20(1)(iv)(a) of the Larceny Act 1916 (Ireland) ( the Larceny Act ), alternatively, eight counts of obtaining property by false pretences contrary to s 32(1) of the Larceny Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCAFC 111">13 ' Although the extradition of fugitive offenders is an executive act, it requires statutory authority ' which ' cannot be exercised "except in accordance with the laws which prescribe in detail the precautions to be taken to prevent unwarrantable interference with individual liberty" ': Vasiljkovic 227 CLR at 618 per Gleeson CJ, citing Brown v Lizars [1905] HCA 24 ; (1905) 2 CLR 837 at 852 per Griffith CJ. See also 227 CLR at 629 to 630. There is thus a need for what is said to be strict compliance with the formalities required by the Act: Prabowo v Republic of Indonesia (1995) 61 FCR 258 at 270 to 271 per Hill J; Timar v Republic of Hungary [1999] FCA 1518 at [62] per Weinberg J; Cabal v United Mexican States (No 3) [2000] FCA 1204 ; (2000) 186 ALR 188 at 240 per French J; O'Donoghue v Ireland [2009] FCA 618 at [68] per Barker J. There is no room for any presumption in favour of the executive where the liberty of a subject is concerned: Schlieske v Federal Republic of Germany (1987) 14 FCR 424 at 432 per Fox, Wilcox and Burchett JJ.</sentence>
