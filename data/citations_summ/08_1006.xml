<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1262">The parties have also referred to my decision in Freehills, in the matter of New Tel Limited (in liq) ACN 009 068 955 (No 2) [2008] FCA 1006 in which, after citing Barton, Dexcam and K Mart , the relevant considerations I identified (at [10]) were: whether the Judge considers that it is convenient to reserve the question, for example having regard to the point at which it arises, the strength of the point, because it raises unusual difficulties or because there are conflicting decisions;
 whether there are any similar authorities on the question of law; 
 whether they have been determined with the benefit of full argument; 
 the nature of the point of law to be decided, that is whether confined to a specific point of statutory interpretation; 
 costs and delay; and 
 administration of the Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1030">4 On receipt of additional evidence, on 19 June 2008 I allowed the plaintiff's application. Although there has been a further application by the examinee to set aside the order for service out of Australia and substituted service, that application has been dismissed. Argument in that application was heard on 1 July 2008. I delivered a judgment dismissing that application and declining to reserve that issue to the Full Court on 2 July 2008 ( Freehills, in the matter of New Tel Limited (in liq) ACN 009 068 955 (No 2) [2008] FCA 1006)). </sentence>
