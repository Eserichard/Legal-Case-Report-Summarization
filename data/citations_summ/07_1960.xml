 [118] In Mineralogy Pty Ltd v National Native Title Tribunal [1998] FCA 1700 , the Full Court accepted that, when this court is considering the question of costs in relation to an application for leave to discontinue proceedings pursuant to O 22 r 2(1)(d) of the Federal Court Rules , the appropriate test to apply is that which was explained by McHugh J in Ex parte Lai Qin at CLR 625; ALR 3 ---4. The Full Court held that, in most cases where there has been no trial on the merits, it is not appropriate in determining an issue of costs to make a prediction as to the outcome of the hypothetical case. That approach was followed by Rares J in Clark v ING Life Ltd [2007] FCA 1960 at [16] . See also O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1680 at [11] ---[13] (per Finn J) and J H Lever &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Maniotis (2005) 215 ALR 773 ; [2005] FCA 252 at [3] per Mansfield J. [119] In our judgment, the question of costs thrown up by the grant of leave to the trustee to discontinue the trustee's proceedings and the subsequent discontinuance of those proceedings was one which had to be determined in light of that discontinuance and having regard to the circumstances in play at the time that that discontinuance was put into effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 16">118 In Mineralogy Pty Ltd v National Native Title Tribunal [1998] FCA 1700 , the Full Court accepted that, when this Court is considering the question of costs in relation to an application for leave to discontinue proceedings pursuant to O 22 r 2(1)(d) of the Federal Court Rules , the appropriate test to apply is that which was explained by McHugh J in Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; 186 CLR 622 at 625. The Full Court held that, in most cases where there has been no trial on the merits, it is not appropriate in determining an issue of costs to make a prediction as to the outcome of the hypothetical case. That approach was followed by Rares J in Clark v ING Life Limited [2007] FCA 1960 at [16] . See also O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1680 at [11] ---[13] (per Finn J) and J H Lever &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Maniotis [2005] FCA 252 ; (2005) 215 ALR 773 at [3] (per Mansfield J). 110 At [93], his Honour noted that the Court has a discretion as to the making of an order for costs where a proceeding is discontinued. At [98], his Honour held that there was no general rule that a party who discontinues a proceeding with the leave of the Court pursuant to O 22 r 2(1)(d) of the Federal Court Rules should normally pay the costs occasioned by the discontinuance. His Honour found that the appropriate order as to costs in those circumstances remains in the discretion of the Court. In the second half of [98], his Honour said:
 Where there has been no hearing on the merits and where both parties have acted reasonably, a proper exercise of the discretion may be to make no order as to costs: Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 at 625 per McHugh J. The approach there pursued by McHugh J has been accepted as an appropriate test to apply when proceedings are discontinued under O 22 r 2(1)(d): Mineralogy Pty Ltd v National Native Title Tribunal [1998] FCA 1700. It is no part of the function of the Court when a proceeding is discontinued "to make a prediction as to the outcome of a hypothetical case": Clark v ING Life Ltd [2007] FCA 1960 at [16] per Rares J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 758">As I observed in Clark v ING Life Ltd [2007] FCA 1960 at [16] it is not the function of the Court to make a prediction as to the outcome of a hypothetical case. Both parties urged on 30 April 2009 that the proceedings cease. At that time, the proceedings were treated by the parties as being under Pt IVA. I was not prepared to grant leave to discontinue on the scant evidence as it then stood or to exercise any power under s 33V(1). After the applicants indicated that they wished to discontinue, it was reasonable for both them and the State to have conducted themselves as they did. I am not satisfied that Mr Wotton acted unreasonably in bringing these proceedings in his own right. Mrs Wotton's position received no separate attention in any party's submissions. I am not in a position to conclude that she acted unreasonably. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1986">98 Contrary to the submission of Mr Rickus, there is no " general rule " that a party who discontinues a proceeding with the leave of the Court pursuant to O 22 r 2(1)(d) of the Federal Court Rules should normally pay the costs occasioned by the discontinuance. It may be accepted that a Court will normally allow a party to discontinue a proceeding if he wants to, provided no injustice will be caused to his opponent. " It is not desirable that a plaintiff should be compelled to litigate against his will ": O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1680 at [11] per Finn J. But there is no " general rule ", such as suggested on behalf of Mr Rickus, and the order as to costs remains in the discretion of the Court: Smith v Airservices Australia [2005] FCA 997 at [39] , [2005] FCA 997 ; 146 FCR 37 at 48 per Stone J. Where there has been no hearing on the merits and where both parties have acted reasonably, a proper exercise of the discretion may be to make no order as to costs: Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin (1997) 186 CLR 622 at 625 per McHugh J. The approach there pursued by McHugh J has been accepted as an appropriate test to apply when proceedings are discontinued under O 22 r 2(1)(d): Mineralogy Pty Ltd v National Native Title Tribunal [1998] FCA 1700. It is no part of the function of the Court when a proceeding is discontinued " to make a prediction as to the outcome of a hypothetical case ": Clark v ING Life Ltd [2007] FCA 1960 at [16] per Rares J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 872">20 Where leave is sought to discontinue proceedings pursuant to O 22, r 2(1)(d), the question as to who should bear the costs falls to be determined under s 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act : Clark v ING Life Ltd [2007] FCA 1960 at [16] ---[17] per Rares J. Where such leave is sought, it is not the function of the Court to make a prediction as to the outcome.</sentence>
