<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 604">That being the case, in circumstances where Mr James has negligible assets in Australia I have concluded that he should provide security. That conclusion then raises the question of the quantum of security which should be provided. That there is no basis to conclude that the United Kingdom will recognise and enforce the orders of this Court leads to the consequence that this matter can be distinguished from cases such as Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs [1984] FCA 89 ; [1984] FCA 89 ; (1984) 2 FCR 463 and Soh v Commonwealth of Australia [2006] FCA 575 where the countries in which each of those applicants resided recognised orders of the Federal Court under international arrangements of reciprocity. In both those cases, it was held that the respondents had no valid claim to be put in a position better than if the applicant in question were present in Australia, making the relevant question in those cases what costs a successful respondent would incur in enforcing a costs order because it might have to be enforced overseas. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 304"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] SASC 337">The rationale behind the power to order security for costs against a party overseas is that the other party, if successful in obtaining an order for costs, should not be put to the substantial expense and delay in recovering those costs by having to enforce the order overseas. Such difficulties are one fact to be weighed by the Court in the exercise of the discretion: Limberis (above) at [33]. There is a line of cases where security has been ordered against overseas parties, but it has been limited to the costs likely to be incurred in enforcing the costs order overseas: Connop v Varena Pty Ltd [1984] 1 NSWLR 71 ; Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 54 ALR 586 ; Southern Cross Commodities Pty Ltd v Martin , 3 October 1985, Judgment No 8546; Bethune v London Properties Ltd [1990] 1 WLR 562 ; Shackles v The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd [1996] VicRp 76 ; [1996] 2 VR 427 ; Soh v The Commonwealth [2006] FCA 575 ; (2006) 231 ALR 425. As far as I am aware all of the cases in which such a limited security has been ordered are cases where there have been reciprocal arrangements in place between Australia and the overseas country in question which enabled an Australian judgment for costs to be registered and enforced in a superior Court of the overseas country. The United States of America is not a country proclaimed for the registration of judgments under either the South Australian Foreign Judgments Act 1971 or the Commonwealth Foreign Judgments Act 1991 .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 1321">As Madgwick J said in Soh v Commonwealth [2006] FCA 575 at [30] "[i]f a party seeks security for costs it is reasonable for the Court to insist that at least the best practicable efforts at estimation of the relevant costs be made". The second respondents' general and largely unsupported estimate is not sufficient for this purpose. </sentence>
