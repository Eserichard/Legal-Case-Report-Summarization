 Full Court: Debelle, Sulan and Vanstone JJ 
 
 DEBELLE J: This is an appeal from a Master of this court granting leave to the plaintiff pursuant to s 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to commence proceedings in the name of IPA Holdings Pty Ltd (in liquidation).  There has been some debate whether ss 236 and 237 apply to a company in liquidation. The view that they do not has been expressed in BL &amp; GY International Co Ltd v Hypec Electronics Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 705 ; (2001) 164 FLR 268 ; HPM Pty Ltd v Fear [2002] WASCA 249 ; (2002) 171 FLR 12 and in Promaco Conventions Pty Ltd v Dedline Printing Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 586 ; (2007) 159 FCR 486. The view that they do has been expressed in Roach v Winnote Pty Ltd (in liq) [2001] NSWSC 822 ; Brightwell v RFB Holdings Pty Ltd (in liq) (2003) 171 FLR 464 ; Charlton v Barber (supra); Kamper v Applied Soil Technology Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 891 ; (2004) 211 ALR 337 ; Carpenter v Pioneer Park Pty Ltd (in liq) (supra); Mhanna v Sovereign Capital Ltd [2004] FCA 1040 ; Scuteri v Lofthouse [2006] VSC 317 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 327. In Mhanna , Hely J said that the weight of authority favours the view that leave may be granted where the company is in liquidation. However, it is unnecessary for this court to enter into that debate since there is another route to the conclusion that Ragless should have leave to bring these proceedings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] NSWCA 52">99 However, there are a number of decisions that originally or more lately have taken a contrary view and have either upheld or suggested in obiter that Pt 2F.1A does not apply to a company in liquidation: B L &amp; G Y International Co Ltd v Hypec Electronics Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 705 ; (2001) 164 FLR 268 ; HPM Pty Ltd v Fear [2002] WASCA 249 ; (2002) 171 FLR 12 ; Promaco Conventions Pty Ltd v Dedline Printing Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 586 ; (2007) 159 FCR 486. </sentence>
