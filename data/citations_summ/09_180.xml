<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1466">I dealt with the position in relation to proxy voting deeds in Re People Telecom Limited [2009] FCA 180 at [7] --- [8], although in that case the proxy deeds were given in favour of a person other than the acquirer of the shares. Here the voting agreements are with the company that will acquire the shares if the Acquisition Scheme is approved. </sentence>

18 On the basis of these and other decisions about preliminary options to purchase ( Re CCI Holdings Ltd [2007] FCA 832 , Re Bolsini Gold NL [2007] FCA 1668 and Re People Telecom Ltd [2009] FCA 180) , as well as cases about preliminary arrangements to secure favourable voting by influential shareholders ( Re Telewest Communications plc [2004] EWHC 924 ; [2004] BCC 342 ; Re Depfa Bank plc [2007] IEHC 463) , it was submitted that the court should not have any concern about the possibility that Marley should be considered as constituting a class distinct from all other Scheme Shareholders.

 27 The evidence is that the amount of the break fee is a genuine estimate of the costs reasonably incurred by Asia Pacific Healthcare as a result of entering into the scheme arrangement. [17] The amount of the fee is around the limit of the level of fees that the Takeovers Panel generally regards as not anti-competitive. [18] There is, in any event, a carve out from the obligation to pay all or part of the break fee if it is unlawful or involves a breach of directors' duties. [19] Furthermore, the break fee is not payable if the shareholders do not vote in favour of the scheme. [20] There is, in the circumstance, a proper basis for the Court to be satisfied that the fee is unlikely to coerce shareholders into agreeing to the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] VSC 560">[25] 
17 The break fee is payable only in the circumstances contained in cl.11.3 and 11.4 of the Implementation Agreement.</sentence>
