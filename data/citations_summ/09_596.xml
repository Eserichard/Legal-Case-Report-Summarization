<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 18">In this case, the "reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review" was that information given or used as part of the assessment of the applicant's skills had been false or misleading in a material particular. The question which the applicant's allegation raises is, therefore, what did the Tribunal consider, at the time the s.359A notice was sent, was information which, unless it was persuaded to the contrary by the applicant, would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the delegate's decision that the applicant had not satisfied cl.880.230: MZYFH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2010] FCA 559 ; (2010) 188 FCR 151. The Court is to determine the question in advance of, and independently from, the Tribunal's reasoning: SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 at 1195 [17] ; and to do so objectively from the available evidence which, in appropriate cases, may include the Tribunal's reasons: SZMNP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 596 at [53] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 14">The information which the Tribunal must give to an applicant pursuant to s.359A(1) is information which, unless the Tribunal is persuaded to the contrary by the applicant, would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review: MZYFH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2010] FCA 559 ; (2010) 188 FCR 151 at 164 [64] . However, that does not require the Court to pore over all the information in the Tribunal's hands to determine which of it might possibly be considered to be dispositively relevant, even if the Tribunal did not think that it was. The Court is to determine the question objectively from the available evidence including, in appropriate cases, the Tribunal's reasons: SZMNP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 596. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 13">What is important is the subjective consideration of the Tribunal ("the Tribunal considers") in the circumstances of each case ( SZMNP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 596 at [52] to [53] per Jacobson J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 1007">It is the case that, as the High Court stated in SZBYR (at [17]), the application of s.424A(1) is to be determined in advance of and independently from the Tribunal's reasoning. However, as Jacobson J stated in SZMNP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 596 (at [38]), while the Tribunal's reasons are not the starting point " it may be appropriate to refer to them to determine whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision under review ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 181">Nor was there reliance by the Tribunal on such information in the findings and reasons part of its decision such as to support any inference that the Tribunal considered any information given by the applicant in the airport interview or in the Departmental interview would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review (see SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 and SZMNP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 596). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 935">In SZMNP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 596 at [38] , Jacobson J referred to there being " some tension in the authorities as to what use, if any, can be made of the Tribunal's written reasons in determining whether s 424A(1)(a) was enlivened ". His Honour accepted that in light of the decision in SZBYR " the question is to be determined in advance of, and independently from, the Tribunal's reasoning ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 712">In SZMNP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 596 at [52] - [53], I expressed the view that the effect of the authorities is that the word "considers" in s 424A(1)(a) is directed at the subjective consideration of the Tribunal on the facts of each case; it is for the court to determine objectively whether the Tribunal considered the information to be dispositively relevant; see also Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at [12] . </sentence>
