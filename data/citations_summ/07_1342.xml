<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1802">10 French J in Webb v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 1342 at [10] said the advice from the Registrar under s 66C cannot determine for the Court that the conditions specified in s 94C(1) and as explained in the subsequent subsections of s 94C are established as a matter of fact. Those facts are for the Court to determine. However, as in that case, the relevant events as to the filing of each of the native title determinations, the issue of the future act notices and the outcomes upon the issue of those notices were not in dispute. That is, the existence of the conditions in s 94C(1)(a), (b) and (c) are not really in issue. The Registrar's reports, of course, do not address the alternative conditions in s 94C(1)(e) of the Act.</sentence>
