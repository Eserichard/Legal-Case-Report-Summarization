<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 48">In addition to the contraventions of s 38 of the BCII Act, the applicant pointed to four cases which she said recorded contraventions of similar unlawful industrial action provisions of the WR Act by the Union where the conduct in question occurred prior to 8 March 2007; Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Construction Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 ; Cahill v Constructions, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 495 ; Temple v Powell and Cruse v Multiplex Limited [2008] FCAFC 179 ; (2008) 172 FCR 279. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1040">Section 187AB(1)(b) of the Workplace Relations Act prohibited (amongst others) an organisation from organising or engaging in, or threatening to organise or engage in, industrial action against an employer with intent to coerce an employer into making payments in relation to a period during which the employee was engaged in industrial action. Instances of prior contraventions of s 187AB are therefore potentially relevant to the present matter, because the provision concerned with coercive behaviour to bring about an outcome against the will of another. However, the circumstances disclosed in Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; 158 FCR 543 and Cruse v Multiplex Ltd [2008] FCAFC 179 ; 172 FCR 279 showed that these two cases concerned situations very different from the present. Both concerned payments for stoppages arising from a death in the industry involving breaches of ss 187AA and 187AB, including s 187AB(1)(b). Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 495 also concerned contraventions of s 187AB, including s 187AB(1)(b), arising in the context of payments for stoppages on account of safety issues. All three cases involved considerations very different to the present: see Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd 158 FCR at 562 [113]-[116] per Lander J and 576-577 [160]-[166] per Jessup J; Cruse v Multiplex Ltd 172 FCR at 294-296 [42]-[47], 300 [61] per Goldberg and Jessup JJ; and Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 495 at [38] - [43] per Marshall J.  Section 187AB(1)(b) of the Workplace Relations Act prohibited (amongst others) an organisation from organising or engaging in, or threatening to organise or engage in, industrial action against an employer with intent to coerce an employer into making payments in relation to a period during which the employee was engaged in industrial action. Instances of prior contraventions of s 187AB are therefore potentially relevant to the present matter, because the provision concerned with coercive behaviour to bring about an outcome against the will of another. However, the circumstances disclosed in Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; 158 FCR 543 and Cruse v Multiplex Ltd [2008] FCAFC 179 ; 172 FCR 279 showed that these two cases concerned situations very different from the present. Both concerned payments for stoppages arising from a death in the industry involving breaches of ss 187AA and 187AB, including s 187AB(1)(b). Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 495 also concerned contraventions of s 187AB, including s 187AB(1)(b), arising in the context of payments for stoppages on account of safety issues. All three cases involved considerations very different to the present: see Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd 158 FCR at 562 [113]-[116] per Lander J and 576-577 [160]-[166] per Jessup J; Cruse v Multiplex Ltd 172 FCR at 294-296 [42]-[47], 300 [61] per Goldberg and Jessup JJ; and Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 495 at [38] - [43] per Marshall J.  In addition to these matters, the applicant relied on various other decisions as indicative of a prior history on the Union's part. In particular, the applicant argued that the Union had a substantial history of engaging in similar conduct because it had been found to have engaged in unlawful coercion on numerous previous occasions contrary to: s 187AB(1)(b) of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth), citing Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 ; Cruse v Multiplex Ltd [2008] FCAFC 179 ; (2008) 172 FCR 279 and Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 495 ; s 170NC of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act , citing Alfred v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (Decision of Hughes J, NSW District Court, 5 March 2004); Alfred v Walter Construction Group Limited [2005] FCA 497 ; A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 1047 ; (2007) 165 IR 94 ; Cruse v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1267 ; (2008) 175 IR 447 ; and Martino v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (Magistrates Court of Victoria, 10 May 2006); s 298P of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act , citing Hadgkiss v Blevin [2004] FCA 697 ; and Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Hamberger [2003] FCAFC 38 ; (2003) 125 IR 183 ; and s 298S(2)(b) of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act , citing Alfred v Lancsar [2007] FCA 1001 ; (2007) 167 IR 320.  Further, although the conduct in question in all three cases occurred before 15 February 2006, the judicial determination of contraventions was not until some considerable time after that date: see Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1221 , Cruse v Multiplex Ltd [2007] FCA 2015 and Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 495. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 548">August 2003 Contravention of s 187AB(1)(a) and (b) of the WR Act: Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Construction Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1221 , and on appeal [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543. October 2003 Contravention of s 170 NC of the WR Act (and s 45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)): A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v CFMEU [2007] FCA 1047. May 2004: Contravention of s 187AB(1)(a) and (b) of the WR Act: Cahill v CFMEU [2008] FCA 495. October 2004: Contravention of s 170NC of the WR Act: Martino v CFMEU and Maher (unreported, Magistrates Court of Victoria, 10 May 2006). May 2005: Contravention of s 298SC(c), and s 170NC, of the WR Act: Cruse v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1267.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 158">In connection with a similar issue, in Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union [2008] FCA 495 Marshall J said at [40] that as the CFMEU was a large organisation with nationwide coverage, he did not consider that the actions of branches or officials, other than those involved in that particular matter, in respect of other provisions of industrial legislation, should be taken into account for the purposes of assessing penalty. His Honour formed a different view concerning prior contraventions of the section which was the particular subject of the proceedings before him. </sentence>
