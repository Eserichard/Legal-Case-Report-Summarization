<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1405">The well understood question to be determined in an application for leave under the broad discretion conferred by s 24(1A) is whether, in all the circumstances, the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by an appellate court and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused assuming the decision to be wrong: D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 ; SZLSI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1052 ; Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd [2000] FCA 1572 ; (2000) 104 FCR 564. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 937">The question which therefore confronts the Court now is whether leave ought be granted to appeal from what was, in form, an interlocutory judgment of the Court below. The facility to seek leave to appeal from an interlocutory order of the Federal Magistrate's Court is recognised by s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), which is a conferral of an unfettered discretion (see SZLSI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1052 , per Flick J). </sentence>
