<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1920">9 Some explanation is in order, as recent cases have demonstrated that there may be confusion as to the Court's holding: see eg Pothuwila v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1626 at [6] , where it was said, incorrectly, that the holding in Jefferson Ford was that an order granting summary judgment on all claims is interlocutory. My view in Jefferson Ford was that an order granting summary judgment, regardless of whether made against less than all parties or on less than all claims, is always final. Rares J took the opposite view, stating that an order granting summary judgment is never final. Gordon J, on the other hand, took a middle position to the effect that an order granting summary judgment is final if it disposes of all claims against all parties. In effect, then, there was a two-judge majority of Gordon J and myself for the proposition that orders granting summary judgment on all claims against all parties are final, and a two-judge majority of Rares and Gordon JJ for the proposition that orders granting summary judgment on less than all claims or against less than all parties are interlocutory. </sentence>
