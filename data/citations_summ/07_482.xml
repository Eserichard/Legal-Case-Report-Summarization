<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1411"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 661">As with any discretion, it is necessary to have regard to prejudice that might be suffered by any person as a result of orders for reinstatement and ancillary relief. It is not apparent that any prejudice would be suffered by any third party nor by the Company by these orders for reinstatement being made. While there may be some cost in being required to defend a District Court proceeding, it is not prejudice of the kind which would make it unjust to order the reinstatement of a company (see Callegher v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 482 ; (2007) 98 ALD 1 per Lander J (at [62]). If there is any prejudice it would be substantially outweighed by the prejudice to the plaintiffs in being unable to pursue the Company in respect of the alleged claims. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWSC 800">26 In Callagher and Anor v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 482 ; (2007) 239 ALR 749 , Lander J at [55] stated:
 

 
 "ACMF came to be deregistered because of the default of its direction in failing to pay an ASIC fee. It has by its director undertaken to remedy that default. ASIC does not object to the reinstatement of the registration of ACMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] WASC 185">13 To be a person aggrieved an applicant must show that deregistration deprived him of something, or injured or damaged him in a legal sense, or that he became entitled in a legal sense to regard the deregistration as a cause of dissatisfaction: see Callegher v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 482 ; (2007) 239 ALR 749. There can be no doubt that Mr Hugall falls within that category and it was not suggested otherwise on behalf of Geneva Finance. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1443">6 The function of the Court, on review of a Registrar's decision under s 35A(5) of the Federal Court Act , is to rehear the case and decide the facts for itself. It is a hearing de novo. That is to say, it is a complete rehearing at which the parties may adduce further evidence. It is for the Court to be satisfied of the matters prescribed by the Act and to exercise the discretion unfettered by the decision of the Registrar. The cases that make good those propositions include: Mazukov v University of Tasmania [2004] FCAFC 159 at [22] - [27]; and Martin v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2001) 217 ALR 634 at [6] and [12] and Callegher v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 482 ; (2007) 239 ALR 749 at [46] . </sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] NSWSC 1341">11 In Brereton v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 651 Finkelstein J held that a shareholder of a solvent company who stands to lose his or her capital has a sufficient basis for standing (at [4]), and he expressed the opinion that there was a strong argument in favour of holding that a former director of a solvent company would also have standing (at [5]), though he found it unnecessary to resolve that question. The authorities to which his Honour's attention was drawn on this point were decided in the 1980s, and his attention does not appear to have been drawn to more recent cases (see Butterworths' Australian Corporations Law: Principles and Practice (looseleaf), vol 2, [5.6.0 555], note 20) including the decision of Young CJ in Eq in Casali v Crisp , which has been followed in this and other courts ( Euphron Pty Ltd (in liq) v Hunter Valley Piggery Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 543 at [12] ; Melluish v Underwood Development Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 429 at [6] ; Warton v Harris [2005] NSWSC 1168 ; (2005) 56 ACSR 122 at [4] ; Jones v 3R Gas Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 290 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 450 at [8] ; Piccoli Tesori Pty Ltd (Deregistered); Ex parte Bertuol [2006] FCA 462 ; (2006) 151 FCR 109 at [23] ; Herbert v Nozala Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1437 at [38] ; Callegher v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 482 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 438 at [50] and [53]; Middleton Nominees Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corp [2007] FCA 845 at [6] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] NSWSC 466">50 Finally and for the sake of completeness, I mention the recent decision in Callegher v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 482 (4 April 2007). In that case, a judge of the Federal Court of Australia was called upon to review the decision of a registrar of the court to make an order under s.601AH(2). In the particular statutory context, the hearing before the judge was a hearing de novo. There was accordingly a possibility that the judge would decline to make the order that the registrar had made. In that eventuality, the result would have been the equivalent of setting aside the registrar's order. In the event, the judge decided that the registrar's decision was correct. The important distinction between that case and this is that the order made by the registrar had not been acted upon by ASIC, with the result that statutory consequences had not intervened before the review of the registrar's decision was undertaken.</sentence>
