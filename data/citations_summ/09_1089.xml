<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 704">In Anabelle Bits Pty Ltd v Fujitsu Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 1089 at [74] to [75], Graham J considered circumstances where it can be said that an act is done ' on behalf of a corporation for the purpose of s 84(2) of the TPA '. Graham J concluded that the conduct was engaged in with at least the implied consent of the directors, servants or agents of the company responsible. The fact that there was a contractual relationship between the overseas corporation and the Australian corporation of independent buyer and seller was irrelevant for the purpose of evaluating the consequences for the overseas corporation of the actor's conduct in proliferating the overseas company's brochures within Australia to potential purchasers. His Honour adopted the view expressed by Lindgren J in NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd [2000] FCA 1558 ; (2000) 107 FCR 270 at [1244] that it is sufficient if the actor engaged in the conduct intended to do so ' for ' the corporation. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1104">It is not proposed that the orders be made by consent, as Fujitsu Limited has not yet had an opportunity to consider the Court's reasons for judgment on the motion in NSD 1222 of 2007, and it may wish to appeal or seek leave to appeal from the judgment in that matter (see Anabelle Bits Pty Ltd v Fujitsu Ltd (No. 3) [2009] FCA 1089). </sentence>
