<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] WASC 94">27 The plaintiffs raised the question of whether there would be a proper contradictor to the defendants' allegations given that they are not a party to the Charge and have sought relief under the Act as a creditor of Westgem. In Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2009] FCA 131 , Finkelstein J gave the parties leave to maintain proceedings against a company that was in liquidation notwithstanding that the liquidator had no funds to conduct a defence. In relation to the claims made by Beconwood Securities against the company, his Honour observed that 'in any event, ANZ's defence of the claim against it will require it to put arguments that [the company] would rely on if it were defending the claim' [10]. The same observation can be made in this matter. The defendants' claims against Westgem are intimately connected with the claims made and relief sought by the plaintiffs. There is no doubt that the plaintiffs will contest the defendants' claims. That is confirmed by the plaintiffs' application to strike out much of the defence and counterclaim. It is also relevant that Mr Saraceni is the sole director of Westgem, was responsible for appointing the Administrator and has so far, provided him with his funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 227">In Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2009] FCA 131 at [2] - [6] his Honour succinctly outlined Beconwood's claims against the respondents to those proceedings. An examination of the outline by his Honour of the complex claims reveals that in many respects the claims are similar to the claims brought by the applicants in these proceedings. There are some differences in this application but those differences essentially are, as I perceive it, differences arising by reason of the proper legal characterisation of the relationships and circumstances arising on the evidence. Of course each applicant's position will differ to some extent but the extent to which there are common issues between not only the Beconwood proceedings and these proceedings but also proceedings in other States is very significant. The common features substantially outweigh the differences. </sentence>
