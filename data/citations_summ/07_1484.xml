<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 115">5 The learned primary judge, French J, found that the transmission of the article by the email from Mr Barry was protected by the exemption from liability for contravention of s 52 which is contained in s 65A of the Act. His Honour was of the view that there was no reasonable room for debate about the construction of s 65A which would have enabled Mr Bond and Lesotho to establish that the transmission of the article by Mr Barry fell outside the exemption granted by that section: see Bond v Barry [2007] FCA 1484 at [46] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 730">24 The applicants submit that there was a cross promotion of "enhanced reports". I infer that this expression refers to the instances of credit reports pleaded in paras 10(h)(ii) and 10(h)(iii) of the PFASOC. The enhanced reports are therefore themselves credit reports. At the hearing, counsel for the applicants attempted to explain how this promotion occurred. He seemed to suggest that the supply of the credit reports themselves was in connection with the supply, possible supply, or promotion of the supply or use, of the credit reports or "enhanced reports". The authorities stand against that analysis: Horwitz Grahame Books Pty Ltd v Performance Publications Pty Ltd (1987) 8 IPR 25 at 29; Advanced Hair Studios Pty Ltd v TVW Enterprises Ltd (1987) 18 FCR 1 at 10-11; Lovatt v Consolidated Magazines Pty Ltd (1988) 12 IPR 261 at 273; Bond v Barry [2007] FCA 1484 at [42] .</sentence>

51 The appellants rely upon the reasoning of French J in Bond v Barry [2007] FCA 1484. In that case a freelance journalist had provided material for publication by a newspaper. The issue was whether or not the communication of that draft article from the journalist to the newspaper fell within s 65A. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1664">49 Both parties referred me to several authorities in which s 65A of the TP Act has arisen for consideration: Horwitz Grahame Books Pty Ltd v Performance Publications Pty Ltd (1987) 8 IPR 25 ; Bond v Barry [2007] FCA 1484 ; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Seven Network Limited [2007] FCA 1505. None of these cases resolves the issue raised here.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1505">86 In Sun Earth at 282, Wilcox J described matter that would fall within paragraph (a) as matter concerning the applicants, published in connection with the supply of goods or services of the applicants. His Honour did not direct his observations to the argument raised here by Seven, that the supply of goods or services "of that kind" was limited to goods and services of the kind supplied by the prescribed information provider. It is worth noting however that intuitively Wilcox J considered goods or services "of that kind" as not so restricted. In Bond v Barry [2007] FCA 1484 , French J at [41]---[42] did not read subparagraph (vi)(A) as restricted to "relevant goods or services". However, it does not seem that his Honour was directed to that possible construction.</sentence>
