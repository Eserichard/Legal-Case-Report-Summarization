<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] WASCA 67">7 In November 2007, with a federal election pending, the appellant made an urgent application to the Federal Court, which was heard by McKerracher J: Horn v Australian Electoral Commission [2007] FCA 1827 ; (2007) 163 FCR 585. The applicant sought a declaration that the respondent (the AEC), which was responsible for administering the conduct of federal elections, had failed to provide polling booths for use by voters that complied with s 206 and s 233 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act . The appellant contended that the polling booths were not constructed and arranged in such a manner as to screen voters from observation while marking their ballot papers, so as to allow a voter to mark his or her vote on the ballot paper in private. 18 The grounds of appeal the appellant foreshadowed if leave to appeal were granted by McKechnie J were:
 The primary court erred in law in failing properly to apprehend the Appellant's reasons for not voting at the Commonwealth election of 24 November 2007, and accordingly in failing to make any, or any sufficient, findings of fact about those reasons in light of the statutory scheme under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) (the Act), which failures deprived the Appellant of a reasonable chance of an acquittal. 
 In particular, the primary court:
 
 
 1.1 Failed to construe, properly or at all, the statutory provisions that the Appellant reasonably contended were at material times breached by the Respondent, and/or the Executive Government of the Commonwealth, namely ss.206 and 233 (1) of the Act (which reasonable contentions of statutory breach were relevant to whether the Appellant had a valid and sufficient reason for failing to vote). 1.2 Misconstrued the Act in that it: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) wrongly approached its task of fact-finding on the basis that an elector has a 'duty' to vote, unqualified by any recognition of the range of reasons that may give rise to a 'valid and sufficient reason' for failing to vote; and

 (b) failed to recognise that a sincerely held and consistently pursued position concerning the absence of a secret ballot, including the assertion of breaches of ss.206 and 233 (1) of the Act, is capable of giving rise to such a 'valid and sufficient reason'. 
 
 
 
 
 1.3 Failed properly to make findings concerning the voting compartments tendered in evidence in light of the Appellant's contention that the compartments (which were materially the same as the compartments in use at the Commonwealth election of 24 November 2007) do not facilitate a secret ballot. 1.4 Allowed an extraneous and irrelevant matter to guide it, namely the decision of McKerracher J in Horn v Australian Electoral Commission [2007] FCA 1827 ; (2007) 163 FCR 585 , when that decision, and the factual findings of McKerracher J, did not absolve the primary court from making its own factual findings on the evidence before it as to whether the Appellant had a valid and sufficient reason for failing to vote. 1.5 Despite having initially adverted to the operation of the burden of proof, failed properly to recognise and apply the legal burden of proof on the Respondent to negative beyond reasonable doubt the existence of a valid and sufficient reason (the Appellant having met the evidential burden on him in relation to that excuse). 
 
 The primary court erred in fact in failing to find that the voting compartments in use at the Commonwealth election: 
 
 (a) were not constructed so as to screen voters from observation while they are marking their ballot papers; and

 (b) did not allow voters to, in private, mark their votes on their ballot-papers 
 
 
 or, alternatively, that an elector might reasonably reach the conclusions at (a) and (b) and thereby have a valid and sufficient reason for not voting. 20 The appellant now appeals to the Court of Appeal against the decision of McKechnie J. The grounds of appeal read:
 The learned primary Judge erred in law in failing to find that the trial Magistrate erred in failing properly to apprehend the appellant's reasons for not voting at the Commonwealth election of 24 November 2007, and accordingly failing to make any, or any sufficient, findings of fact about those reasons in light of the statutory scheme under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth), which failure deprived the appellant of a reasonable chance of acquittal; 
and in particular, erred in law in failing to find that the trial Magistrate:
 
 
 1.1 misconstrued the Act in that he: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) wrongly approached its task of fact-finding on the basis that an elector has a 'duty' to vote, unqualified by any recognition of the range of reasons that may give rise to a 'valid and sufficient reason' for failing to vote;

 (b) failed to recognise that a sincerely held and consistently pursued position concerning the absence of a secret ballot, including the assertion of breaches of ss 206(1) and 233 (1) of the Act, is capable of giving rise to such a 'valid and sufficient reason'. 
 
 
 
 
 1.2 Failed to properly make a finding concerning the voting compartments tendered in evidence in light of the appellant's contention that the compartments (which were materially the same as the compartments in use at the Commonwealth election of 2007) do not facilitate a secret ballot. 1.3 Allowed an extraneous matter, namely the decision of McKerracher J in Horn v Australian Electoral Commission [2007] FCA 1827 ; (2007) 163 FCR 585 to dictate the outcome of the proceedings before him, when that decision, and the factual findings of McKerracher J, did not absolve the trial Magistrate from making his own factual findings on the evidence before him as to whether the appellant had a valid and sufficient reason for failing to vote. 
 
 The learned primary judge erred in law in failing: 
 
 2.1 properly to make findings of fact about the voting compartments in use at the Commonwealth election in light of the appellant's reason advanced for not voting; and 

 2.2 to find that the trial Magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the voting compartments in use at the Commonwealth election: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) were not constructed so as to screen voters from observation while they are marking their ballot papers; and 

 (b) did not allow voters to, in private, mark their votes on their ballot papers 
 
 
 
or, alternatively, that an elector might reasonably reach the conclusions at (a) and (b) and thereby have a valid and sufficient reason for not voting. </sentence>

 1 McKECHNIE J : The appellant holds strong views about certain aspects of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) and its implementation, particularly where the votes are cast in secrecy. Prior to the 2007 election those views led him to take an urgent application before the Federal Court which was heard by McKerracher J and reported as Horn v Australian Electoral Commission [2007] FCA 1827. Without quoting from that decision, in short point, McKerracher J rejected the factual and legal bases that the appellant put forward and rejected them comprehensively. 6 The appellant now seeks leave to appeal with ground 1 and a foreshadowed ground 2:
 The primary court erred in law in failing properly to apprehend the Appellant's reasons for not voting at the Commonwealth election of 24 November 2007, and accordingly in failing to make any, or any sufficient, findings of fact about those reasons in light of the statutory scheme under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) (the Act), which failures deprived the Appellant of a reasonable chance of an acquittal. 
 In particular, the primary court: 
 
 
 1.1 Failed to construe, properly or at all, the statutory provisions that the Appellant reasonably contended were at material times breached by the Respondent, and/or the Executive Government of the Commonwealth, namely ss.206 and 233 (1) of the Act (which reasonable contentions of statutory breach were relevant to whether the Appellant had a valid and sufficient reason for failing to vote). 1.2 Misconstrued the Act in that it: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) wrongly approached its task of fact-finding on the basis that an elector has a 'duty' to vote, unqualified by any recognition of the range of reasons that may give rise to a 'valid and sufficient reason' for failing to vote; and

 (b) failed to recognise that a sincerely held and consistently pursued position concerning the absence of a secret ballot, including the assertion of breaches of ss.206 and 233 (1) of the Act, is capable of giving rise to such a 'valid and sufficient reason'. 
 
 
 
 
 1.3 Failed properly to make findings concerning the voting compartments tendered in evidence in light of the Appellant's contention that the compartments (which were materially the same as the compartments in use at the Commonwealth election of 24 November 2007) do not facilitate a secret ballot. 1.4 Allowed an extraneous and irrelevant matter to guide it, namely the decision of McKerracher J in Horn v Australian Electoral Commission [2007] FCA 1827 ; (2007) 163 FCR 585 , when that decision, and the factual findings of McKerracher J, did not absolve the primary court from making its own factual findings on the evidence before it as to whether the Appellant had a valid and sufficient reason for failing to vote. 1.5 Despite having initially adverted to the operation of the burden of proof, failed properly to recognise and apply the legal burden of proof on the Respondent to negative beyond reasonable doubt the existence of a valid and sufficient reason (the Appellant having met the evidential burden on him in relation to that excuse). 
 
 The primary court erred in fact in failing to find that the voting compartments in use at the Commonwealth election: 
 
 (a) were not constructed so as to screen voters from observation while they are marking their ballot papers; and

 (b) did not allow voters to, in private, mark their votes on their ballot-papers 
 
 
 or, alternatively, that an elector might reasonably reach the conclusions at (a) and (b) and thereby have a valid and sufficient reason for not voting. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 43">7 In particular, Mr Horn says that the following matters should be taken into account:
 
 (a) his success in the notice of motion, both as to the existence of a 'matter' sufficient to ground the jurisdiction of the Court under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and further, my rejection of the respondent's assertion that the proceedings were in some way brought frivolously or vexatiously;
 (b) my findings at [26] of the reasons for judgment ( Horn v Australian Electoral Commission [2007] FCA 1827) as to Mr Horn's motivation and responsible conduct of the proceedings;
 (c) the legitimate characterisation of the proceedings as being within the category of 'public interest litigation'; and
 (d) the strongly arguable nature of numerous aspects of the application's merits.
