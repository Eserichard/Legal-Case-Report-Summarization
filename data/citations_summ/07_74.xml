<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 8">1 JLCS Pty Ltd (whose directors include Lionel Miller and Joel Distiller) is the owner of the trade mark "Squires Loft". On 9 February 2007 a judge found that Lionel and Joel had granted Harold Miller and Saul Miller a licence to operate a steakhouse restaurant at Goldie Place in Melbourne, under the name "Squires Loft": Miller v JLCS Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 74 ; (2007) 158 FCR 1. The judge made a declaration to that effect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 867">9 The evidence at the first trial was that Harold and Saul operated the City restaurant through their company, SLCS. This was mentioned in the reasons for judgment on several occasions. For example when recording a number of matters that were not in dispute between the parties Sundberg J said that one of those things was "that the City restaurant was, through their company, Harold and Saul's: Miller [2007] FCA 74 ; 158 FCR 1 [42]. 15 Although a good deal of argument was devoted to the meaning and effect of the declaration it is, in my opinion, quite clear that Harold and Saul's declared right is not in any way dependent upon them being shareholders in SLCS or unit holders in the unit trust. This is so for several reasons. The first and most obvious is that the declaration makes no mention of SLCS. The second and equally important reason is that according to its terms the declaration is not concerned with the ownership of the City restaurant. The right it records is a right to "operate" the restaurant using the Squires Loft mark. The "operation" of a restaurant is something different from its ownership. Next there is Sundberg J's finding at Miller [2007] FCA 74 ; 158 FCR 1 [79] that the licence is unconditional. That is to say the right to "operate" the City restaurant using the mark is unlimited, and runs until the death of the survivor of Harold and Saul. This finding is inconsistent with the supposed limitation.  He also rejected their claim that they were joint owners of the trade mark. Sundberg J did, however, find that Harold and Saul were entitled to use the mark. During the course of his reasons Sundberg J made the following observations on this topic: Miller [2007] FCA 74 ; 158 FCR 1 [181]-[195]
 Lionel wanted to assist his father and brother establish a business. He spent a lot of time on the project. He took the lease and licence in his own name to facilitate the matter. 2 This unfortunate piece of litigation is not the first occasion upon which the parties have come to court. Indeed, the current dispute centres around what was decided in their earlier action. That action determined the rights of the parties to the trade mark "Squires Loft". The applicant, JLCS, is the owner of the mark as well as a device mark that includes the words "Squires Loft --- Steak Specialists". In the earlier action ( Miller v JLCS Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 74 ; (2007) 158 FCR 1) the trial judge, Sundberg J, granted a declaration that the respondents in that action, Harold Miller and Saul Miller (father and son), "are entitled to operate the City restaurant under the name Squires Loft". The City restaurant is located in Goldie Place, Melbourne. The parties to this action are at odds over the meaning of the declaration. In any event, JLCS contends that, whatever be its meaning, Harold and Saul's entitlement to use the mark in the operation of the City restaurant has come to an end. 7 Earlier, at Miller [2007] FCA 74 ; 158 FCR 1 [79] Sundberg J noted:
 The fact that no restrictions were placed by Lionel and Joel upon Harold and Saul's use of the name merely means that they were at liberty to use it, unconditionally, in the City restaurant for as long as they wished. It indicates the amplitude of the agreement that was undoubtedly made, but provides no occasion for expanding it. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] SAWCT 70">11 The first difficulty with this analysis is that having found the "subcontract agreement" inoperative the learned President failed to approach the matter on the basis of what then were the terms and conditions operating between the parties. Indisputably there was an agreement between them. In Miller v JLCS Pty Ltd [108] Sundberg J ruled contracts may be inferred from the acts and conduct of the parties [109] . He then stated [110] :-
 "It has generally been accepted since the House of Lords decision in James Miller &amp; Partners Ltd v Whitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd [1970] AC 583 that while evidence of subsequent conduct is admissible to determine the existence of a contract, it is not admissible to determine the terms of a contract: see D W McLauchlan, 'Contract Formation, Contract Interpretation, and Subsequent Conduct' (2006) 25 University of Queensland Law Journal 77. This rule must be understood in its context.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] VSC 273">16 Broadtel relies on what was said in Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd, [7] as recently applied by Sundberg J in Miller v JLCS Pty Ltd. [8] In Byrne, after referring to the criteria listed in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings, [9] the High Court (Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said: 
 
"[A]s Deane J has observed, [10] the cases in which the criteria in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings have been applied in this Court are cases in which there was a formal contract, complete on its face. He pointed out that a rigid approach should be avoided in cases, such as the present, where there is no formal contract. In those cases the actual terms of the contract must first be inferred before any question of implication arises. That is to say, it is necessary to arrive at some conclusion as to the actual intention of the parties before considering any presumed or imputed intention. " [11] 
 
Their Honours then quoted the observations of Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton [12] as to the test to be applied in cases where the parties have not spelt out the full terms of their contract: [13] 
 
"[A] court should imply a term by reference to the imputed intention of the parties if, but only if, it can be seen that the implication of the particular term is necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of a contract of that nature in the circumstances of the case. " (emphasis added)</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] SAWCT 25">13 Though I have concluded the parties did not contract in the terms of the Contract Carriers Agreement (TB Vol 1 p 130, submissions tr 212), on the other hand it is indisputable that there was an agreement entered into between the parties. What then were the terms of that agreement. In Miller v JLCS Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 74 Sundberg J noted that contracts may be inferred from the acts and conduct of the parties (par [117]). He stated (par [118]):- 
 "It has generally been accepted since the House of Lords decision in James Miller &amp; Partners Ltd v Whitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd [1970] AC 583 that while evidence of subsequent conduct is admissible to determine the existence of a contract, it is not admissible to determine the terms of a contract: see D W McLauchlan, 'Contract Formation, Contract Interpretation, and Subsequent Conduct' (2006) 25 University of Queensland Law Journal 77. This rule must be understood in its context.</sentence>
