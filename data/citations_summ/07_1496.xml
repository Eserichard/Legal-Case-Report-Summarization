The detail there provided as to the " disputes " denies any substance to a submission of the Applicant that it could not meaningfully respond to the concerns being raised. There is no reason to question the concluding statement as to what had in fact been relied upon. No question, it is concluded, arises as to the delegate considering potentially further prejudicial material and there being a " subconscious influence of non-disclosed material ": Billabong Aboriginal Corporation v Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations [2007] FCA 1496 at [41] , [2007] FCA 1496 ; 100 ALD 42 at 50.
  The material, identified in the Applicant's Outline of Submissions as " extraneous documents ", was extensive. How far those " extraneous documents " fell short of requiring the delegate to disclose the entirety of his file is not known. Clearly enough, not every document need be disclosed: Billabong Aboriginal Corporation v Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations [2007] FCA 1496 , 100 ALD 42. A notice to show cause had there been issued under s 71 of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 (Cth) calling upon the applicant to show cause why an administrator should not be appointed. Declaratory and injunctive relief was sought precluding the Registrar from appointing an administrator " without first providing Billabong with access to the Registrar's entire file of documents and correspondence 'relating to the applicant' ": Billabong at [7].</sentence>
