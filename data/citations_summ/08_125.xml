<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] AATA 124">93. But does the rule in Jones v Dunkel apply in the Tribunal? Tamberlin J has answered this question in the negative. In Green v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship , [84] his Honour said:
 
" 41 Although the observation of the Tribunal at [66] concerning Mr Green's failure to call certain witnesses could be construed adversely to Mr Green's case, there is no indication that those persons could have provided material to assist his case. On the other hand, however, having regard to the fact that the Tribunal's proceedings are inquisitorial in nature and the observations in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 308 are not applicable, there is no indication in this case that any particular adverse inference was drawn or suggested on the basis of the fact that the witnesses did not give evidence orally and that the omission to ask them to do so rested with Mr Green (and not on the Tribunal). " [85]  94. Tamberlin J did not cite any authority in support of his statement that the Tribunal's proceedings are inquisitorial or offer any reason why the fact of their being inquisitorial leads to the conclusion that the principles in Jones v Dunkel are inapplicable. I note that if the applicability of the principles in Jones v Dunkel relies on the Tribunal's proceedings being adversarial and not inquisitorial, then the earlier judgment of Tamberlin J in The Tax Agents' Board of New South Wales v Martin [86] provides authority that the proceedings of the Tribunal are adversarial. So too does the judgment of Rares J in Aporo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [87] but again without any express reason. If there is a reason it is implicit in the comparison made with the proceedings of the Refugee Review Tribunal, which the High Court had found to be inquisitorial in the case of NABE v Minister for Immigration.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] AATA 106">The tribunal is also to take into account any relevant matters provided by the applicant as mitigating factors (para 2.8(a)). They should be viewed in the context of the applicant's entire record ( Green v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 125 [25]-[26]). The applicant did not explicitly raise any factors in mitigation of his record, but did mention to the tribunal and to Dr Ellis (Exhibit A5, p4) that on some occasions Tanya would assault him, on one occasion poking him in the eye, provoking him to retaliate. While that maybe so, it must be borne in mind that the applicant is a very large and strongly built man and any pugilistic encounter between him and a woman (or most other men) is likely to be unequal and to end badly for the latter. That would negate the mitigating effect of any provocation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] AATA 79">The tribunal is also to take into account any relevant matters provided by the applicant as mitigating factors (para 2.8(a)). They should be viewed in the context of the applicant's entire record ( Green v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 125 [25]-[26]). Sides J took the applicant's age into account. Mr Rajab submitted that when the applicant came to Australia at the age of 12 he had never been in any trouble but soon offended because of peer pressure and the effects of alcohol. He had been exploited by bullies. Taking those matters into account, I nevertheless find that the applicant's record is very serious. </sentence>

In this case, the applicant did not advance any mitigating factors, her basic approach being categorical denial of all guilt or wrongdoing, despite her many pleas of guilty. I note, however, in relation to her conviction for stalking or intimidating with intent to cause fear or physical or mental harm on 16 February 2006 that on appeal Blanch CJ thought the fact that it was an experienced female police officer who was the subject of the offence placed it towards the bottom end of the scale.

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCAFC 188">... 93. As the applicant pointed out, there is no evidence before the tribunal from any of the members of the working party, and the failure to call such evidence has not been explained. The Federal Court has recently held, however, that the principle in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 308 does not apply to this tribunal's proceedings, which are inquisitorial in nature: Green v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 125 at para 41. Further, the evidence as it stands is sufficient to support the conclusion that the executive summary was brought into being for the requisite purpose, and I so find. (Emphasis added)  119 It was upon the basis of this evidence that the Tribunal concluded that the copy of the Executive Summary was exempt pursuant to s 34(1)(a) and further concluded that the copy of the Executive Summary which was in the possession of the first respondent was a " copy of ... a document referred to in paragraph (a) " within the meaning of s 34(1)(c). Relevantly the Tribunal concluded:
 [89] The executive summary was part of the subject matter of the Cabinet meeting's discussions on that topic and cannot be said merely to have been placed before Cabinet for its information. The treasurer was not bringing the "issue" of criminal penalties before Cabinet in a general or abstract way, but was putting forward concrete proposals developed following a working group or "workshopping" approach that Cabinet had itself discussed and approved. Further, even though the treasurer may not have supported all the working group's recommendations as set out in the executive summary, the course of events and the language of the various communications make it highly probable that the treasurer's expressed position on the criminal penalties issue would have been structured in accordance with the recommendations in the executive summary. To that extent, it could disclose the minister's position in the manner discussed in CFMEU. ... [93] As the applicant pointed out, there is no evidence before the tribunal from any of the members of the working party, and the failure to call such evidence has not been explained. The Federal Court has recently held, however, that the principle in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 308 [1959] HCA 8 ; ; [1959] HCA 8 ; [1959] ALR 367 at 371---2 does not apply to this tribunal's proceedings, which are inquisitorial in nature: Green v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 100 ALD 346 ; [2008] FCA 125 at [41] . Further, the evidence as it stands is sufficient to support the conclusion that the executive summary was brought into being for the requisite purpose, and I so find. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FCA 1609">5 Although the decision of the Tribunal was not susceptible of appeal, original jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by s 476A(1)(b) and (2) to review the Tribunal's decision. The jurisdiction conferred is the same as that of the High Court of Australia under s 75(v) of the Constitution . In order to obtain relief in this Court's original jurisdiction, the Applicant must demonstrate jurisdictional error: Cockrell v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 160 at [4] . The Minister did not deny that a failure to consider a relevant consideration could amount to jurisdictional error (eg, Aporo v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 102 ; see also: Green v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 125 at [21] ---[29] [2008] FCA 125 ; , 100 ALD 346) ; nor was any submission advanced that a failure to comply with s 43(2B) of the 1975 Act may not constitute jurisdictional error. The submission which was advanced on behalf of the Minister was that the Tribunal had committed no error, be it jurisdictional or otherwise.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] AATA 814">Burden of proof: The applicant submitted that he bore no onus of proof and that the respondent was attempting to reverse the onus by inviting the tribunal to draw inferences from the absence of evidence adduced by the applicant. As these are disciplinary proceedings, the principle in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 applied, notwithstanding the comments of Tamberlin J in Green v Minister for immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 125 . </sentence>

Mr Johnson referred to Re Inamata and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] AATA 695 at para 91 in which I quoted some remarks of Viney J when sentencing Mr Inamata on 5 December 1994: 
 ... It has been said on authority that the fact that people commit offences when they are affected by drugs is not of itself a mitigating factor and that must be taken into account. Even so, it is fair to say that a person who commits offences when they are thus affected can be treated differently from criminals who simply use these sorts of crimes to maintain a lifestyle and are not motivated by such an outside agency (G p142). ...

The only mitigating circumstance advanced by the applicant was his disrupted and dysfunctional upbringing in Tokelau and New Zealand.

The applicant told Marien J that he had been abusing heroin, cannabis, amphetamines and alcohol on a daily basis during the three weeks preceding the 2003 offence (G p76). At the hearing of the present application, he said he had had a drugs and alcohol problem but it had not been the cause of his criminal activities. He had offended because of stress, he said, but did not elaborate. No other mitigating factors were advanced. The applicant's pattern of criminal conduct since 1983 must clearly be regarded as very serious. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] AATA 639">It is making the correct or preferable decision (taking into account the onus) not resolving a dispute associated with an assertion and a rebuttal. Although some of the considerations lying behind the rule in Jones v Dunkel will apply to proper administrative decision-making, it does not necessarily apply to administrative decision-making as a rule. Indeed, Tamberlin J in the Federal Court of Australia has recently held that it does not apply ( Green v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 125 at [41] ). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs26" from="[2008] AATA 444">While all that is true, the letter is quite credible in light of the applicant's inexperience as a bricklayer at the time and does provide some corroboration for the applicant's evidence on that point.
