<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 3">9 For reasons adverted to in the leave judgment at [19]-[22] I do not share the view expressed by Flick J that Mr Tervonen's application (to the extent it was capable of being seen as referable to s 16 of the Act) was required to be dismissed for the reasons given by Gyles J in Tervonen v Finland [2008] FCA 781. Gyles J was concerned with the operation of s 19 of the Act, rather than s 16 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 4">1 In the judgment under appeal Gyles J decided that he was bound by the judgment of the High Court in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Kainhofer (1995) 185 CLR 528 ('Kainhofer') to conclude that arguments upon which Mr Tervonen wished to rely in connection with a request by Finland for his extradition, were bound to fail ( Tervonen v Finland [2008] FCA 781). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1539">5 A Full Court which considered an appeal against the judgment of Rares J decided on 6 March 2008 that the amended notice of 30 April 2007 was substantially valid ( Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24) and also, as a consequence, upheld the appeal against the judgment of Gyles J ( The Republic of Finland v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 25). That matter was remitted to Gyles J for further consideration. Gyles J subsequently confirmed the magistrate's order of 6 June 2007 save in respect of certain offences omitted from the amended notice under s 16 as a result of the order of the Full Court which found that notice substantially, but not entirely, valid ( Tervonen v Finland [2008] FCA 781). The latest decision of Gyles J is subject to appeal. The appeal is listed for hearing in November 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1133">11 This was an argument which, it would appear, held some favour with His Honour Justice Gyles in Tervonen v Finland [2008] FCA 781. His Honour there observed: 
 Warrant for arrest? [8] Tervonen puts authentication of the warrants in issue but also takes a point of substance.</sentence>
