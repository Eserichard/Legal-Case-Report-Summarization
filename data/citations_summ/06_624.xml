<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 701">The applicant submits that the delay resulted from administrative failures which caused the termination notice dated 10 February 2010 to not be received when it was apparently originally sent and that once he learned of the termination of his complaint he acted expeditiously to file an application with the Court. Further, by reference to what Cowdroy J said in Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 624 ; (2006) 151 FCR 524 , the applicant submitted that the only period relevant for consideration of prejudice is the period following the expiry of the period prescribed by s.46PO(2) and that the minor delay in filing his application could not have been the cause of any prejudice to the respondents. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 100">It is also necessary to consider any prejudice to the respondent arising from the delay, bearing in mind that in this case the delay in issue is the delay in filing the application. In that respect it is relevant to have regard to Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Ltd (2006) 151 FCR 524 ; [2006] FCA 624 , in which Cowdroy J pointed out that he had " not been referred to any authority in which a court ha [d] taken into account prejudice caused by delay prior to the commencement of the prescribed period " (at [17]), and that the only relevant period for consideration of prejudice was the time following the expiration of the prescribed period and prior to the filing of the application. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] AATA 967">This approach was adopted by McInnis FM in Phillips v Australian Girls' Choir and Another [2001] FMCA 109 where the Federal Magistrate said it is clear that this principle referred to by Wilcox J in the Hunter Valley case needs to be modified so that it is no longer regarded as law that an applicant has to show an acceptable explanation for delay, or that it is fair and equitable in the circumstances to extend time, as a pre-condition to the exercise of discretion in favour of the applicant. The Federal Magistrate's approach was endorsed by Cowdroy J in Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 624 ; (2006) 151 FCR 524 and more recently in Budd v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1540. According to McInnis FM, the principles which should be regarded when determining whether to grant an extension of time are as follows: There is no onus of proof upon an applicant for extension of time though an application has to be made. Special circumstances need not be shown, but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied it is proper to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 1325">However, the mere absence of prejudice was not enough to justify the grant of an extension. Importantly, he added that the merits of the substantial application were properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted. In Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 624 , Cowdroy J held (at [12]) that those principles were relevant to an application under s 46PO. I am of the same view.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 869">28 The issue of prejudice in the context of cases involving an application for extension of time was recently discussed by Cowdroy J in Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 624 at par 16. His Honour referred to comments of Bray CJ in Lovett v Le Gall (1975) 10 SASR 479: 
 
 'If the defendant has suffered no prejudice, as when he was well aware within the limitation period of the plaintiff's claim, or where the excess period of time is small, or where he cannot show that he has lost anything by reason of the delay, it may well be that the court will not find it difficult to come to the conclusion that it is fair and equitable in the circumstances to grant the extension. ' (at 485) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 812">19 The discretion of the Court conferred by the words 'or within such further time as the court concerned allows' appearing in s 46PO(2) HREOC Act is similar to the discretion given to the Court in s 11(1) Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (' ADJR Act '). Principles applicable to the exercise of the discretion under s 46PO(2) were described by McInnis FM in Phillips v Australian Girls Choir [2001] FMCA 109 , based in turn on principles formulated by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348 in relation to s11 ADJR Act . These considerations articulated in Phillips have been applied in a number of Federal Court decisions including Pham , Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Limited [2005] FCA 1541 (Jacobsen J) and Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Limited [2006] FCA 624 (Cowdroy J), and are relevant in the case before me. The principles listed by McInnis FM are as follows:
 
 1. There is no onus of proof upon an applicant for extension of time though an application has to be made.</sentence>
