<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 14">BRIT conceded at first instance that it had taken adverse action against Mr Barclay in three respects, namely by suspending him from duty, suspending his access to the internet and requiring him not to attend the premises of BRIT. The fourth form of adverse action alleged was requiring Mr Barclay to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him. This was not conceded and the primary judge did not determine whether it was adverse action. His Honour did refer to a conflict of authority on the question whether being liable to investigation or disciplinary proceedings can constitute a sufficient alteration of the position of an employee to that employee's prejudice to amount to adverse action. The relevant authorities are: Kimpton v Minister for Education of Victoria (1996) 65 IR 317 ; United Firefighters' Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board [2003] FCA 480 (2003) 198 ALR 466 at [89] ; Police Federation of Australia v Nixon [2008] FCA 467 (2008) 168 FCR 340 at [46] - [48]; and Jones v Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre Ltd [2009] FCA 1382 at [23] - [27]. It would also be necessary to consider whether, even if requiring an employee to respond to disciplinary proceedings does not amount to adverse action, it might constitute threatening to take adverse action which, by virtue of s 342(2)(a) of the Fair Work Act , is itself adverse action. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 399">This claim is somewhat confusing because it seeks to introduce concepts of causation into the question of whether or not adverse action has been taken, although it also apparently seeks to directly address the issues raised by Ryan J in Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340. In any event however, I am satisfied that, in the circumstances of the case, the investigation was commenced in circumstances where QTAC had reasonable or adequate cause. I am not satisfied that QTAC knew or ought to have known that the complaints against Ms Jones were not bona fide but were made in the context of her role or responsibility and/or participation in the enterprise agreement negotiations. Accordingly I do not consider that the commencement of the investigation into the complaints against Ms Jones constituted adverse action against her.  It is not in dispute that a failure by an organisation to deal with workplace bullying may lead to breaches of workplace health and safety laws and potential prosecution of the organisation by Workplace Health and Safety authorities. Such an outcome was, for example, adverted to in Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340.  The question whether the commencement of an investigation constitutes adverse action was specifically considered by Goldberg J in United Firefighters Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board [2003] FCA 480 ; (2003) 198 ALR 466 , North J in Kimpton v Minister for Education of Victoria (1996) 65 IR 317 and Ryan J in Police Federation of Australia v Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340.  In Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 the relevant employees also sought interlocutory injunctions against the employer, claiming inter alia that the resumption of an investigation of bullying allegations against an employee constituted an injury or alteration of position against that employee, for reasons prohibited by the relevant legislation. Ryan J observed: 
 
 It was argued on behalf of the respondents that to be subject to a disciplinary investigation does not amount to an injury in employment or an alteration of the position of an employee to his or her prejudice ... 
 

 
 
 In the light of the history which I have just recounted, I consider that a serious question remains as to whether the resumption of the inquiry by Biggin and Cartwright amounts to an injury to Mullett in his employment. Not every disciplinary inquiry or investigation of alleged misconduct by an employee will have that effect. For example, the inquiry may be conducted in such a way that only the affected employee and a few other persons directly involved in it are aware that it is taking place. Likewise, the subject matter or particulars of the alleged breach of discipline may, on balance, not be reasonably capable, at least before the investigation has been completed, of damaging the reputation of the employee or adversely affecting his or her standing in the workforce or among the wider community, assuming the fact of the inquiry to be so widely known. 
 

 
 
 However, the investigation within Victoria Police of the Bullying Allegations against Mullett cannot, on the evidence as it stands, be regarded as similarly innocuous.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 315">I have previously published two sets of reasons on interlocutory aspects of this application: Police Federation of Australia v Nixon [2008] FCA 467 , and Police Federation of Australia v Nixon [2008] FCA 752. I intend that the present reasons should be read in conjunction with the earlier reasons, which will obviate the need to rehearse again the factual background to the proceedings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 284">Given the concessions, properly made by BRIT in relation to the taking of adverse action, it will only be necessary to determine whether or not the institution of the disciplinary proceedings also constituted "adverse action", if it later becomes necessary to consider the award of compensation to Mr Barclay. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that three members of the Court, in the course of interlocutory judgments, have held that the commencement of disciplinary proceedings arguably amounts to the taking of adverse action: see Kimpton v Minister for Education of Victoria (1996) 65 IR 317 at 319 (per North J); United Firefighters' Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board (2003) 123 IR 86 at 110-111 (per Goldberg J); Jones v Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre Ltd (2009) FCA 1382 at [26] --- [27] (per Collier J). On the other hand, in another interlocutory judgement, Ryan J held, in Police Federation of Australia v Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 at 355-6, that the resumption of a disciplinary investigation into allegations against a police officer did not amount to an alteration of that officer's position because "alteration" required a substantive change in, or reduction of, the advantages enjoyed by the employee in that capacity. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1382">Not only had QTAC commissioned an investigation by a third party into complaints and allegations against Ms Jones in circumstances where such complaints and allegations included anonymous complaints or, in the case of allegations by Mr Williams, were allegedly driven by motives relevant to his own position, but QTAC on 6 November 2009 informed all staff of the existence of the Carol Watson report and that it intended to respond to it. While QTAC did not specifically identify Ms Jones as the subject of the report, in my view the focus of the report would have been well-known to QTAC staff. Such publicity is invariably capable of damaging the reputation of an employee or adversely affecting her standing in the organisation (cf comments of Ryan J in Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 at [42] - [43]). 5. Fifth, in her letter to Ms Jones dated 29 October 2009, Professor Terry responded in detail to issues raised in correspondence from Cooper Grace Ward on behalf of Ms Jones and concluded: 
 
 Allegations 
 

 
 
 Having considered the investigator's report and your response to that report, QTAC believes there is evidence that you have acted in a way which amounts to bullying or harassment of employees. I do not accept that a person charged is not affected in his or her employment until the charge has been proven... The laying of the charges exposes an employee of the board to a potential disadvantage in his or her employment if the charges are ultimately proven. 
 
 

 I note that a contrary view was expressed by Ryan J in Police Federation of Australia v Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 where his Honour observed that the resumption of an investigation into certain allegations against a senior police officer did not amount to an alteration of the officer's position because "alteration" in this context requires a substantive change in, or reduction of, the advantages enjoyed by the employee in that capacity. Specifically, his Honour found that: 
 
 Merely to be subject to a disciplinary inquiry or investigation does not, without more, constitute such a substantive change. (at [45]) 
 

 Mr Spry drew my attention to further comments of his Honour in Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 at [48] , namely: 
 
 I consider, with respect, that amenability to a disciplinary charge brought in good faith and on a proper prima facie evidentiary basis is a normal incident of employment and does not of itself, before the laying of the charge, constitute "an adverse affection of, or deterioration in, the advantages enjoyed by the employee" in the sense used by the High Court in the passage from Patrick Stevedores ... 
 

 In highlighting these comments of Ryan J in Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 , Mr Spry submitted that his Honour contemplated adverse action taken by an employer in circumstances where a disciplinary charge was brought other than in good faith, and contended that such was the case in relation to the commencement of the investigation against Ms Jones. In my view, placing to one side for the moment whether the commencement of the investigation constituted adverse action against Ms Jones, there is little evidence at this stage to support any claim by Ms Jones that the Carol Watson report was commissioned by QTAC other than in good faith. Indeed, as Mr Murdoch SC submitted, under the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 (Qld) QTAC is obliged to ensure the safety of its employees at work, which includes protection from workplace harassment. However it is also the case that the possible conflict of authority between Kimpton (1996) 65 IR 317 and United Firefighters [2003] FCA 480 ; (2003) 198 ALR 466 on the one hand, and Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 on the other, suggests another issue which warrants determination at a final hearing rather than at an interlocutory stage. In this case Ms Jones has established at least a sufficient likelihood of success in claiming that the commencement of the investigation by QTAC and the subsequent conduct of the investigation were prejudicial or disadvantageous to her position as an employee. Not only had QTAC commissioned an investigation by a third party into complaints and allegations against Ms Jones in circumstances where such complaints and allegations included anonymous complaints or, in the case of allegations by Mr Williams, were allegedly driven by motives relevant to his own position, but QTAC on 6 November 2009 informed all staff of the existence of the Carol Watson report and that it intended to respond to it.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 726">In that sense, I respectfully agree with the observations of Ryan J in Police Federation of Australia &amp; Anor v Nixon &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 at [69] in these terms: 
 If the effect of s 809(2) is to require an applicant to demonstrate, in the absence of any evidence at all from the respondent, a serious question to be tried as to each element of the cause of action, including the respondent's reason or reasons for the impugned conduct, the applicant may suffer irreparable damage before he or she can be accorded a final trial at which, ex hypothesi , the presumption would enable the cause of action to be made out. I consider that such a restrictive and apparently unjust interpretation should only be given to a provision which occurs in what seems to be a beneficial or facultative legislative scheme, if the language of the subsection intractably requires it. In my view, a construction more consonant with the statutory context and history and the preparatory material is that s 809(2) precludes the Court from finding, on an application for an interim or interlocutory injunction, even provisionally, by recourse solely to the presumption that the respondent's conduct was for a prescribed reason or for reasons that included a prescribed reason. However, I do not construe s 809(2) as preventing the Court, in assessing whether there is a serious issue to be tried, from having regard to the availability of the presumption in the final determination of the application. Similarly, I consider that account can be taken of the ultimate availability of the presumption when assessing the respective strengths of the case for the applicant and that for the respondent as part of exercising the general discretion to grant or withhold interlocutory relief. 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1504">29 As to the third matter, I would commence with two general observations. First, it will be sufficient if it be found that the respondent acted only partly because the employees in question proposed to engage in protected action. Secondly, the applicant's task of showing that it has a prima facie case so far as the respondent's reason for acting is concerned is somewhat simplified by the terms of s 448(8) of the Act, to which I have referred above. The operation of a similar provision, in the context of an interlocutory application, was explained by Wilcox and Cooper JJ in Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers [1999] FCA 1108 ; (1999) 91 FCR 463 , 501 [110] as follows:
 Where there is an application for interim relief in proceedings under the Division, the onus remains upon the applicant to demonstrate that there is a serious question to be tried that the dismissal occurred for a prohibited reason. If a serious question to be tried is made out in respect of the other ingredients of the alleged contravention, s 298V operates to establish there is a serious question to be tried that the dismissal was for a prohibited reason. It remains available to the employer to demonstrate at the interlocutory stage that the reason for the dismissal was other than for a prohibited reason. The weight of that evidence may be such as to persuade the court there is no serious question to be tried. Because of the absence from s 448 of a provision in the terms of s 809(2) of the Act, I am spared the complications which confronted Ryan J in Police Federation of Australia v Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 173 IR 132. </sentence>
