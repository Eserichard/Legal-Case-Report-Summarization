<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 110">As I observed in my reasons for judgment of 5 May 2009, in relation to the applicant's notice of motion filed on 17 December 2008 (see John Holland Pty Ltd v The Maritime Union of Australia [2009] FCA 437 at [41] ), it seemed clear that proceedings C2008/2281 were before Commissioner Redmond in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, in an application under s 496(1) of the Workplace Relations Act between Dempsey Australia Pty Ltd and the first respondent in these proceedings, for an order against industrial action on 3 March 2008, 5 March 2008 and 6 March 2008. 
As indicated earlier, the unlawful industrial action in which the first respondent engaged was confined to the period 3 --- 6 March 2008. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 187">73 It was common ground between the parties that s 340(2)(b) of the Act as then in force did not mandate that a meeting be held in order to enable a decision to be made by a majority 'that they want to approve the agreement' as held by Graham J in John Holland Pty Ltd v The Maritime Union of Australia [2009] FCA 437 at [19] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 750">On this third issue, the CSU contends that the words in s 340(2)(b): "persons who cast a valid vote" required Blue Star to adopt a process which ensured that only the eligible employees were able to cast a vote in the postal ballot. Of course, s 340(2)(b)(i) allows the employer to choose the manner or process by which it obtains the approval of the eligible employees to the proposed agreement: see John Holland Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [2009] FCA 437 at [19] per Graham J. In this case, consistent with this observation, Blue Star chose to conduct a postal ballot. </sentence>
