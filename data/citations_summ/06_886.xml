<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1436">In the present proceeding, three considerations (at least) warrant attention, namely: to raise on appeal grounds not previously relied upon requires the leave of the Court; the role of this Court as an appellate court and the role that this Court plays in respect to any subsequent application that may be made to appeal to the High Court of Australia; and relevant to the grant or refusal of leave are various factors, including the fact that a ground sought to be raised was previously abandoned. 
Although these three considerations may be separately identified, consideration of any one of them may well overlap with consideration of another. Each of these considerations has also been repeatedly addressed in decisions of this Court --- but some brief overview of these considerations is perhaps appropriate, lest the Appellant be left with the impression that his appeal has been dismissed on a " technicality " divorced from principle or merit. It is in that context that a fourth consideration should also be addressed, namely:
 the merit of the new grounds sought to be raised. The serious consequences that may attend a wrongful refusal of a protection visa may also be taken into account when determining whether it is expedient in the interests of justice that leave be given: SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886 at [16] per Branson J. The serious consequences that attend the refusal of leave to raise a new ground in any appeal is, however, a matter warranting careful consideration and migration cases --- it is considered --- attract no different consideration: cf SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [9] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 578">Centrally relevant to a consideration of whether leave should be given in a case such as the present are the " serious consequences that may attend a wrongful refusal of a protection visa ": SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886 at [16] per Branson J. See also: Iyer [2000] FCA 1788 at [22] per Heerey, Moore and Goldberg JJ. These cases are perhaps authority for no broader proposition than this: the importance of any litigation to any of the parties concerned is a matter to be taken into account. Why there should be any different principle applied in migration appeals than is applied in other appeals is not self-evident. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 149">7) If so, can it be justly and practicably cured? 8) If not, where, in all the circumstances, do the interests of justice lie? 

In the present statutory context it has, not surprisingly, been further concluded that:
 
 ...the serious consequences that may attend a wrongful refusal of a protection visa may be taken into account in determining whether it is expedient in the interests of justice for leave to be granted where the appellant has been legally represented at all times: SZEPN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886 at [16] per Branson J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 765">16 Only where it is expedient and in the interests of justice to do so will leave be granted to argue a ground of appeal abandoned in a lower court: see O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 at [319] ; Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at [7] . In NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [163] Madgwick J adopted the approach taken by Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ in VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [48] where their Honours said:
 
 'The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below, but which clearly has merit, is advanced, and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated. Where however there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused. ' 

This principle has been followed more recently in SZFIR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 424 and SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886.  22 The merits of the proposed ground of appeal is also a significant consideration in determining whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice to grant leave: see SZEPN [2006] FCA 886 [17] per Branson J; VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168 at [177] - [178]; IYER [2000] FCA 1788 per Heerey, Moore and Goldberg JJ at [22]-[24]; and Gomez 190 ALR at [548]. In SZCIJ [2006] FCAFC 62 the Full Court refused to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal for two reasons, one reason being that the appellant disavowed the ground sought to be raised in the Federal Magistrates Court. However the more fundamental reason was that leave to amend would be futile since the ground sought to be relied upon lacked merit.  21 Thirdly, the particular circumstances of this case are such that refusal to grant leave may lead to serious consequences for an appellant seeking asylum as considered in Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 190 ALR 543 at 548 and in SZEPN [2006] FCA 886 [16].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 624">Moreover, ground 3 of the notice of appeal raises an issue that was not argued in the Federal Magistrates Court. An appellant requires leave to rely on arguments not raised in the court below. Such leave will only be granted where it is expedient in the interests of justice for such leave to be granted: see NAIT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 per Madgwick J (with whom Conti J agreed) at [154] --- [175] (in particular at [162] and following where the issue of raising fresh issues of law is considered). One of the criteria for determining whether leave should be granted to raise a new legal argument on appeal is whether the argument has reasonable prospects of success. In some cases it may be appropriate to hear argument in full on the merits of a new legal argument in order to determine the question of whether leave should be granted to raise the new argument: see SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886 at [17] . </sentence>
