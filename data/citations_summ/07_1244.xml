<citphrase id="cp0.15" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 49">(b) is entitled to the benefit of . . . an award . . .

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 66">In relation to the onus of proof, having reviewed judgments of the Federal Court in Bahonko v Sterjov [14] and Rojas v Esselte Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) , [15] and of this Court in Buckingham v KSN Engineering Pty Ltd &amp; Anor , [16] this Court observed in Hayward v Rohd Four Pty Ltd (2008) [17] that: 34. From the above review of the authorities I conclude that the determination of this proceeding requires the following: (a) The applicant proving the fact of employment and its termination; (b) The applicant proving such of the facts as he intends to rely upon to invoke one or more of the ... [relevant] provisions ... of the Act; (c) The respondents proving that such identified reasons were not the reason, or one of the reasons, for the termination of the applicant's employment; (d) In discharging that onus the respondents do not have to prove that the applicant's employment was terminated for a valid reason, as long as it was not terminated for a proscribed reason.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 411">In Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1244 per Jessup J at [95] --- [100] the onus of proof under the preceding WR Act as follows: [95] The Applicant relies upon s 170CQ of the WR Act. At the relevant time, it provided: In any proceeding under section 170CP relating to a termination of employment in contravention of section 170CK for a reason (a proscribed reason) set out in a paragraph of subsection (2) of that section: (a) it is not necessary for the employee to prove that the termination was for a proscribed reason; but (b) it is a defence in the proceedings if the employer proves that the termination was for a reason or reasons that do not include a proscribed reason (other than a proscribed reason to which subsection 170CK(3) or (4) applies). Although it is well-established that the effect of this provision is to reverse the onus of proof on the matter of reason under s 170CK(2), there is an aspect of the operation of s 170CQ of the WR Act which has been little discussed in the cases, but which is of some importance in the present matter, largely because there is no evidence as to the Applicant's political opinion, social origin or physical or mental disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 389">Otherwise a respondent would have to devote resources to proving a negative that could never arise on the facts.

 Substantive Proceedings 
 
3 The events which give rise to the Notice of Motion have a long and complicated history. In general terms, they relate to Ms Bahonko's employment at a kindergarten operated by the first and second respondents which was managed by the third respondent ("Ms McEwan"). Ms Bahonko had been employed, on a trial basis, at La Kosta Child Care Centre &amp; Kindergarten Pty Ltd ("La Kosta") on 7 November 2005. Her employment was terminated just 4 days later on 10 November 2005 on grounds of "serious misconduct" relating to allegations of physical and psychological abuse by Ms Bahonko of children at the kindergarten and verbal abuse of other staff members, including Ms McEwan: see [2007] FCA 1244 at [3] - [8]. 4 Ms Bahonko filed two applications:
 
 (1) an application pursuant to s 170CP of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the WR Act ") (in the form it took in November 2005) alleging contraventions of ss 170CK(2) and 170CM of the WR Act and other unlawful or tortious conduct ("the WR Act application"); and
 (2) an application pursuant to s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1996 (Cth) ("the HREOC Act") alleging unlawful discrimination under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) ("the RD Act "). </sentence>

On 21 August 2007 a Deputy District Registrar of the Court wrote to the applicant as follows:
 
 "I refer to the Notice of Motion received by the court on 20 August 2007 and supporting affidavit. 
 
 I write to advise that, pursuant to Order 46 rule 7A(2) of the Federal Court Rules , I have been directed by a Judge of the Federal Court not to accept Items 1 and 2 of the Notice of Motion for filing or issuing. However, the Judge has directed that Item 3 of the Notice of Motion be accepted for filing and issuing.
