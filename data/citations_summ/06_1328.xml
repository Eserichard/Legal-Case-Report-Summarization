<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 235">Any brief of evidence prepared for internal lawyers at the BIIC office in relation to factual matters described in the Amended Statement of Claim SYG 1222 of 2007; 7. Any brief of evidence prepared for external lawyers by the BIIC Office in relation to factual matters described in the Amended Statement of Claim SYG 1222 of 2007. Second Notice to Produce (a) Original and/or copies of all documents, memoranda, reports, notes, records (including electronic records and records stored in computerised form) or any other written material describing, considering, analysing, making recommendations, or recording administrative decisions in relation to or in consequence of the Notice of Motion and decision of the Federal Court in A &amp; L Sylvestri Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v CFMEU [2006] FCA 1328. (b) Original and/or copies of all documents, memoranda, reports, notes, records (including electronic records and records stored in computerised form) or any other written material relating to or evidencing: (i) Administrative decision made to institute proceedings SYG 1222 of 2007; (ii) Counsel's brief referred to in paragraph 11 of the affidavit of Gregory Charles Alfred sworn on 28 September 2007 (the Alfred affidavit); (iii) The ABCC file which contains confidential communications between the ABCC and its legal representative referred to in paragraph 11 of the Alfred affidavit; (iv) The legal retainer between Craig Bolger of Counsel and any person acting on behalf of the office of the Australian Building &amp; Construction Commissioner; (v) The conversation between Gregory Alfred and Ross Dalgleish referred to in paragraph 19 of the Alfred affidavit; (vi) The conversation between Gregory Alfred and Ross Dalgleish referred to in paragraph 21 of the Alfred affidavit; (vii) The conversation between Gregory Alfred, Ross Dalgleish and Jodie McEwen referred to in paragraph 23 of the Alfred affidavit; (viii) The conversation between Ross Dalgleish and Craig Bolger referred to in paragraph 23 of the Alfred affidavit; (ix) The conversation between Gregory Alfred, Ross Dalgleish and Elizabeth Hayes referred to in paragraph 27 of the Alfred affidavit; (x) The brief referred to in paragraph 29 of the Alfred Affidavit; (xi) The instructions referred to in paragraph 31 of the Alfred affidavit; (xii) The request for advice referred to in paragraph 38 of the Alfred affidavit; (xiii) The advice referred to in paragraph 38 of the Alfred affidavit; (xiv) The request of Counsel referred to in paragraph 39 of the Alfred affidavit; (xv) The request of Counsel referred to in paragraph 52 of the Alfred affidavit; (xvi) The brief referred to in paragraph 55 of the Alfred affidavit; (xvii) The brief referred to in paragraph 57 of the Alfred affidavit.  That is not necessarily so. It may be clear from early events that proceedings may well be commenced and, thereafter, it is simply a matter of gathering the evidence to prosecute or meet such proceedings. The body of authorities arising out of insurance indemnity refusals is a good example of this reality, for instance, Nickmar Pty Ltd v Preservatrice Skandia Insurance Ltd (1985) 3 NSWLR 44. Further, in Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victorian Workcover Authority [2002] VSCA 59 ; (2002) 4 VR 332 the Victorian Court of Appeal expressed the view that Goldberg J's proposition in Australian Safeway Stores, referred to above at [45], was too widely stated. I also note the respondents' reference in argument to A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 1328 but am of the view that it is distinguishable from this case. </sentence>
