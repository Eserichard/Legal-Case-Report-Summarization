<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 593">The re-examination provisions were introduced following the report of the Industrial Property Advisory Committee to the Minister for Science and Technology dated 29 August 1984. The report was entitled "Patents, Innovation and Competition in Australia", and recommended the availability of re-examination "so as to utilise the expertise in the Patent Office to decide appropriate questions in the hope that this may reduce the costs of, or in some cases avoid the need for, court proceedings": see the report as quoted in Emperor Sports Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2005] FCA 996 ; (2005) 146 FCR 159 at 179-180 per Lindgren J and Termite Tite (NZ) No 2 Ltd v Term-Seal (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1493 ; (2007) 74 IPR 16 at 28 [50] per Besanko J. These provisions are to be read against the patent regime established under the Patents Act , including the definitions of 'novelty' and 'inventive step' in s 7 , and the related definitions of 'prior art base' and 'prior art information' in the Dictionary in Sch 1. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 95">1 This is an appeal (by leave) against a decision of Besanko J finding infringement of claims 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 9 of Australian Patent No 758879 by the appellants and dismissing a cross-claim for revocation of the patent ( Termite Tite (NZ) No 2 Ltd v Term-Seal (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 74 IPR 16 ; [2007] FCA 1493).  8 The earlier references in the judgment to the issue were as follows ( Termite Tite (NZ) No 2 Ltd 74 IPR 16 ; [2007] FCA 1493 at [68] , [69], [72] and [78]):
 
 
 "68 Dr Fredericks is an associate professor within the Faculty of Science of the Queensland University of Technology. He trained as an organic chemist and he has worked and continues to work as an analytical chemist with particular experience in spectroscopy. He was provided with the samples of the Term-Seal FRM which became exhibits in the proceedings. 13 The trial judge set out the applicable principles without error ( Termite Tite (NZ) No 2 Ltd 74 IPR 16 ; [2007] FCA 1493 at [96] ---[102]). The appellants submit that the invention claimed was anticipated by each of two prior patent specifications.
  4 The trial judge helpfully analysed the relevant claims as follows ( Termite Tite (NZ) No 2 Ltd 74 IPR 16 ; [2007] FCA 1493 at [37] ---[40]):
 "Claim 1 has the following integers: 
 
 1. A membranous termite barrier which is adapted to extend between the mortar course of a masonry wall and an adjacent concrete slab;
 2. The said membranous termite barrier comprising a matting impregnated with a termite resisting product;
 3. The said matting being sufficiently absorbent to facilitate its impregnation with the liquid termite resistant product;
 4. The said membranous termite barrier is in the form of a longitudinally extending strip which can be rolled over an upper course of the masonry wall; 7 The trial judge's finding on this aspect was as follows ( Termite Tite (NZ) No 2 Ltd 74 IPR 16 ; [2007] FCA 1493 at [82] ---[83]):
 "The second integer is that the "membranous termite barrier comprises a matting impregnated with a termite resisting product". The fact that the matting is impregnated with the product is established by the evidence of Dr Fredericks. Furthermore, it is a matter asserted in the material that the first respondent had on its website in 2004. 15 The trial judge analysed the patent at [104]---[106], discussed some evidence in relation to it and went on to hold as follows ( Termite Tite (NZ) No 2 Ltd 74 IPR 16 ; [2007] FCA 1493 at [132] ):
 "I do not think any of the prior patents or patent applications are novelty-defeating. As far as the Kennedy and Hitchen patent is concerned there are clear differences between that patent and the invention embodied in claims 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 9 of the Patent. They are: 
 
 1. The trial judge analysed the patent at [107]---[110]. His Honour referred to the evidence of Mr Langley and Mr Angliss (both of whom he accepted as witnesses) to the effect that it disclosed a barrier applied across the whole of the foundation, under the floor of the building rather than "perimeter defence" claimed in the patent in suit ([118], [123]). The trial judge went on to hold ( Termite Tite (NZ) No 2 Ltd 74 IPR 16 ; [2007] FCA 1493 at [133] ):
 "A similar conclusion should be reached in relation to the Ogawa patent. The invention in that patent is used in quite a different way from the invention in the Patent. The Ogawa patent was for under-slab protection whereas the Patent is clearly directed towards a barrier system that incorporates the concrete slab as part of the barrier.</sentence>
