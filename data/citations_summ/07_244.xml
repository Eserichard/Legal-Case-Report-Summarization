<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 695">In light of the High Court's decision in Campbells Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif [2006] HCA 41 ; (2006) 229 CLR 386 , IMF's proper role in these proceedings will be limited: see esp, per Callinan and Heydon JJ, at 493. The concerns discussed by French J (as his Honour then was) in QPXS Ltd v Ericsson Australia (No 5) [2007] FCA 244 , at [20] then have to be met. Unlike the applicant's solicitors, IMF is involved in these proceedings on a purely commercial basis: it is, relevantly, in the business of funding and profiting from litigation. It is not constrained by the professional or ethical restraints which bind the parties' legal representatives. It is, therefore, without imputing to IMF any tendency to impropriety, right for the respondents to be concerned, as French J said, about "the generic risk associated with the wider disclosure of the discovered documents... [They are] is entitled to seek specificity as to the documents to be disclosed and the purpose for which they are to be disclosed". To require an express undertaking from the relevant officers and agents of IMF is, therefore, not unusual and, in the light of Hearne v Street (supra) is not unreasonable. Conclusion

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 398">14 If, contrary to the views earlier expressed, the question is properly framed as whether Visy should be released from its implied undertaking, I have no hesitation in concluding that it should be: QPSX Limited v Ericsson Australia Ltd (No 5) [2007] FCA 244 at [13] --- [17]. Neither the ACCC nor Visy submitted that QPSX did not accurately summarise the applicable authorities and principles. And although the ACCC couched its submission in terms requiring demonstration of "special circumstances ... such as would justify releasing a party from the implied undertaking, in relation to a specified document for a specified purpose" , the ACCC did not submit that the discretion to be exercised was one in which it is possible or desirable to propound an exhaustive list of the factors that may bear upon the discretion: QPSX at [17]; Springfield Nominees Pty Limited v Bridgelands Securities Limited (1992) 38 FCR 217 at 225; Holpitt Pty Ltd v Varimu Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 269 ; (1991) 29 FCR 576 at 578.</sentence>
