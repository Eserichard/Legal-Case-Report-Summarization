<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 695">97 Considerable emphasis has been placed by the Court on general deterrence for contraventions of provisions of the TPA in previous matters involving consumer protection. These are equally applicable in respect of the consumer provisions of the CCA. As Justice Tracey stated in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skippy Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1343 at [15] :
 
 
 It has become accepted that the imposition of substantial penalties for breaches of provisions which are designed to protect consumers, will serve to alert members of the business community to the provisions of the Act and the serious consequences which may flow from their contravention. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 372">As Tracey J said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skippy Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1343 at [21] : 
 
 
 The warnings were intended to lessen the risk of harm befalling vulnerable young children. The failure to provide the cautionary notices meant that parents and carers were deprived of essential warnings and advice. 
 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 17">The point has been made on many occasions: Dimmeys Stores at 43,247 per Weinberg J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Prosecutor v MNB Variety Imports Pty Ltd [1998] ATPR 41-617 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skippy Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1343 at [15] . In the context of general deterrence, I take into account the fact that the risk of fire and burning is a very dangerous one and that the goods which were the subject of the Standard were goods to be used by infants. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1103">29 I note that in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chubb Security Australia Proprietary Limited [2004] FCA 1750 , 30 December 2004, under the heading "Parity", Bennett J, with respect, helpfully, surveyed a number of authorities which dealt with the question of penalty in the context of that case. There was some submission made to me that a like exercise might be undertaken in this case by reference to the circumstances of and the sentences imposed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skippy Australia Proprietary Limited [2006] FCA 1343 , and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allans Music Group Proprietary Limited [2002] FCA 1552. </sentence>
