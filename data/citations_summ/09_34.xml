<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 519">The applicant moves on a notice of motion seeking an order that the taxation of the first, second and third respondents' costs of a hearing that took place before Graham J be stayed. His Honour had delivered judgment on 30 January 2009 ( Canberra Residential Developments Pty Limited v Brendas (No 5) [2009] FCA 34). The stay is sought pending the final orders of the Full Court in the hearing of the appeal from Graham J's judgment. That hearing took place last week and judgment has been reserved. (The present motion does not concern the fourth respondent who has not filed a bill of costs and in these reasons, a reference to the respondents should be read as referring to the first, second and third respondents only. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 169">On 30 January 2009 Graham J ordered Canberra Residential Developments Pty Limited (CRD) to pay the respondents' costs incurred in connection with an unsuccessful application made by CRD; Canberra Residential Developments Pty Limited v Brendas (No5) [2009] FCA 34 ; 69 ACSR 435. On 16 February 2010 following a hearing on the applicant's notice of motion, I set aside an interim certificate of taxation issued on 8 February 2010 in respect of a bill of costs submitted by the first, second and third respondents; Canberra Residential Developments Pty Limited v Brendas [2010] FCA 90. I also ordered that no further certificate pursuant to the taxing officer's decision be issued for 14 days from the date of the order. </sentence>

CRD filed a notice of appeal on 20 February 2009. It is likely that the appeal will be heard over a number of days in the week commencing 11 May 2010. In the interim the first, second and third respondents have moved to recover their costs in accordance with the order made by Graham J. The fourth respondent has not yet filed a bill of costs and, in these reasons, unless otherwise indicated, a reference to the respondents should be read as referring to the first, second and third respondents and not to the fourth respondent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1484">By an amended notice of motion filed on 3 August 2009, the third respondent (applicant on the amended notice of motion) in the appeal seeks orders restraining two firms of solicitors from acting for the appellant, Canberra Residential Developments, in the forthcoming appeal from a judgment of Graham J delivered on 30 January 2009; [2009] FCA 34 ; (2009) 69 ACSR 435. His Honour dismissed claims made by Canberra Residential Developments Pty Ltd (CRD) against four respondents, including the present three respondents. The firms that are the subject of the present notice of motion are Ben Aulich and Associates ("BA") who presently represent the appellant and Meyer Vandenberg ("MV") a firm which has never represented the appellant but which has close ties with Ben Aulich and Associates. The notice of motion was supported by the affidavit of John Patrick Harris of JS O'Connor Harris &amp; Co which has the carriage of the appeal for the third respondent, Canberra Land Developments Pty Ltd (CLD). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 745">This is an application for security for costs in proceedings in the appellate jurisdiction of the Court. The appeal is brought from the decision of a judge of the Court: Canberra Residential Developments Pty Ltd v Brendas (No 5) [2009] FCA 34 ; (2009) 69 ACSR 435. It is common ground that the appellant should give security for costs and the only substantive issue before me is the amount of security that should be given. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 110">The dispute between the applicant and the respondents concerning the Gungahlin land was ventilated before Graham J in this Court over a number of days in 2008. On 30 January 2009, his Honour dismissed the application. The applicant was seeking an account of profits earned by the first respondent and others as well as declarations in relation to the land. The dispute arose out of a joint venture in which the applicant was the trustee of land for the joint venturers. It is not necessary for me to detail the facts which are amply canvassed in the judgment of Graham J; Canberra Residential Developments Pty Limited v Brendas (No5) [2009] FCA 34. </sentence>
