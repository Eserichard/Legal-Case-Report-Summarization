His Honour referred to SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1406 ; (2008) 172 FCR 452 , where Buchanan J concluded that s 424B(2) does not establish an obligation on the Tribunal which could lead either to statutory breach or to jurisdictional error.

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 794">It is also submitted that the decision of Buchanan J in SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [39] at [51] and [52] applies. In that case, Buchanan J held that a failure to comply with the strict terms of s.424B(2) did not, in the circumstances of that case, amount to jurisdictional error (see also SZIAR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [40] per Cameron FM at [33]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 807">Even if it were, I am satisfied that there would be no jurisdictional error, as I am satisfied that failing to specify the prescribed time for provide that information is not a jurisdictional error. In SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [42] , Buchanan J held at [52]: Section 424B(2) on its face directs that 'information or comments are to be given within a period specified in the invitation'. It does not, in terms, impose a direct obligation on the RRT about the terms of the invitation (cf s.424B(1) --- 'the invitation is to specify...' ). The consequence of any failure to specify a period is that the facility in s.424C of proceeding to a decision in the absence of the information might not be available but I do not see s.424B(2) as establishing the kind of obligation on the RRT which could lead to either statutory breach or jurisdictional error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 895">Although, in SZNPH at [40] and [41] I was not of the view that the evidence before me was sufficient for me to make that finding and note in the currently under review I am satisfied that the notice of constitution is sufficient for me to make that finding. The other matter that is relevant is that it was found in SZNAV , which, with respect, I am not following, just as, with respect, I am following the decision of Smith FM in SZNJT , which I believe to be correctly decided, but the jurisdictional error identified by Raphael FM in SZNAV was a breach of sub-section of 424B(2) of the Act. In my view and with the very greatest of respect, the decision of Buchanan J in SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [23] , is authority and binding authority for the proposition that not specifying a period in an invitation under s.424 , does not constitute a breach of sub-section 424B(2). In SZLWQ , which, with respect, I am unable to distinguish in the matter before me and as I said, is binding upon this court, Buchanan J said at [52]: [52] Section 424B(2) on its face directs that 'information or comments are to be given within a period specified in the invitation' . It does not, in terms, impose a direct obligation on the RRT about the terms of the invitation (cf.</sentence>

At [37] Tracey J acknowledged the conclusion reached by Jacobsen J in SZEXZ . The matter was considered again by Buchanan J in SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1406. At [52] his Honour said: "[52] Section 424B(2) on its face directs that 'information or comments are to be given within a period specified in the invitation'. It does not, in terms, impose a direct obligation on the RRT about the terms of the invitation (cf. s 424B(1) --- 'the invitation is to specify ...'). For these reasons I am not persuaded that a legislative intention can be discerned that a misstatement of the prescribed period in the letter of invitation should lead to invalidity of the Tribunal's ultimate decision at least in circumstances where, as here, the time stated was more generous than that prescribed, the applicant did not respond within the time stated, the applicant subsequently provided information sought and that information was taken into account by the Tribunal when it made its decision. " 

At [37] Tracey J acknowledged the conclusion reached by Jacobsen J in SZEXZ . The matter was considered again by Buchanan J in SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1406. At [52] his Honour said: "[52] Section 424B(2) on its face directs that 'information or comments are to be given within a period specified in the invitation'. It does not, in terms, impose a direct obligation on the RRT about the terms of the invitation (cf.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 569">Reference was made to SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 1406 ; (2008) 172 FCR 452 , in which Buchanan J considered the consequences of a failure to comply with requirements of s.424B(2) in relation to an invitation to give additional information. Relevantly, s.424B(2) directs that where there is an invitation under s.424(2) the information is to be given " within a period specified in the invitation . " His Honour stated at [52] that: The consequence of any failure to specify a period is that the facility in s 424C of proceeding to a decision in the absence of the information might not be available but I do not see s 424B(2) as establishing the kind of obligation on the RRT which could lead to either statutory breach or jurisdictional error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 343">However, there is a suggestion in a later decision of Buchanan J that the requirements of specification in 424B encompass concepts of sufficient compliance rather than literal or precise compliance (see SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1406 ; (2008) 172 FCR 452 at [50] - [52]). If so, the present email may suffice in its compliance with the formal requirements. It might appear implicit that a request to provide a " student visa file " expected that " the way in which the additional information " was to be provided would be by providing the file or a copy of those documents. Less clearly, it might also be thought that a request to a government department that this be done "as soon as possible" is sufficient to indicate " a reasonable period " for asking for those documents in the present circumstances. Applying this flexible approach to the formal requirements arising under s.424B(1) and (2), I would not be satisfied that there was a departure from their requirements. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 103">
 Second, again assuming (without concession) that sections 424(2), 424(3) and 424B were attracted, the first respondent notes that, whereas DFAT were given 20 days to answer the request, regulation 4.35 prescribes, from the date the request is received, 28 days if the information is to be provided from overseas. This is not a jurisdictional error. The judgment of Buchanan J in SZLWQ v MIAC [2008] FCA 1406 assists. That judgment concerned a case where a facsimile communication with a foreign organisation specified no time for response at all. Buchanan J held that there was no "breach" of the Act or jurisdictional error - section 424C not having been (purportedly) relied upon by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 6">No confidence could have been placed by the Tribunal on the information obtained in such circumstances and the Tribunal offered no real reason for finding that such reliance was justified [CB 265]. The failure of the Tribunal to comply with s424(2) and (3) was a jurisdictional error. This is not merely a case in which the Applicant seeks to complain about the form of the notice cf SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [9] , SZIAR v Minister for Immigration [10] . As in SZKTI , there was no written invitation at all to the person from whom the information was actually requested, namely Ms Topuria. The fact that the information was subsequently put to the Applicant for comment in compliance with s424A could not cure the jurisdictional error --- a s424A invitation had also been sent in SZKTI [11] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 29">In this case, as Mr Knackstredt pointed out, the information was referred to in the Tribunal's s. 424A letter to the applicant of 8 th July 2008 [25] and was discussed with the applicant during the Tribunal hearing [26] . I am satisfied that the applicant was given ample opportunity to deal with the Tribunal's concerns about this issue and there is no procedural unfairness to the applicant. In any event, counsel for the Minister has drawn the Court's attention to the decision of Buchanan J in SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [27] which appears to be directly on point. His Honour said at [52]: Section 424B(2) on its face directs that 'information or comments are to be given within a period specified in the invitation'. It does not, in terms, impose a direct obligation on the RRT about the terms of the invitation (cf.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 1715">On that basis, if the further emails the Tribunal sent to the Liaison Unit that were forwarded to the Consulate General after the first enquiry and response could be said to be within s.424(2) as an invitation to give additional information, the Tribunal gave such further invitation by one of the methods specified in s.441A sent to the email address used in the initial response. Sub-section (5) provides for transmission by email to the last email address provided to the Tribunal by the recipient in connection with the review. Consistent with the approach taken by Buchanan J in SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1406 at [51] , while s.424B(1) directs the Tribunal to specify the way in which additional information is to be provided, the recipients in these circumstances clearly understood that they were being invited to reply " in kind " by email, given the prior course of dealings between them. On this basis there would be no breach of s.441A or s.424B(1) in relation to such further information.  In so far as the applicant may be seen as contending that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by disclosing identifying information to the PSB I note the rejection of the suggestion that compliance with the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) was a prerequisite to the making of a valid decision by the Tribunal in SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1406 at [32] (and see Goldie v Commonwealth of Australia [2000] FCA 1873 ; (2000) 180 ALR 609 per French J at [85] --- [87] and Abbasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1274 per Beaumont J at [67]). This ground is not made out. Section 424A and information obtained as a result of Tribunal inquiries
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 1692">However, in a subsequent decision Buchanan J, who it should be noted gave the leading judgment in SZKCQ in which not only was SZKTI upheld but the matters the subject of that decision were revisited and found to have been correctly decided, gave a further decision in SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1406 ("SZLWQ"). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 1495">As Buchanan J held in SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1406: Section 424B(1) directs the RRT to specify the way in which the additional information is to be given. Clearly it was not to be at an interview. Equally clearly, Mr Kalin understood that he was being invited to respond in kind, by facsimile. The course of dealings between him and the senior researcher since the first enquiry by facsimile on 12 April 2002 had established that as their mutual, and agreed, method of communication. In my view the nomination of a facsimile number as a facility for the response was also a sufficient specification of a method of response. Accordingly, there was no breach of s.424B(1). (at [51]) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FMCA 1348">None of the Tribunal's emails ostensibly met the requirements of ss.424B(1) or (2), even though it can be assumed that Mr Deller was being invited to respond by email. In not dissimilar circumstances, Buchanan J held in SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1406 that no jurisdictional error was disclosed. As his Honour said: Section 424B(1) directs the RRT to specify the way in which the additional information is to be given. Clearly it was not to be at an interview.</sentence>
