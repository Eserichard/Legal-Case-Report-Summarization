<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 1007">How much of that surrounding context must also be disclosed must necessarily depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case. In some cases it may be necessary to identify the "source" from which information has been obtained. Thus, in SZLIQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1405 Buchanan J concluded that extracts from a published book and the source of that material should have been disclosed. Indeed, the extent of disclosure may not necessarily be confined to the disclosure of material which ensures that a particular part is not rendered misleading; the touchstone is that ss 424A and 424AA require the disclosure of so much as to ensure that the opportunity to "comment ... or respond ..." is meaningful. In some cases the disclosure of the "substance" of information may be sufficient ( NAVM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [ 2004] FCA 99 at [33] ); in other cases "clear particulars" may require more.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 108">111 In SZLIQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1405 ( "SZLIQ" ) I decided that the undisclosed use by the RRT of an Australian book about growing vegetables in home gardens to evaluate commercial potato growing practices in China led it into jurisdictional error. However, that judgment is distinguishable from the present case. In SZLIQ the use by the RRT of an Australian home gardening book bore no apparent relevance to an understanding of commercial potato growing practices in China, or to an assessment of that appellant's knowledge about such practices. In the present case the text used by the RRT as the basis of its questions, although unidentified, was understood by the first respondent to reflect the teachings of Falun Gong. His answers were given with an evident appreciation that his knowledge of Falun Gong teachings and practices was being compared with what the text disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 4"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 297">There may be circumstances in which the requirement to " give " information to which s 424A applies may not extend to a requirement to disclose the entirety of any document in which such " information " is contained. In those cases it may not matter for the purposes of making a decision affirming a refusal of a protection visa that the " information " in question is but part of a document or report touching other matters or containing diverse other matters. In those cases the disclosure of that specific part of a much lengthier document may be sufficient. But " information " for the purposes of s 424A cannot in all cases be clinically divorced from the context it which it appears. How much of that surrounding context must also be disclosed must necessarily depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case. In some cases it may be necessary to identify the " source " from which information has been obtained. Thus, in SZLIQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1405 Buchanan J concluded that extracts from a published book and the source of that material should have been disclosed.
