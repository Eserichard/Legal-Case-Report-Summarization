<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 654">There is no matter in dispute in the proceeding as to the role or liability of Arc en Ciel Voyages in relation to the conduct of Mr Pantaloni giving rise to the contract and ultimately the claim against him. It cannot be said therefore that Arc en Ciel Voyages is an entity the joinder of which as a party is necessary in order to ensure that all matters in controversy are dispositively dealt with. In Comcare v John Holland Rail [2009] FCA 660 ; (2009) 109 ALD 508 at 514; [2009] FCA 660 at [13] , Jessup J considered the authorities relating to the expression "all matters in dispute in the proceeding" and discussed the observations of Branson J in Warner Music Australia v Swiftel Communications [2005] FCA 1127 ; (2005) 67 IPR 27 at 29 and 30; [2005] FCA 1127 at [13] . After discussing the authorities, Jessup J in Comcare said this: 
 
 I also agree that it will not be sufficient for an applicant seeking joinder merely to show that he or she has claims against the proposed respondent which could not be dismissed as unarguable in the [ General Steel Industries Inc. v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125] sense. However, with respect to Branson J, neither do I accept that O 6 r 8 is concerned only with existing proceedings which are "improperly constituted by reason of the failure to join a person as a party".</sentence>
