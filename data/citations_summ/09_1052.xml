<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1062">On 18 September 2009, I made orders in this proceeding, dismissing an application for leave to serve the originating process on the respondent outside Australia. I also ordered that there be no order as to the applicant's costs of that application and reserved liberty to the applicant to apply in the proceeding. On that occasion, I published reasons for judgment. See West v TWG Services Limited [2009] FCA 1052. In the course of those reasons for judgment, I expressed the conclusion that, with respect to most of the causes of action on which the applicant then relied, he had failed to satisfy the requirement of O 8 r 3(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules (Cth) ("the Federal Court Rules ") that he have a prima facie case for the relief he claimed in the proceeding. My conclusion was that, with respect to most of the seven causes of action then relied on, there was not a prima facie case. As an order granting leave to serve originating process outside Australia was a discretionary matter, I took the view that I ought not exercise my discretion in favour of the applicant, when he was unable to make out a prima facie case with respect to the preponderance of his claims. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 704">The Commission relies on West v TWG Services Limited (2009) 189 IR 97 ; [2009] FCA 1052 , in which Gray J considered the operation of the O 8 following its amendment in 2006. In West , the application sought different relief on the basis of alleged breaches of contract and two different statutes. Justice Gray found there was only a prima facie case in respect of the statutory claims under one statute but not as to the relief sought on the basis of the other statute or the contract alleged to have been breached. His Honour commented that ' technically the proceeding as a whole might fall within O 8 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules ' but declined to order service as a matter of discretion due the small number of claims justifying the grant of leave for service. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1429">Notwithstanding compliance with O 8 r 3(2) the Court retains a discretion as to whether leave should be granted to serve a respondent outside Australia. So much follows from the use of the term " may ". It has thus been observed that "... the power given by O 8 r 3(2) is clearly a discretionary power ": West v TWG Services Ltd [2009] FCA 1052 at [10] . His Honour Justice Gray was there satisfied that the requirements of O 8 r 3(2) had been satisfied but nevertheless concluded as follows: 
 
 [61] This being the case, my view is that I should refuse the leave sought to serve the amended application and the amended statement of claim on the respondent in England. To serve those documents in their present form would be to visit upon the respondent a proceeding in Australia involving a significant number of claims, with only a small number of those claims justifying the grant of leave for such service.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1206">The approach to be taken was discussed by Gray J in West v TWG Services Ltd [2009] FCA 1052. In that case, His Honour examined Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd [2003] FCAFC 153. At [9] , His Honour said: 
 
 "The court [in Bray ] was divided on the issue whether this requirement should be construed as a requirement that the applicant have a prima facie case in respect of every cause of action in the proceeding, or only a prima facie case in respect of the relief sought in the application, even if that relief were sought by reference to alternative causes of action which did not bring the proceeding within one of the kinds referred to in the then O 8 r 1.</sentence>
