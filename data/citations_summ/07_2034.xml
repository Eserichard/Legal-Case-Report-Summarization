<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1004">Pleadings' issues may fall into the category of substantive rights. In Bond v Barry [2007] FCA 2034 ; (2007) 74 IPR 504 , Gilmour J dealt with an application for leave to appeal from a decision of French J to strike out a statement of claim stating: 
 
 27 The judgment, whilst interlocutory, is one on points of substance and not merely practice or procedure. A distinction is drawn between these: Yap v Granich &amp; Associates [2001] FCA 1735 at [6] ; Dunstan v Orr [2007] FCA 873 at [6] ; see also Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2007) 161 FCR 122 [2007] FCAFC 147 at [39] per Lander J with Moore J concurring. In a case where judgment has the practical effect of finally determining a party's rights, a prima facie case exists for granting leave to appeal: Duncan v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2007] FCA 507 at [18] . 
 

 
 
 28 In this case, the practical effect of the decision prevents the first and second applicants from ever pursuing a claim for damages for breach of s 52 of the Act (and equivalent provisions in the Fair Trading Acts) arising out of the conduct referred to in the applicants' statement of claim. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 115">56 As Gilmour J observed at [32] of his reasons on the leave application ( Bond v Barry [2007] FCA 2034) , the issue which arose in Seven Network raised a different question from the one which was dealt with by French J. This is because his Honour considered that the publication of Mr Barry's email was not a publication of a matter "in connection with" the supply of services the subject of the contract between the journalist and the media organisation.</sentence>
