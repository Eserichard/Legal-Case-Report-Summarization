<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 1000">In Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1707 (" Aristocrat Technologies "), Jacobson J observed that consistently with the usual practice which had evolved in relation to search orders, although provision were made for protection of privileged or confidential material, an applicant could typically examine the seized materials without a prior determination of relevance. While it could be a matter of concern where the seized materials were obtained from a trade competitor, the applicant must satisfy stringent conditions laid down in O 25B r 3, and, in the case at hand, the search was not limited to the precise cause of action known to the applicants at the date of the order. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1201">39 No submission was advanced on behalf of the Applicants contrary to the importance attached by the common law to protecting the privacy of individuals. Their submission was that the primacy attached to the administration of justice extended to conferring authority to access the materials as an adjunct to the discovery process. This contention was said by the Applicants to have been resolved by Jacobson J in Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1707. An order pursuant to O 25B in that proceeding had previously been made by Allsop J (as he then was). Consent orders were made on 7 September 2006 which provided for inspection by the Applicants and their solicitors. 28 In that context, it is considered that the discretion to allow an applicant to inspect seized documents may be exercised to permit:
 
(a) an assessment to be made as to whether or not there has been compliance with the order as made and (possibly) whether any further order pursuant to O 25B may be warranted; 
 
(b) the identification and separation from the entirety of those documents that were in fact seized, those documents which do or may provide evidence pending the hearing and determination of a proceeding; and
 
(c) the identification and separation from the entirety of those documents that were in fact seized, those documents which do not provide such evidence so that those documents may be returned. And, in identifying those documents which should be preserved pending the final hearing and determination of a proceeding:
 
(d) the search is not limited to those documents directly related to the precise cause of action then known: cf Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 862 at [6] ---[7] per Allsop J; Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1707 at [4] per Jacobson J. There may well be other reasons for granting leave to an applicant to inspect seized documents. All of the purposes identified, however, have one thing in common -- they allow the documents which have been seized to be inspected in order to ensure that the search order has been complied with and to ensure that only evidence which should be preserved is in fact preserved pending the final determination of a proceeding. </sentence>
