<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 476">I have added emphasis to the passage cited from Cox v Journeaux (No 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713. See also Fitzpatrick v Keelty [2008] FCA 35 per Moore J (at [39]-[50). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1050">The present, as I have noted, is not a s 60 case, and neither is Mr Rana an undischarged bankrupt. Nonetheless I consider I am obliged to follow the reasoning of the Daemar cases insofar as it has a direct bearing upon the matter before me: cf Farar Constructions . Whatever my own concerns, they are decisions of long standing which have been considered and applied without demur including in decisions of this Court: see eg Madden v Madden [1995] FCA 297 ; Fitzpatrick v Keelty [2008] FCA 35. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1939">25 They contended that the exceptions in s 116(2), and in particular s 116(2)(g), do not apply. That exception, it is contended, only applies where damages are to be assessed by reference to "the pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his mind, body or character and without reference to his rights of property": Fitzpatrick v Keelty [2008] FCA 35 at [39] - [47] and Daemar v Industrial Commission (NSW) (1988) 12 NSWLR 45. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1554">26 In my view, s 60(4) is not intended to preserve to a bankrupt a claim to set aside a bankruptcy notice, as it is intended to preserve only the prosecution and benefits of litigation if there are potential benefits to the bankrupt which are not legitimately entitlements of the bankrupt's creditors: see eg Daemar v Industrial Commission of New South Wales (1988) 12 NSWLR 45 esp per Kirby P at 55-56, and per Samuels JA at 57. See also Hamilton v Young [2007] QSC 160 ; Fitzpatrick v Keelty [2008] FCA 35 per Moore J at [44]-[53]. The application to set aside the bankruptcy notice will not directly result in any award of damages to the appellant. If he has any such claims, preserved by s 60(4), they can still be pursued provided they have been brought within time. The refusal to set aside the bankruptcy notice does not affect the extent of the claims the appellant may still pursue under s 60(4). Moreover, the judgment referred to in [8] above, which was the subject of an unsuccessful collateral attack in the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice, was itself only indirectly a route to potential personal benefits to the appellant; it challenged the lawfulness of decisions about the record of reasons for the appellant ceasing to be a member of the Australian Army. As I have noted, putting aside the ultimately unsuccessful High Court proceeding, the set offs, counterclaims or cross demands he asserted relying on s 40(1)(g) of the Act provided the other reason of the appellant to set aside the bankruptcy notice. If the appellant has such claims, and they fall within s 60(4), he will be able to pursue them independently of his application to set aside the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 742">7 In Fitzpatrick v Keelty [2008] FCA 35 , I held that the causes of action that arose from or were incidental to the termination of the applicant's employment did not fall within the exception in s 60(4) and accordingly were deemed to have been abandoned under s 60(3) of the Bankruptcy Act . In relation to those causes of action that did not arise from or were incidental to the termination of the applicant's employment, I considered that they did not have reasonable prospects of success, and accordingly, I struck them out on that basis (see Fitzpatrick v Keelty [2008] FCA 35 at [52] --- [57]).
  2 On 31 January 2008 (see Fitzpatrick v Keelty [2008] FCA 35) I made the following orders in both proceedings:
 
 
 1 To the extent that the proceedings are not stayed by operation of s 60 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), the proceedings be dismissed. 
 2 Costs be reserved.  3 The parties file and serve any submission on costs by 4 pm on 14 February 2008. 
 

When the matter was next before me for directions on 7 March 2008, counsel for the respondents submitted, and I agreed, that order (1) above should read "to the extent that the proceedings have not been abandoned under s 60 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), the proceedings be dismissed". This amendment to order (1) does not impact upon the issue of what is the appropriate costs order in the proceedings. 3 It is unnecessary for me to set out in detail the history of the litigation (see Fitzpatrick v Keelty [2008] FCA 35 at [4] --- [36]), save as to the following. 
  7 In Fitzpatrick v Keelty [2008] FCA 35 , I held that the causes of action that arose from or were incidental to the termination of the applicant's employment did not fall within the exception in s 60(4) and accordingly were deemed to have been abandoned under s 60(3) of the Bankruptcy Act . In relation to those causes of action that did not arise from or were incidental to the termination of the applicant's employment, I considered that they did not have reasonable prospects of success, and accordingly, I struck them out on that basis (see Fitzpatrick v Keelty [2008] FCA 35 at [52] --- [57]).
