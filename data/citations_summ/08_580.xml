<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 760">1 I have before me an application this morning for the termination of an order for the winding up of the first defendant, Arizcorp Pty Ltd, pursuant to orders that were made on 29 February 2008. The matter was last before the Court on 24 April 2008 and adjourned on terms to this morning. The history of the matter is recited in ex tempore reasons I delivered on 24 April 2008 and I do not propose to go into the reasons at great length except that it might be convenient to simply quote what I said on that occasion ( Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Arizcorp Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2008] FCA 580). At para [3] , I said this:
 The history of the matter involves a statutory demand made by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (which I will refer to as the ATO) in relation to taxation liabilities due to the Commonwealth by the first defendant company. Taxation returns under the PAYE regime have not been lodged in 1999 and 2000 and after the introduction of the BAS protocols taxation returns were not lodged throughout a number of years. The end result of the ultimate lodgement of returns and assessment of the unpaid tax was that an amount of $631,955.71, among perhaps some other moneys, became payable to the commissioner. The company has fully paid that amount of money.  1 I have before me an application this morning for the termination of an order for the winding up of the first defendant, Arizcorp Pty Ltd, pursuant to orders that were made on 29 February 2008.
