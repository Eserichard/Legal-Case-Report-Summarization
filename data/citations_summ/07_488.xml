<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 18">However, the clarity and detail of information provided pursuant to s.359A(1)(a) may be sufficient to lead to the situation where the Tribunal has complied with s.359A(1)(b), without giving the explanation which that paragraph contemplates. Even if the Tribunal fails to take independent steps under s.359A(1)(b) to ensure that an applicant understands why particularised information is relevant to the review, that relevance may be self-evident from the information itself: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v SZGMF at [41]; Wang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 488 at [29] . As Flick J said in SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (No.2) [2009] FCA 486 ; (2009) 109 ALD 242 in relation to the RRT's equivalent of s.359A(1): Although s 424A(1) imposes the trinity of requirements set forth in paras (a), (b) and (c), it is not considered that compliance with s 424A(1) is necessarily to be approached by considering each of the three requirements as though it were divorced from the rest. The greater the degree of clarity in the "particulars of any information" provided, the less may be the exposition needed to convey the relevance of that information to the review being undertaken; the greater the uncertainty in the information being provided, the greater may be the need to explain why it may be relevant. Section 424A(1)(b) remains a requirement to be satisfied; but the steps to be undertaken to discharge that requirement may well depend upon the clarity with which the information has been identified and indeed the character of that information. (at 254 [52]) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 813">What is abundantly clear is that even if the matter were to be returned to the Tribunal, in circumstances where the Tribunal had affirmed the delegate's decision in relation to the Association, and I could find no jurisdictional error in that decision ( North Shore Sikh Association Incorporated ), then in relation to Mr Singh's visa application the Tribunal would be bound to affirm the delegate's decision in relation to him, even after attending to its s.359A obligation. (See Barkat v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 510 , Hao Jiang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 907 and Wang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 488. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 1943">(4) The Tribunal made jurisdictional error by failing to properly advice [sic] the applicant as to why the letter issued pursuant to section 359A of the Act (at Cb 60-61) clear particulars of information that would be relevant for review (section 359A(1)(a) and (b)) and providing particulars as to why it is relevant for review. Particulars The Tribunal asserted a conclusion that the visa lodged on 27 March 2006 was 'invalid' and certainly did not make any reference to the lack of COE which later formed the basis of affirming the decision of the delegate. The Tribunal was required to give proper section 359A notice: Wang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 488 [at 27-30]; Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Awan [2003] FCAFC 140. (5) The Tribunal made jurisdictional error by reviewing decision is that is not MRT reviewable decision pursuant to section 338 of the Migration Act such error of law constituting jurisdictional error. Particulars The Tribunal accepted that a valid visa application on 17 August 2006 (at CB 101.3) was lodged and found that the application was made more than 28 days after the applicant's last substantive visa ceased (at CB 101.4).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 1944">I am not persuaded by this argument. I have had regard to the fact that the undisputed evidence in relation to whether there was a s.417 request extant at the time of the bridging visa application is such that the applicant could not have satisfied those criteria that relate to such a request (subclauses 050.212(b), (6AA) and (6A)) if the matter were remitted to the Tribunal. (see Jankovic v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1994] FCA 1316 ; (1995) 56 FCR 474 ; Morales v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic affairs (1995) 60 FCR 550 Wang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 488 and Jiang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 907. However, a reconstituted Tribunal would consider afresh each of the criteria in clause 050.212. Other issues might have emerged in any such reconsideration, given that not all of the grounds in clause 050.212 turn on objective criteria or facts (see eg. subclauses 050.212(2) and 050.212(3)(b)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 690">In oral submissions, the applicant relied upon Wang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 488 at [28] to [29] where Besanko J said: 
 
 
 The Full Court considered the obligations in s 424A of the Act in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZGMF [2006] FCAFC 138.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 907">25 The circumstances in Wang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 488 are similar to those in this case. Ms Wang did not make satisfactory progress and failed a number of subjects. She was excluded by the relevant Faculty for unsatisfactory academic progress.</sentence>
