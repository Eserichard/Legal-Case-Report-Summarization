<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 148">I am satisfied, for these reasons, that all of the necessary approvals have been sought, and that it is appropriate to make orders under section 413(1)(d) of the Corporations Act . That subsection applies in connection with a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation. I do not think that the subject schemes are schemes of reconstruction: see Re South African Supply and Cold Storage (1904) 2 Ch 268 at 286; see also Psivida Limited v New Psivida Inc [2008] FCA 627 at [13] . However, it is clear that the schemes are in connection with an amalgamation of St George Bank and Westpac, and section 413(1) specifically provides that an order may be made by a later order after the approval of the scheme of arrangement. </sentence>
