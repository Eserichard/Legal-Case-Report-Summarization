<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1320">For present purposes, on an application for leave to amend the defence, the question is simply whether the contention that the exercise of the discretion under s 87 is to be informed by the factors discussed, is an arguable contention. I am satisfied that the matter is arguable and that leave ought to be given to plead the facts relevant to that matter. As to these matters generally see Woods v De Gabriele &amp; Ors [2007] VSC 177 per Hollingworth J; cf BHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2008] FCA 1656 per Finkelstein J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] TASFC 3">10 The impetus for the introduction of the proportionate liability legislation in question into Australia was explained as follows in BHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1656 by Finklestein J at pars[4] --- [5]: 
 
 
 "4 Proportionate liability was introduced into state and federal legislation following an inquiry into the law of joint and several liability established by the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Attorneys-General in 1994. The impetus for the inquiry was the growing number of actions against professionals, particularly auditors, who were being singled out as targets for negligence actions not because of their culpability (which might be small) but because they were insured and had the capacity to pay large damages awards. One consequence was a sharp rise in insurance premiums payable by professionals. " 
 

The object of the Act is to "effect civil liability reforms". The second reading speech at the time Pt9A was introduced makes reference to the implementation of national reforms. Blow J set out in his reasons at par12 some paragraphs from a judgment of Finkelstein J in BHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1656 where his Honour dealt with the background to that national implementation. There is nothing in those comments suggestive of any intent to extend the provisions of the Act to arbitrations. 98 Another factor which might be relevant is the terms of legislation which preceded the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 128">To the extent that para 38B refers to the facts pleaded in para 38A it fails as against the second applicant, for the same reasons that para 38A is flawed in its reference to the second applicant. Proposed para 38C(a) pleads that the claims made by the first and second applicants is an apportionable claim however paras 2, 4 and 7 of the Application seek damages pursuant to s 87 of the Act, para 8 seeks damages for breach of contract and para 9 seeks damages for breach of duty. None of these claims are apportionable claims under the Act: BHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1656. To the extent that para 38C(c) refers to the facts pleaded in para 38A it fails as against the second applicant, for the same reasons that para 38A is flawed in its reference to the second applicant. Proposed para 38C(e) pleads that the second applicant is a concurrent wrongdoer but given that that conduct alleged against the second applicant does not disclose a good cause of action the second applicant cannot, in law, be a concurrent wrongdoer so far as concerns the first applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1554">The applicant accepted that but for the provisions of Part VIA of the Act, his proceeding was out of time. He submits that that Part permits his otherwise out of time claim. Part VIA deals with Proportionate Liability for Misleading and Deceptive Conduct and was introduced into the Act in 2004. Its purpose was explained by Finkelstein J in BHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1656 at [4] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] NSWSC 1238">


 
16 As the plaintiffs have contended:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 i. Declarations may be sought and made as to the existence of an obligation to comply with a statutory requirement: Simmonds v Newport [1921] 1 KB 616. 
 
 ii. The modern viewpoint is that in the ordinary case there is almost unlimited jurisdiction which the court may in its discretion exercise: Hanson v Radcliffe UDC [1922] 2 Ch 490 at 507, Forster v Jododex (Australia) Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 434 ff, and Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 ; 21 ALR 505: see P W Young QC at [401]. iii. The jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief is available though there has been no contravention of rights or breach of obligations. It is sufficient if there be a legal controversy between the parties to the suit: BHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1656 (10 November 2008); see also Dixon &amp; Ors v Laurance (1990) QSC, unreported. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] TASSC 89">12 Similar provisions were introduced in every Australian jurisdiction. The background to the amendments was summarised by Finkelstein J in BHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1656 at pars 4 --- 5, as follows:
 
 
 " [4] Proportionate liability was introduced into state and federal legislation following an inquiry into the law of joint and several liability established by the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Attorneys-General in 1994.
