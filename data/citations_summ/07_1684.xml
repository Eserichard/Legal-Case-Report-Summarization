<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 691">In Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 ; (2007) 98 ALD 589 (at [42]), Rares J said: 
 
 Each warrant, on its face, was termed a 'warrant'. It was issued by a Finnish court for the arrest of Mr Tervonen who was stated to have been suspected on probable cause of having committed an offence. The Minister could reasonably form the opinion that each document was a warrant, issued by a Finnish Court, in force, for the arrest of Mr Tervonen in relation to an offence against the law of Finland that he was accused of having committed within the meaning of s 6(a)(i). While other persons may not have formed the same view, having regard to the significant differences between the laws of other countries and Australia, to which Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ referred to in Kainhofer 185 CLR at 540, I am of opinion that it was open to Senator Ellison to form the view that each of the warrants was one which met the description in s 6(a)(i).

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 167">18 The appellant submitted that decisions subsequent to Bhardwaj also support this analysis. In Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476 ; [2003] HCA 2 at [76] the High Court cited Bhardwaj saying that "(t)his Court has clearly held that an administrative decision which involves jurisdictional error is 'regarded, in law, as no decision at all'". This Court applied the same approach in Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) (2007) 98 ALD 589 ; [2007] FCA 1684 at [115] . While this decision was varied on appeal ( Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen (2008) 166 FCR 91 ; [2008] FCAFC 24) the Full Court did not express any doubt about the correctness of the principle on which the primary judge relied. Similarly, in Lansen v Minister for Environment and Heritage (2008) 174 FCR 14 ; [2008] FCAFC 189 Moore and Lander JJ at [164]-[168] said:

However, none of these cases raised the issue before this Court of the legal effect of a decision affected by error where, upon judicial review of the decision of the administrative body, Constitutional writ relief was refused. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 207">The Respondents then pointed to the now accepted position that there is no constitutional prohibition against the appointment of more than one Minister of State to administer a department: Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor (2001) 207 CLR 391 at 403, [17]; 415-416; [66], 460, [211]; 498, [320] and 519, [380]; Zoeller v Attorney-General (Cth) (1987) 16 FCR 153 at 165; Attorney-General (Cth) v Foster [1999] FCA 81 ; (1999) 84 FCR 582 at 594; Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs [No 2] [2007] FCA 1684 at [128] to [130]. That being so, it was submitted that the Minister was entitled to administer the Judiciary Act , which included the administration of s 672A of the Queensland Criminal Code, to the extent that it was rendered applicable by s 68 of the Judiciary Act to the pardon application made by the Applicant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCAFC 3">11 However, I agree with Flick J that the course upon which Mr Tervonen wished to embark with his latest application was barred to him, even on the view of his application most favourable to him. The arguments that he wished to advance (accepting that they were capable of being related to the requirements of s 16 of the Act, even though that is not how his application was focused) were put to Rares J in proceedings concerning the application of s 16 and rejected ( Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684). The matters which he sought to argue before Flick J invited a conclusion contrary to that reached by Rares J about the same legal issue. When an appeal by the Minister for Home Affairs against the judgment of Rares J was heard Mr Tervonen did not attempt to revive the arguments or advance them as a reason why the appeal should be rejected (see Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24 ; (2008) 166 FCR 91). The proceedings dismissed by Flick J were commenced after the appeal was filed. By persisting with those proceedings after the appeal was dealt with he sought, effectively, to go behind the judgment of the Full Court on the appeal that a notice given under s 16 of the Act was substantially valid. That notice was based, in part, upon an opinion by the responsible Minister that Mr Tervonen was an "extraditable person" within the meaning of s 6(a)(i) of the Act. Flick J concluded that to permit such a course would be contrary to the decision of the High Court in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 ('Anshun') . </sentence>

 '20. It appears that Tervonen put a similar argument to Rares J in the proceeding challenging the validity of the s 16 notice --- see Tervonen [2007] FCA 1684 ; 98 ALD 589 at [33] ---[44]. Rares J decided that it was open to the Minister to form the relevant opinion but did not consider the correctness or otherwise of that opinion, the proceeding before him being a challenge on administrative law grounds. 
 
 21. 4 On 6 June 2007 a magistrate determined pursuant to s 19 of the Act that Mr Tervonen was eligible for surrender for offences itemised in the amended notice issued on 30 April 2007. However, on 6 November 2007 Rares J decided that each of the first two notices was invalid ( Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 1684). As a result, on 20 December 2007 Gyles J ordered that the magistrate's order made on 6 June 2007 be quashed ( Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1133">He submits that only a public prosecutor can bring a prosecution, the police powers being limited to the investigation stage. These submissions are not evidence, but have clearly flagged an issue. ... [20] It appears that Tervonen put a similar argument to Rares J in the proceeding challenging the validity of the s 16 notice -- see Tervonen [2007] FCA 1684 ; 98 ALD 589 at [33] ---[44]. Rares J decided that it was open to the Minister to form the relevant opinion but did not consider the correctness or otherwise of that opinion, the proceeding before him being a challenge on administrative law grounds. [21] In my opinion, it is tolerably clear in the present case that only the first three warrants would normally be regarded as being "for the arrest of the person for the offence", the other warrants being connected with coercive investigation. 20 To now permit Mr Tervonen to pursue his present arguments would certainly not promote finality in litigation and would now permit him to raise an argument which either has been raised and resolved or an argument which should have been raised before the trial judge in Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 , 98 ALD 589 and on appeal, if necessary, by way of a notice of contention.  24 It is considered that the argument now sought to be advanced by Mr Tervonen was, at the very least, " so relevant to the subject matter " of the proceeding being pursued before the trial judge in Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 , 98 ALD 589 that it was " unreasonable " for him not to have relied upon it in that proceeding. Not only were the terms of s 6(a)(i) the very subject matter of consideration by His Honour, the terms of the Treaty were also the subject matter of consideration. His Honour thus summarised one of the arguments being advanced before him for resolution as follows:
 [4] Mr Tervonen has challenged the validity of each s 16 notice. He argued that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was invalid because: ... (3) Article 7(2) of the Treaty Between Australia and Finland Concerning Extradition done at Helsinki on 7 June 1984 as amended by Art 3 of the Protocol Between Australia and Finland Amending the Treaty Concerning Extradition done at Helsinki on 10 September 1985 contained in Sch 2 to the Extradition (Finland) Regulations 1988 (Cth) required Finland to accompany its request for his extradition with a statement of each offence for which extradition was sought together with a statement of the acts or omissions which were alleged against Mr Tervonen in respect of each offence. Mr Tervonen argued that because in August 2006 Senator Ellison personally did not have before him all of this material, as required by the treaty, he could not issue the notice. Whether or not the warrants were for " offences ", the meaning of s 6(a)(i) was an issue under consideration, as were the terms of the Treaty. A matter centrally relevant to the " opinion " of the Minister when giving a notice under s 16 is the " opinion " as to whether a person is an " extraditable person " within the meaning of s 6. Any argument that a person is not an " extraditable person ", because there is no warrant for his arrest for an " offence ", is an argument which should have been raised -- if it was to be raised at all -- when the Minister's decisions under s 16 were under scrutiny by this Court either at first instance or on appeal. It is an argument which should have been advanced as a reason why the Minister could not have lawfully reached the " opinion " required. 15 The Respondent Minister further contends, in the alternative, that the present argument has in any event been advanced by Mr Tervonen and also resolved against him by the decision at first instance in Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 , 98 ALD 589. In issue in that proceeding were the first two of the notices issued pursuant to s 16 of the 1988 Act. In the course of his reasoning His Honour there observed:
 Did the Finnish warrants satisfy the criteria in s 6(a)(i)? 5 The first two notices have been the subject of a proceeding before a judge of this Court at first instance: Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 , 98 ALD 589. And there was then an appeal from that decision: Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24 , 166 FCR 91. An application for special leave to appeal was filed with the Sydney Registry of the High Court of Australia on 19 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 872">4 The August 2006 and April 2007 notices have been the subject of other proceedings. At first instance both notices were declared to be invalid: Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 1684 , 98 ALD 589. On appeal, the order declaring invalid the April 2007 notice was varied and the notice was held not to be a valid notice only with respect to specified offences: Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24 , 101 ALD 12. An application for special leave to appeal from the decision of the Full Court has apparently been filed with the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 781">1 On 20 December 2007 I made orders pursuant to s 21(2)(b)(i) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) (the Act) on the application of Jan Tervonen quashing an order of the second respondent made on 6 June 2007 that Tervonen was eligible for surrender to the first respondent, the Republic of Finland, for certain offences, and the consequent issue of a warrant pursuant to s 19(9) of the Act ( Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067). That decision was based upon the judgment of Rares J in Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 1684 ; (2007) 98 ALD 589 and consequent orders declaring invalid and quashing successive notices purporting to have been given pursuant to s 16 of the Act ( Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 3) [2007] FCA 1898). That basis for the decision meant that I did not need to consider the other arguments raised on behalf of Tervonen. The Full Court allowed an appeal from the decision of Rares J ( Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24 , corrected in Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen (No 2) [2008] FCAFC 32). Consequently, on 6 March 2008, the Full Court allowed an appeal from my earlier decision, set aside the orders that I had made and remitted the matter to me to be determined according to law ( Republic of Finland v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 25).  20 It appears that Tervonen put a similar argument to Rares J in the proceeding challenging the validity of the s 16 notice --- see Tervonen [2007] FCA 1684 ; 98 ALD 589 at [33] ---[44]. Rares J decided that it was open to the Minister to form the relevant opinion but did not consider the correctness or otherwise of that opinion, the proceeding before him being a challenge on administrative law grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 596">4 The Applicant contends that there is no power to revoke the s 16 notice: Dutton v Republic of South Africa [1999] FCA 498 , 162 ALR 625 ; Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 at [108] , [2007] FCA 1684 ; 98 ALD 589 (Varied: Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 331">19 The approach urged upon the Court by Mr Karsten, namely an invitation to go behind the face of both the request and (more importantly) the warrant itself is an invitation which should be rejected. Section 16(2) , framed as it is in terms of an " opinion ", should not be construed as requiring the Attorney-General or the Minister to become an expert in foreign law and construed in a manner which has the potential to frustrate the discharge by Australia of its obligations under extradition treaties: Tervonen v Minister for Justice &amp; Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 , 98 ALD 589. Rares J there observed:
 
 [38] In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Kainhofer (1995) 185 CLR 528 at 540 Brennan CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ left open the meaning to be attributed to the word 'accused' in s 6(a)(i) of the Act, noting:
 It is sufficient to say that, in considering whether a person is an extraditable person under s 6(a)(i) of the Act, it is necessary to bear in mind the statutory object of enabling Australia to carry out its obligations under extradition treaties with countries that adopt a variety of criminal procedures different from our own. [39] The Attorney-General cannot be expected to be an expert in foreign law: Williams v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCAFC 33 ; 157 FCR 286 at 298 [49] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCAFC 24">1 The appellant raises 17 grounds of appeal against orders made by a judge of the Court on 8 November 2007 quashing two notices under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) in respect of an extradition request received from Finland in relation to Mr Jan Tervonen: Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FCAFC 25">2 The parties agreed that the outcome of this appeal turns solely upon whether the appeal from Rares J in Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 succeeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FCA 99">4 On 15 February 2008 the Full Court of the Federal Court heard an appeal from the decision of Gyles J and an appeal from a further decision concluding that notices issued under s 16 of the 1988 Act were invalid ( Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 , 98 ALD 589). On that date the Full Court extended the orders as previously made by Rares J for a period " up to and including the determination of the appeal from Gyles J . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2007] FCA 2107">5 Finland's appeal is set down for hearing on 15 February 2008, cognately with an appeal from a decision which I had given, namely that the two s 16 notices issued by the two previous Ministers were each invalid: Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2007] FCA 2067">2 On 6 November 2007 Rares J delivered reasons for judgment and stood the matter over for argument as to the appropriate relief to be granted ( Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 1684). On 8 November 2007 Rares J made declarations and orders, the effect of which was to declare invalid and quash successive notices purporting to have been given pursuant to s 16 ( Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 3) [2007] FCA 1898). Rares J declined to grant any further relief to the applicant including an order for release. </sentence>

I referred to this in my primary reasons: Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 at [214(c)] . Instead, Mr Tervonen now relies on the statement of the Full Court in Williams 157 FCR at 298 [53] which I have quoted above. He does not seek any further order against the Attorney-General or the Minister at this time except liberty to apply for any further or other relief that might be necessary to give effect to my judgment. </sentence>
