<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 45">Contrary to the respondent's submissions, in my view the relevant time is the time at which judgment was obtained by the creditor in the original proceedings (see ICM Agriculture Pty Ltd v Young (2009) 6 ABC(NS) 765; [2009] FCA 109 at [2] --- [4] and Westbrook v National Australia Bank Ltd ) that is, 7 May 2009. Even if the relevant time was the time at which judgment was entered, according to the sealed certificate of order that also occurred on 7 May 2009. It was not addressed in any detail on the procedure for the entry of orders made by the District Court of New South Wales (see for example Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Meredith (No 2) (2008) 75 NSWLR 462 ; [2008] NSWCA 133 in relation to r.36.11 of the UCPR). It has not been established that entry of the orders occurred after 7 May 2009 or that the subsequent variation to paragraph 6 of the orders made and entered on 7 May 2009 meant that the date of the order that formed the basis for the Bankruptcy Notice should be regarded as a later date. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 975">
 


 
14 The first question is whether the affidavit verifying the statement of claim is evidence on this application of the facts alleged in the statement of claim capable of giving rise to a serious question to be tried that the caveat has or may have substance. A similar question was considered by Lindgren J in the Federal Court in ICM Agriculture Pty Ltd v Young [2009] FCA 109. That was an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrate's Court ordering the setting aside of a bankruptcy notice on the ground that the Court was satisfied that the judgment debtor had a counter claim set off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the judgment debt that could not have been set up in the proceedings in which the judgment debt was given. On such an application the judgment debtor was required to " satisfy the Court " that there was a prima facie case of the counter claim, set off or cross demand, the establishment of which did not necessarily require the adducing of evidence which would be admissible on a final hearing ( Glew v Harrowell of Hunt &amp; Hunt Lawyers [2003] FCA 373 at [8] - [9] ). The approach is not materially different from the requirement under s 74K(2) that the Court be satisfied that the caveat or its claim has or may have substance. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1169">Following a hearing at which ICM and Mr Young were represented by counsel, I ordered on 19 February 2009 that the appeal be allowed, the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court be set aside, and in lieu thereof it be ordered that the application to that Court be dismissed. I also ordered that Mr Young pay ICM's costs of the FMC Bankruptcy Notice proceeding and that he pay ICM's costs of the FC Bankruptcy Notice Appeal: ICM Agriculture Pty Ltd v Young [2009] FCA 109 (Earlier Reasons for Judgment). I will take my Earlier Reasons for Judgment as read. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1065">On 19 February 2009 I allowed an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia which had set aside a bankruptcy notice issued on the application of ICM against the first applicant, Daryl William Young (Mr Young): see ICM Agriculture Pty Ltd v Young [2009] FCA 109. </sentence>
