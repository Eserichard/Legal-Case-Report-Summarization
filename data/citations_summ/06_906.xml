<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 796">The ill-considered pleadings situation described by Bennett J has also been singled out in other decisions. It has been described as arising where: "an applicant has attempted a number of versions of the statement of claim with the result that additional directions hearings were necessary, which should not have been; interlocutory applications had to be brought; and, moreover, substantial delays were incurred in the attempt to plead a case": All Services Australia Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd (2000) 171 ALR 330 ; [2000] FCA 375 at [11] per Kiefel J; and: "In lengthy and complex cases where substantial costs have been thrown away as a result of ill-considered pleadings being drawn": Airservices Australia Pty Ltd v Jeppesen Sanderson Inc [2006] FCA 906 per Graham J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 866">The decision in Baldry v Jackson has since been applied by this Court: Pollack v Retravision (NSW) Ltd (Unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Moore J, 23 December 1996); Airservices Australia v Jeppesen Sanderson Inc [2006] FCA 906 at [39] per Graham J. As explained by Burchett J in Vamuta Pty Ltd v Sogo Co Ltd (1996) 68 FCR 151 at 155: " As was held by the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in Baldry v Jackson ... a merely 'inchoate' claim cannot support an initiating process until it is 'consummate' ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 616">In Airservices Australia v Jeppesen Sanderson Inc [2006] FCA 906 Graham J held at [32]: 
 
 
 The making of an order under Order 62 rule 3 is justified where, through no fault of a party, such as the first and second respondents in the present case, there has been substantial delay in the proceedings because an applicant has attempted a number of versions of the Application and the Statement of Claim, additional directions hearings have taken place which should not have been necessary, interlocutory steps have been taken and applications have been brought unnecessarily given the changes to the pleadings that have occurred. 
 
 

 
His Honour at [32] referred to the decision in All Services Australia Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2000] FCA 375 ; (2000) 171 ALR 330. In that matter Kiefel J at [11] considered an order under O 62 r 3 was justified where "a party in whose favour costs orders have been made to date should not be required to wait until the finalisation of the proceedings to obtain payment of them", particularly where there have been substantial delays in the proceedings, most commonly caused by unsatisfactory attempts to plead a case requiring additional and unnecessary direction hearings. Graham J in Airservices Australia at [33] held that the circumstances clearly brought the case into the category "where, if costs are to be ordered by reference to the changes that have been proposed or made to the Application and/or pleadings of the applicant, then justice requires" that the applicant who has put the respondents to unnecessary expense should pay such costs as are thrown away and these should be paid forthwith. Indemnity costs or party and party costs --- the principles
  
 
 
 
 
 22 Each party referred me to a number of cases which discuss the relevant principles. The respondents emphasised statements to the effect that the court's power to order that the costs of an interlocutory proceeding be paid forthwith is exercised only in very special circumstances ( Vasyli v AOL International Pty Ltd (unreported, Lehane J, 2 September 1996)). The applicants referred to statements in the authorities to the effect that the power to order that the costs of an interlocutory proceeding be paid forthwith should be used less sparingly than it has in the past: ( Airservices Australia v Jeppesen Sanderson Inc [2006] FCA 906 at [31] per Graham J). 
 

 
 
 23 In addition to the authorities which I have mentioned, I refer to Spotwire Pty Ltd v Visa International Service Association (No 2) [2004] FCA 571 at [103] - [109] per Bennett J; IO Group Inc v Prestige Club Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1147 at [20] - [25] per Flick J; McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 at [13]- [20], [24], [41] per Weinberg J; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 952 at [24] per Gordon J; and Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [35] . 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] TASSC 103">&#8226; Costs incurred by reason of an ill-considered pleading may give rise to an exception to the principle that the costs await the final resolution of the issues between the parties. &#8226; In ordinary circumstances, it would be inappropriate that an unsuccessful party in an interlocutory proceeding be required to pay costs immediately, since that party might ultimately be entitled to an order for costs in the substantive proceeding. "
 24 The specific comments of Weinberg J in the McKellar case which are the subject of the plaintiffs' submission, have been repeated with apparent approval in subsequent cases; see for instance Airservices Australia v Jeppesen Sanderson Inc [2006] FCA 906 at [31] ; O'Keefe v Lloyd [2009] FCA 812 at [20] . In some cases, specific reference has been made both to the general rule being departed from only in "rare cases" or in "very special circumstances", and also to Weinberg J's comments, without discussion as to any modification to the way in which the principle is traditionally expressed or applied; see for example Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (No 3) (above) at [21], and Rafferty v Time 2000 West Pty Limited (No 3) (above) at 509 [22]. Discussion 
 25 I think it is important to consider some fundamental aspects of the exercise of the costs discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 1190">I have had regard to the fact that use of the scale in Schedule 1 would facilitate such an approach were I minded to adopt it, but also to all of the circumstances of the case and the authorities cited. In Airservices Australia v Jeppesen Sanderson Inc [2006] FCA 906 Graham J referred to the general principal in O.62 r.3 but went onto state at [31] (by reference to the remarks of Weinberg J in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 at [41] ) that "[i] n lengthy and complex cases where substantial costs have been thrown away as a result of ill-considered pleadings being drawn, the power to order that costs thrown away be paid forthwith should be used less sparingly than it has in the past , on the basis that "[s] uch costs should be capable of being recovered without the innocent party having to wait, possibly years, for that to occur ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 1189">I have had regard to the fact that use of the scale in Schedule 1 would facilitate such an approach were I minded to adopt it, but also to all of the circumstances of the case and the authorities cited.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 812">It remains then to deal with Mr Coleman's application to have those costs payable forthwith. The power of the court to order costs to be payable forthwith is conferred by O 62, r 3. The principles upon which that power is to be exercised are not as comprehensively established as those which govern amendments, but have been considered by Graham J in Airservices Australia v Jeppesen Sanderson Inc [2006] FCA 906. In that case his Honour said at [31]: 
 In lengthy and complex cases where substantial costs have been thrown away as a result of ill-considered pleadings being drawn, the power to order that costs thrown away be paid forthwith should be used less sparingly than it has in the past. Such costs should be capable of being recovered without the innocent party having to wait, possibly years, for that to occur.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1878">15 There remains, however, a basis upon which the discretion can properly be exercised. The discretion may be exercised where, for example, costs have been incurred " as a result of ill-considered pleadings being drawn ": see Airservices Australia v Jepperson [2006] FCA 906 at [31] per Graham J. See also Shahid v The Australasian College of Dermatologists [2006] FCA 414 at [5] ---[6] per Nicholson J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCA 1165">11 In Shahid v The Australasian College of Dermatologists [2006] FCA 414 at [5] - [6] I said:
 
 'The respondent relies on the reasoning in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 and Sereika v Cardinal Financial Securities Ltd (formerly Inteq Custodians Ltd) [2001] FCA 687. 
 
 In McKellar , Weinberg J followed the approach taken by Branson J in Life Airbag Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Co (New Zealand) Ltd [1998] FCA 545 and Kiefel J in Harris v Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-445. In Harris , Kiefel J accepted that an order that certain costs be taxed and paid forthwith was justified in circumstances where there had been a long delay in the course of the proceeding by the pursuit of an ill-considered and unnecessary claim. It is common ground that the making of the order sought by the notice of motion is a matter in the discretion of the Court. ' 

In Airservices Australia v Jeppersen Sanderson Inc [2006] FCA 906 at [31] - [32] Graham J said:
 
 'In lengthy and complex cases where substantial costs have been thrown away as a result of ill-considered pleadings being drawn, the power to order that costs thrown away be paid forthwith should be used less sparingly than it has in the past. Such costs should be capable of being recovered without the innocent party having to wait, possibly years, for that to occur (per Weinberg J in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Limited [1999] FCA 1639 at [41] ).
