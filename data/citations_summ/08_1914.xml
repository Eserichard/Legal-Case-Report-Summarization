<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1147">There is, furthermore, assistance to be found in relatively recent authority in the Federal Court. In Scott v Charitopoulos [2008] FCA 1914 , Finkelstein J dealt with circumstances where there was a controversy about the extent to which an order of the Taxing Master following a taxation was a final judgment for the purposes of s.40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1074">The question of the validity of the bankruptcy notice then came before Finklestein J. in the Federal Court in the Scott v Charitopoulos [2008] FCA 1914. His Honour had decided Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Horvath (Junior) . He considered that his reasoning in that case was correct and that Scott v Evia Pty Ltd was wrongly decided.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 4">Mr Honeysett's counsel made submissions that a first instance costs order, even in relation to an interlocutory application in unfinalised proceedings, is a 'final judgment or final order' within s.40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act , once it has been assessed and entered, citing Re Thompson; ex parte Thompson v Grimley Pty Ltd (1995) 61 FCR 544 at 550 and Goldberg v Morrow [2005] FCA 1038 at [19] (cf. also Scott v Charitopoulos [2008] FCA 1914). However, accepting this, the requirement that a valid bankruptcy notice must be based upon an order whose execution is not stayed is an added condition, which must also be satisfied. </sentence>
