<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] WASCA 231">217 Ordinarily, a decision-maker is not required to disclose to a person to whom procedural fairness must be accorded the decision-maker's mental processes, provisional views or proposed conclusions before a final decision is made. Similarly, the decision-maker is not, ordinarily, obliged to send to a person to whom procedural fairness must be accorded, a draft of a report by the decision-maker which contains findings adverse to the interests of the person, for the purpose of enabling him or her to make comments or submissions. See Minister for Health v Thomson [1985] FCA 208 ; (1985) 8 FCR 213 , 224 (Beaumont J); Alphaone , 590 - 591; Ex parte Palme [22]; OzEpulse Pty Ltd v Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry [2007] FCA 1601 ; (2007) 163 FCR 562 [55] (Emmett J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] NSWLEC 165">This would "ordinarily require the party affected to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material" ( Alphaone at 590 --- 591. See also Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme (2003) 216 CLR 212 at [22] and SZBEL at [32] citing Alphaone ). This involves an entitlement to have the party's mind "directed to the critical issues or factors on which the decision is likely to turn" if those matters are not obvious from the nature of the decision or the terms of the statute under which it is made ( OzEpulse Pty Ltd v Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestr y [2007] FCA 1601 ; (2007) 163 FCR 562 at [55] --- [56]). 115 Administrative decision-making is "not necessarily to be held invalid because the procedures of adversary litigation are not fully observed" ( Kioa v West at 628 --- 629 and South Sydney City Council at [251]). Nor must a decision-maker disclose their "thinking processes or proposed conclusions" ( Victims Compensation Fund Corporation v Nguyen [2001] NSWCA 264 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 213 at [40] ).</sentence>
