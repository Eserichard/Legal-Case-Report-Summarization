<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 12">The delay in finalising this matter is partly due to the fact that the decision before us is the second decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; [2010] AATA 12. The first decision ([2005] AATA 72; [2005] AATA 72 ; 58 ATR 1226 ; (2005) ATC 2038) , by SM Lindsey, was successfully appealed to the Federal Court of Australia ([2007] FCA 415) where Lindgren J remitted the matter to the Tribunal for fresh determination. The new determination was, however, limited to apportionment of the $8.8 million component. On the further hearing, DP Block and SM Frost determined that the income of GCC should be reduced by $1,598,328 and the income of Clos Farming adjusted appropriately. The matter was remitted to the Commissioner to issue amended assessments. </sentence>

 Re G Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Ltd and Anor and Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 72 
 
 REASONS FOR DECISION 
 
 12 January 2010 Mr J Block, Deputy President
Mr S E Frost, Senior Member 
 
 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
 These applications were originally heard by the Tribunal (constituted by Mr P J Lindsay, Senior Member) over a period of four days in December 2004. In January 2005, Senior Member Lindsay affirmed the objection decisions under review: Re G Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Ltd and Anor and Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 72 ("the original Tribunal decision"). The taxpayers appealed from that decision to the Federal Court. In March 2007, Lindgren J allowed the appeal, set aside the original Tribunal decision and remitted the matter to the Tribunal to be determined according to law. Lindgren J's judgment is reported as Gerard Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 415 ("the Federal Court judgment"). </sentence>
