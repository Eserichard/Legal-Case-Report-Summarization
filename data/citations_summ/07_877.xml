<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 710">In order to properly address this question it is necessary to have regard to all of the material that is before me. [16] It is not necessary to reject or evaluate the weight or acceptability of the evidence or to resolve conflicts at this stage [17] - " the material before the commission must raise some fact or facts which give rise to the hypothesis. When that fact or those facts have been identified, the question for determination is whether the hypothesis is reasonable ". [18] The occurrence or existence of a 'fact' may be assumed or inferred in some cases, but an assumed fact cannot arise in the abstract --- it must be " reasonably open to be inferred from, pointed to or raised by and therefore permitted by the material before the decision maker to give rise to the hypothesis . [19] Nevertheless, a reasonable hypothesis involves more than mere possibility --- a reasonable hypothesis " is a hypothesis pointed to by the facts, even though not proved on the balance of probabilities ". [20] Plainly enough, applying subsection 120A of the Act a hypothesis that is raised on the material will only be a reasonable hypothesis if it is consistent with the applicable statement of principles. Even so, a hypothesis connecting the death of a veteran and the particular service rendered by the veteran must be supported by material pointing to each of the elements that are essential to establish the causal chain. [21] If an essential link in the hypothetical chain linking the death of the veteran and the circumstances of his relevant service, as required by a statement of principles for example, is not pointed to or raised by the material, and is merely asserted as a possibility or left open, then it follows that the hypothesis of connection is not raised and, to the extent that it is not consistent with the requirements of the applicable statement of principles, it is not reasonable. [22]  It is common ground that metastatic carcinoma and carcinoma of the prostate caused Mr Myers' death. For the purposes of section 120A of the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act), [6] the 'kind of death' Mr Myers suffered was malignant neoplasm of the prostate. </sentence>

We refer also to Repatriation Commission v Bey [1997] FCA 1347 ; (1997) 79 FCR 364 where in their joint judgment, Northrop, Sundberg, Marshall and Merkell JJ said in effect (at pages 372.9 to 373.1) that a "reasonable hypothesis" involves more than a mere possibility, and is an hypothesis pointed to by the evidence, even though not proved on the balance of probabilities.

 Section 120(1) of the [VE] Act assumes the existence of a relevant injury or disease and provides a standard of proof for the determination of whether that injury or disease was war-caused. When the Commission, or the Tribunal on review, is required to determine whether a veteran is suffering from a particular injury or disease, that issue must be decided to the reasonable satisfaction of the decision-maker, in accordance with s 120(4) of the [VE] Act: see Repatriation Commission v Budworth [2001] FCA 1421 ; (2001) 116 FCR 200 at 204, [15] . See also Repatriation Commission v Cooke (1998) 90 FCR 307 ( Cooke ) at 310 per French J (as he then was), Drummond and Carr JJ; Repatriation Commission v Hancock [2003] FCA 711 ; (2003) 37 AAR 383 ( Hancock ) at [9] per Selway J; Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 ; (2007) 95 ALD 619 ( Codd ) at [22] per Gordon J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCAFC 90">If one of the multiple medical conditions is a cause of death and that condition was itself caused by war service, then that may be sufficient to establish an entitlement to a pension (see Repatriation Commission v Hancock [2003] FCA 711 at [8]). ... The question of the kind of death met by a veteran is a question of medical causation of the death, although that might include contributing or underlying causes in the sense to which I have already referred (see, for example, Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 ; (2007) 95 ALD 619 at [31] and [39]). That is to say, if there is a cause that contributes to the ultimate cause of death, then that cause may have some relevance. The factual finding made by the Tribunal in the present case, however, is that, while the ischemic heart disease may have caused the Veteran's death to occur hours or days earlier, it did not in any way contribute to the pulmonary embolism, which was the actual cause of death.  18 It is common ground that there are necessarily antecedent inquiries before applying ss 120 and 120A as explained by the " Deledio principles". They are:
 
1. whether the claimant was a veteran, or a dependant of a deceased veteran;
 
2. whether the veteran has suffered an injury or disease or has died: see Repatriation Commission v Hancock [2003] FCA 711 ; (2003) 37 AAR 383 ( Hancock ) at [9] per Selway J; and
 
3. the nature or kind of injury or disease suffered by the veteran, or in the case of a claim under s 13(1)(a) the cause of death or the "kind of death" of the veteran: see Hancock at [9] per Selway J; Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 ; (2007) 95 ALD 619 ( Codd ) at [22] per Gordon J. It was made plain in Repatriation Commission v Cooke (1998) 90 FCR 307 ( Cooke ) at 310 per French J (as he then was), Drummond and Carr JJ that ss 120 and 120A assume the existence of a relevant injury or disease or a death which is attributable to a medical cause or causes. Benjamin v Repatriation Commission [2001] FCA 1879 ; (2001) 70 ALD 622 ( Benjamin ) at 635 also recognised that matter. The Full Court (Moore, Emmett and Allsop JJ) at 634-5 [54] said:
 Section 120(1) of the [VE] Act assumes the existence of a relevant injury or disease and provides a standard of proof for the determination of whether that injury or disease was war-caused.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] AATA 560">The purpose of addressing the issue of the relevant kind of death is to establish which Statements of Principles (SoP) apply to the claim ( Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 ; (2007) 95 ALD 619 at 626). The kind of death to be considered is the medical cause of death including the contributing or underlying medical cause of death ( Codd at 627 ) . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] AATA 418">There are conflicting Federal Court authorities about whether we must test the kind of death against any SoP in force before we determine the kind of death. The requirement that we first determine the 'kind of death' that the veteran met is confirmed in Repatriation Commission v Hancock [2003] FCA 711 ; (2003) 37 AAR 383 ('Hancock'), Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 ; (2007) 95 ALD 619 ('Codd') and in Collins v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1982 ('Collins'). </sentence>

In Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 ; (2007) 95 ALD 619 Gordon J at paragraph 39: 
 
 [39] On the proper construction of the VE Act, consistent with its evident statutory purpose and existing authority, the "kind of death met by the [veteran]" that is to be considered is the question of medical causation or the kind of death, being a medical cause of death, including the contributing or underlying medical cause of death.

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] AATA 378">In Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 ; (2007), 95 ALD 619 , Gordon J said at para 11: 
 
 The threshold question posed by s 120(3) is whether the whole of the material before the decision raises a reasonable hypothesis connecting the veteran's death with the circumstances of his service, 
 

and at para 12:
 
 
 A reasonable hypothesis within s 120(3) of the VE Act is a hypothesis that is pointed to by the material before the decision-maker, and not merely left open (or not excluded) by that material. 
 

In contrast the test posed in Bushell and East was couched in terms of some fact or facts (the 'raised facts'). The raised facts have been interpreted on many occasions to be those supporting the hypothesis, with those opposing the hypothesis being considered under s120(1). The term kind of death is a legal not a medical concept. There is considerable precedent dealing with the concept in the setting of widows' claims for pension. In Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 ; (2007), 95 ALD 619 Gordon J said:

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCA 270">In Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 ; (2007) 95 ALD 619 Gordon J observed (at [20]) that the Deledio methodology is subject to three qualifications. Firstly, the methodology is not to be applied mechanistically; secondly, if no SoP is in force reference must be had to s 120A(4) of the VE Act which provides that s 120A(3) does not apply in certain circumstances; and thirdly there are two preliminary steps to the Deledio analysis as expounded by Selway J in Hancock . Such steps were identified at [11] as follows: 
 (a) First, the AAT was required to determine, on balance of probabilities, whether the pre-conditions other than causation, had been made out...
 (b) Next, the AAT was required to determine on balance of probabilities what "kind of death" [the veteran] had suffered. This involved the identification, on balance of probabilities, of any and all [SoP] and/or determinations under s 180A(2) of the Act and any other "kinds of death" which were applicable to that death. (c) If one or more [SoP] were applicable, then the methodology in Deledio is applicable in relation to those "kinds of death"... 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FCA 1982">21 The question of the kind of death met by a veteran is a question of medical causation of the death, although that might include contributing or underlying causes in the sense to which I have already referred (see, for example, Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 ; (2007) 95 ALD 619 at [31] and [39]). That is to say, if there is a cause that contributes to the ultimate cause of death, then that cause may have some relevance. The factual finding made by the Tribunal in the present case, however, is that, while the ischemic heart disease may have caused the Veteran's death to occur hours or days earlier, it did not in any way contribute to the pulmonary embolism, which was the actual cause of death. </sentence>

See Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877. At [31] - [43], Gordon J held that the Tribunal had characterised the kind of death met by the deceased incorrectly. The hypothesis was not that death was by road accident, but that death arose out of, or was attributable to, alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse. Accordingly, the Tribunal ought to have tested the hypothesis against the statement of principles for alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse. Again, the Commission appealed to the Federal Court. On 15 June 2007, the Court again set aside the Tribunal's decision made on 24 October 2006 and remitted the matter to the Tribunal to be heard and determined according to law by a differently constituted Tribunal.

<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] AATA 736">The next step, applying the same reasonable satisfaction standard, is for the Tribunal to determine the 'kind of death' Mr Pleming suffered for the purposes of s 120A of the VE Act. [12] In order to determine the 'kind of death' it is necessary to consider the medical conditions that caused the particular death, and there may be more than one such cause. [13] Furthermore, the Tribunal is to establish the real or operative cause of the death and not merely the medical event by which life was terminated. Whether or not a particular illness or disease can fairly and properly be considered the cause of death must be determined in the particular circumstances on the balance of probabilities.  The question is whether one or more of these hypotheses connecting the deceased veteran's death with the circumstances of his operational service is raised on the material that is before me. In order to properly address this question it is necessary to have regard to all of the material. [20] It is not necessary to reject or evaluate the weight or acceptability of the evidence or to resolve conflicts at this stage. [21] Nevertheless, a reasonable hypothesis involves more than mere possibility. [22] If an essential link in the hypothetical chain linking the death of the veteran and the circumstances of his relevant service is not pointed to or raised by the material and is merely asserted or left open, then it follows that the hypothesis of connection is not so raised and is not reasonable.

 31 The phrase "kind of death met by the person" in s 120A(4) asks a causative question. It is not a question about whether the death was slow, fast or the like. It asks "questions of medical causation" about the cause of death and does so in a particular context --- the VE Act and, in particular, Part VIII of the VE Act: see also Explanatory Memorandum to the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 (Cth) pp i-ii.

Mr Purcell argued that Codd required in this case that the veteran's death must be found to have been a war-caused disease. Therefore, as the medical evidence was that "heart failure" was a condition and not a "disease", it cannot be regarded as a "contributing or underlying cause of the veteran's death" within the context of the Act as discussed by Gordon J in Codd . </sentence>

<sentence id="cs25" from="[2007] AATA 1879">Thus, Dr Byrnes, who certified the veteran's death, identified ischaemic heart disease as playing a role in the veteran's death in addition to the medical conditions that he had identified on the death certificate. As the Federal Court said in Repatriation Commission v Towns [2003] FCA 1262 , the expression kind of death is wide reaching and not limited to the prime cause of death in a medical sense. The Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 ; (2007) 95 ALD 619 stated that the question of kind of death looks to the medical cause of death including the underlying or contributing causes. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2007] FCAFC 126">34 However, the statements in Deledio and in the later cases, do not exclude the necessity to first decide, if necessary by making appropriate findings of fact, whether a Statement of Principles applies to 'the kind of death' (or 'kind of injury' or 'kind of disease') which gives rise to the claim under consideration (see also Repatriation Commission v Hancock [2003] FCA 711 ; (2003) 37 AAR 383 at [11] and Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 at [22] --- [23]). There is no Statement of Principles for drowning or for coronary artery disease although there is for ischaemic heart disease. An important initial question for the AAT was, therefore, to decide what caused Mr Byrne's death in order to establish whether a relevant Statement of Principles applied. That conclusion was required to be reached on the balance of probabilities (s 120(4)). Of necessity, it required findings of fact to be made.  That case failed. Counsel for the appellant proposed two hypotheses in the event that the "kind of death" was found to be drowning (as it was). There was (and has been) no discussion in this case as to whether "drowning" is a "kind of death" referred to in s 120A(4) (cf Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877). The first hypothesis can be put aside. The second hypothesis was that Mr Byrne suffered from war caused IHD that impaired his ability to survive being thrown into Tantagara Dam after his boat had capsized (leading to his death by drowning).</sentence>

The Deledio methodology is subject to at least three important qualifications which are not presently directly relevant: see Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 at [20] - [22]. 
  6 In Repatriation Commission v Codd [2007] FCA 877 at [9] - [24] I described the statutory framework in the following terms. The standard of proof to be applied in determining whether a claim for a pension in respect of the incapacity from injury or disease of a veteran was war-caused is prescribed by ss 120(1) and (3) of the VE Act . Section 120 of the VE Act relevantly provides:
 
 
 "(1) Where a claim under Part II for a pension in respect of the incapacity from injury or disease of a veteran, or of the death of a veteran, relates to the operational service rendered by the veteran, the Commission shall determine ... that the disease was a war-caused disease ... unless it is satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that there is no sufficient ground for making that determination. 
 ... 
 (3) In applying subsection (1) or (2) in respect of the incapacity of a person from ... disease ... related to service rendered by the person, the Commission shall be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that there is no sufficient ground for determining: 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) that the disease was a war-caused disease or a defence-caused disease; 
 
 
 
 
 
 ... if the Commission, after consideration of the whole of the material before it, is of the opinion that the material before it does not raise a reasonable hypothesis connecting the ... disease ... with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person. " </sentence>
