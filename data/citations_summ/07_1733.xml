<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 518">The parties acknowledge in their joint submissions that 2 of the 7 persons named as the applicant have died since the application was amended in 1999. A question therefore arises as to whether the other 5 persons are authorised to deal with all matters arising in relation to the application pursuant to the Native Title Act . Where the terms of the authorisation encompass and accommodate the death or incapacity of any one, or more, of the persons named as applicant, for example, by making express provision for the on-going or continuing authorisation of the remaining persons who comprise the applicant following the death or incapacity of any other named applicant, the remaining person or persons named applicants may continue to deal with all matters arising under the Native Title Act in relation to the application: Anderson v Western Australia [2007] FCA 1733 at [37] ; Coyne v Western Australia [2009] FCA 533 at [56] ; Roe v Western Australia (No. 2) [2011] FCA 102 at [149] ; cf Lennon v South Australia [2010] FCA 743. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 516">The parties acknowledge in their joint submissions that 7 of the 15 persons named as the applicant are now deceased since the application was filed in 1999. A question therefore arises as to whether the other 8 persons are authorised to deal with all matters arising in relation to the application pursuant to the Native Title Act . Where the terms of the authorisation encompass and accommodate the death or incapacity of any one, or more, of the persons named as applicant, for example, by making express provision for the on-going or continuing authorisation of the remaining persons who comprise the applicant following the death or incapacity of any other named applicant, the remaining person or persons named as applicant may continue to deal with all matters arising under the Native Title Act in relation to the application: Anderson v Western Australia [2007] FCA 1733 at [37] ; Coyne v Western Australia [2009] FCA 533 at [56] ; Roe v Western Australia (No. 2) [2011] FCA 102 at [149] ; cf Lennon v South Australia [2010] FCA 743. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 102">(e) Resolution 5 does not provide any basis for concluding that if some but not all of the persons authorised to be the applicant are not eligible, that the remaining eligible persons are authorised to continue to act as the applicant. The fact that resolution 6 makes no provision for what should happen in that event reinforces that conclusion. (f) In Anderson v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 1733 French J considered the effect of a resolution authorising certain named persons "or such of them as are willing and able to act in respect of the application in the future" to be the applicant in circumstances where one of the individuals had died since authorisation was given. French J found at [37] that authorisation was subject, in the case of each individual, to his or her continuing willingness or capacity to act. The death of one of the authorised persons meant that the balance of the named applicants were authorised by the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 743">The resolution relevantly authorised the named persons "... or such of them as are eligible to act as an applicant and who remain willing and able to act in respect of the application in the future" to make and deal with matters arising in relation to the application. The authorisation itself therefore encompassed and accommodated that circumstance. His Honour followed a decision of French J (as he then was) in Anderson v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 1733 where a similar circumstance had arisen in relation to a similarly worded authorisation, albeit under the statutory regime which existed prior to the 2007 Amending Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1110">I am satisfied that, on that evidence, the authorisation meeting was sufficiently representative of the native title claim group to be competent to make decisions on behalf of the claim group for the purposes of s 251B of the Act. (See, Anderson v Western Australia [2007] FCA 1733 at [36] . ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 533">

 
 40 French J had cause again to consider the question of whether a meeting of a claim group was sufficiently representative to comprise the source of the revocation of the authority of the existing applicant and the authorisation of a replacement applicant, in the case of Anderson v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 1733 ( Anderson ).</sentence>
