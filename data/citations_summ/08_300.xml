<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 913">Both of those areas of the original application have now been abandoned, properly, in my opinion. The latter area faced substantial difficulties due to the specific exclusions from this Court's jurisdiction of the review of administrative actions and decisions taken under s.48B and s. 417 (see s. 476 (2)(d) and my judgment in SZLJM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor (2007) 215 FLR 115 , [2007] FMCA 1945 , upheld by Flick J in SZLJM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 300). These exclusions appear to remain effective, notwithstanding a possible need to revisit previous jurisprudence on administrative processes concerning 'non-compellable' powers, in the light of Plaintiff M61/2010E v Commonwealth of Australia; Plaintiff M69 of 2010 v Commonwealth of Australia [2010] HCA 41. I observe, however, that the exclusions under s.476(2)(d) by reference to s.474(7) do not include the Minister's non-compellable power under s.46A , which was addressed by the High Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 937">The degree of doubt contemplated by the test in Jarratt does not, in my view, attend the learned Magistrate's reasons. His decision was based upon the reasons of Lindgren J in Raikua , a case in which his Honour very fully discussed and explained the operation of s 417, and, relevantly, rejected the construction of the section for which the applicant now contends --- see, esp, at 523. In Raikua , Lindgren J, at 523, derived support from the reasoning of a Full Court of this Court in Bedlington v Chong (supra), and, since then, his Honour's judgment has been described as "manifestly correct": SZLJM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 300 , per Flick J, at [9]. Accepting the correctness of the statements of principle in Raikua , therefore, it was for the applicant to point to some difference of fact or circumstance which rendered those principles inapplicable. He has failed to do so, either in the Magistrates' Court or in this Court. It follows that, if this matter were to proceed to trial, the construction of s 417 for which the applicant contends would have to be rejected. For that reason, as I said, I am unable to hold that the requisite degree of doubt attends the Federal Magistrate's decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 299">6 In the present Application it is considered that leave to appeal should be refused. The decision of the Federal Magistrate was correct. There is no relevant distinction between either ss 351 or 417 and no distinction between the present case and the decision in Raikua v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 370 , 158 FCR 510. It is considered that the application has no prospects of success for the reasons given in SZJLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 300. </sentence>
