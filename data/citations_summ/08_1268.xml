<citphrase id="cp0.0" type=cited from="[2007] WAIRComm 435">the issue this is an application for leave to appeal and an appeal if leave is granted, about whether the commission at first instance erred in not finding the appellant to be a trading corporation and therefore a " constitutional corporation ". (for ease of reference, both the application and appeal may be collectively referred to as " the appeal "). the consequence of this finding was that the commission had jurisdiction to hear and determine the respondent's application for a remedy in respect of his alleged unfair dismissal. it was not in contest between the parties at first instance or on appeal that if the appellant was a trading corporation the commission would not have jurisdiction because of the contents of s5 , s 6 and s 16 of the workplace relations act 1996 (cth) ( the wra ) and s109 of the constitution . (see sewell v glenn brown</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp0.1" type=cited from="[2007] WAIRComm 435">cti logistics (2006) 86 waig 3278 per kenner c at paragraphs [15]-[19]).  the proceedings at first instance the application was filed on 18 august 2006, pursuant to s29(1)(b) of the industrial relations act 1979 (wa) ( the act ). it contended that on or about 21 july 2006 the respondent's employment as a solicitor with the appellant was terminated harshly, oppressively and unfairly. the appellant filed a notice of answer and counter proposal which opposed the respondent's claim. the answer did not raise any objection to jurisdiction. this occurred subsequently following a change in the appellant's solicitors. the appellant's new solicitors, who remained their solicitors for the appeal, advised the commission that the appellant intended to raise as a preliminary issue, that it is a trading corporation for the purposes of s51(xx) of the commonwealth constitution and s4 of the wra . as a result, the original dates listed to hear the application at first instance were vacated and directions were made to hear the objection to jurisdiction. this included the service of notices pursuant to s78b of the judiciary act 1903 (cth). the evidence before the commission on the preliminary issue, was primarily in the form of affidavits filed by the parties which annexed relevant documents. for the appellant, affidavits were sworn/affirmed by mr dennis eggington, the chief executive officer of the appellant, and mr andrew grist, the in-house accountant of the appellant. the respondent also affirmed an affidavit. the commission heard the preliminary issue on 17 november 2006. at the hearing the affidavits were formally received into evidence and mr eggington was cross-examined. the commission reserved its decision. on 19 december 2006 the commission published its reasons for decision. it concluded that the appellant was not a trading corporation and accordingly the application should be re-listed for the hearing of the substantive claim. as stated the appeal is against the decision of the commission that it had jurisdiction to determine the substantive claim, on the basis that the appellant was not a trading corporation.  section 78b of the judiciary act 1903 (cth) and intervention by the minister as instructed, my associate wrote to the appellant's solicitors, with a copy to the respondent's solicitors, on 25 january 2007 to request that notices be issued to attorneys general under s78b of the judiciary act 1903 (cth). this request was complied with by the appellant's solicitors on 31 january 2007. by the time of the hearing of the appeal, all of the attorneys general had advised the appellant that they did not wish to intervene in the appeal. on the day before the hearing of the appeal, however, the full bench received notice from the state solicitor's office, acting on behalf of the minister for employment protection, that the minister was going to seek the leave of the full bench to intervene. this was pursuant to s30(1) of the act . an outline of submissions on behalf of the minister was received later that day. at the commencement of the hearing, leave was granted to the minister to intervene. there was no opposition to the full bench taking this course and the full bench considered, given the subject matter of the appeal, that it was appropriate to grant leave.  leave to appeal the decision by the commission at first instance that the appellant was not a trading corporation and therefore the commission had jurisdiction, was a " finding " as defined in s7 of the act . this is because the decision made by the commission did not finally decide, determine or dispose of the respondent's application. as such, the appellant faces the hurdle of s49(2a) of the act in seeking to appeal against the finding. section 49(2a) provides that an " appeal does not lie under this section from a finding unless, in the opinion of the full bench, the matter is of such importance that, in the public interest, an appeal should lie ". in the schedule to the notice of appeal, the appellant said that the matter of what constitutes a trading corporation for the purpose of the definition of constitutional corporation in the wra is now central to whether the commission has jurisdiction in relation to corporations in unfair dismissal matters. the schedule said that of itself, further and alternatively because the full bench has not previously considered the matter, it is of such importance that it is in the public interest that leave to appeal be granted. in their written outline of submissions, the appellant contended that leave ought to be granted for an additional reason. this was that it was desirable in the public interest for the appellant's attention and resources to be directed to and expended on continuing to perform the contract which it had with the commonwealth, to provide services to indigenous persons, without the inconvenience of having to further engage in litigation in this matter. the submissions added that the appellant would in any event be entitled to appeal against the final decision of the commission on the ground raised in the appeal. (this probably assumes the substantive application would be decided against the appellant). the respondent opposed the granting of leave. the first basis for this was a submission that the issue on appeal was a fairly narrow one and did not involve an issue so broadly relating to the jurisdiction of the commission as described by the appellant. the second basis was that the additional or alternative contention of the appellant offended the notion of all parties being equal before the law. the minister made no submissions on this issue. in our opinion on the basis of the first ground argued by the appellant, it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal. this is because the appeal requires the full bench to consider the correctness of the approach taken by the commission in determining the question of whether the appellant is a trading corporation. also in our opinion the appeal does involve a consideration of what is meant by trading corporation and trading. these issues are all important because of the consequence of a determination of whether a corporation is a trading corporation, for the jurisdiction of the commission. in murdoch university v lhmu (2005) 86 waig 247 we set out, with the agreement of gregor sc and smith c, the meaning of the public interest requirement contained in s49(2a) of the act as follows:</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp0.2" type=cited from="[2007] WAIRComm 435">" 12 the appellant accepted that the order made by the commission was a "finding" as defined in s7 of the act. this was because the order did not finally dispose of the matter before the commission at first instance. accordingly, the appellant also accepted that s49(2a) of the act applied to the appeal. this subsection provides that an appeal does not lie from a finding unless, in the opinion of the full bench, the matter is of such importance that, in the public interest, an appeal should lie. the subsection focuses the attention of the full bench upon "the matter". it seems that a determination is to be made as to whether the matter, as opposed to individual appeal grounds, is of such importance that, in the public interest, an appeal should lie. accordingly, it seems that the full bench may not form the opinion that an appeal should lie on only some of the grounds.   in rria v amwsu and others (1989) 69 waig 1873 , the full bench at 1879 said that the words "public interest" in s49(2a) of the act should not be narrowed to mean "special or extraordinary circumstances". as stated by the full bench, an application may involve circumstances which are neither special nor extraordinary but which are, because of their very generality, of great importance in the public interest. the full bench, on the same page, went on to say that important questions with likely repercussions in other industries and substantial matters of law affecting jurisdiction can give rise to matters of sufficient importance in the public interest to justify an appeal. the rria decision was cited with approval and applied in the recent full bench decision of csa v shean (2005) 85 waig 2993 at 2995-2997.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] SAIRComm 1">Kaufman SDP went on to reference the principles adopted in the judgement of Justice Spender in Australian Workers Union of Employees, Queensland v Etheridge Shire Council [6] and concluded they were similar in nature. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] WAIRComm 1149">When considering whether Etheridge Shire Council was a constitutional corporation, Spender J in The Australian Workers' Union of Employees, Queensland v Etheridge Shire Council [2008] FCA 1268 ; (2008) 250 ALR 485 analysed in detail what was said by each judge in St George County Council [48] - [66] . Justice Spender noted that the majority of the court in Adamson favoured the minority reasoning of Barwick CJ in St George County Council [67] . Justice Spender went on to consider the judgment of Toohey J in Hughes and observed: 
"The comment by the majority in the Work Choices case that the view of Barwick CJ 'did not then command the assent of the majority of the court' is to be understood as indicating that the 'activities test' propounded by Barwick CJ was later accepted by the High Court in Adamson as the applicable test, and is the proper test to apply. This was also the approach in Australian Workers' Union of Employees, Queensland &amp; Ors v. Etheridge Shire Council &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 1268 ; (2008) 171 FCR 102 ; 250 ALR 485 ( Etheridge ). This decision is a recent case before the Federal Court concerning precisely the issue of whether a local government council is, or is not, a trading or a financial corporation and I consider it both helpful and relevant in the context of this appeal. In Etheridge , Spender J considered what is the proper test to apply and stated the question as being (at [85], ALR 501): 
"I therefore proceed to inquire whether the Etheridge Shire Council is a trading corporation or a financial corporation, by considering whether, on the evidence, 'the predominant and characteristic activity of the Etheridge Shire Council is trading, whether in goods or services', or whether 'the predominant and characteristic activity of the Etheridge Shire Council is in finance'. "
 
  The question of whether a local government is a trading corporation has not been considered by the Industrial Appeal Court. There are however two decisions of single justices of the Federal Court of Australia which have considered this question. In both cases it was decided the local government was not a trading corporation for the purposes of the Constitution . These cases are Australian Workers' Union of Employees, Queensland v Etheridge Shire Council [2008] FCA 1268 ; (2008) 171 FCR 102 and Mid Density Development Pty Ltd v Rockdale Municipal Council [1992] FCA 634 ; (1993) 39 FCR 579. In Etheridge Shire Council the local government body was constituted under the Local Government Act 1993 (Qld) and in Rockdale Municipal Council the local government body was constituted under the Local Government Act 1919 (NSW). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] NSWIRComm 173">54 Reference should also be made to the judgment of Spender J of the Federal Court in Australian Workers' Union of Employees, Queensland v Etheridge Shire Council [2008] FCA 1268. In this case the issue was whether the Shire Council, as a Local Government body, was a trading or financial corporation to which s 51(xx) of the Constitution applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCAFC 95">
 Before the Court is an appeal from orders of a single Judge, Australian Workers' Union of Queensland v Etheridge Shire Council [2009] FCA 58 ("the Costs Judgment"), rendered in consequence of a ruling on an application for the costs of the primary proceeding in which his Honour's reasons are to be found in Australian Workers' Union of Queensland v Etheridge Shire Council [2008] FCA 1268 ; (2008) 171 FCR 102 ("the Primary Judgment"). The question upon which this appeal turns is whether, upon the proper construction of s 824 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the WR Act "), the primary proceeding involved a matter "arising under" the WR Act , so that prima facie each party should have borne its own costs of the primary proceeding. Otherwise, the Court should have exercised the discretion conferred by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Federal Court Act ") which requires consideration of whether to apply the "normal rule" that costs follow the event. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] WAIRComm 455">The applicant argues that the characterisation of a corporation as a trading corporation should be determined by primarily focusing on the activities of the corporation (see Australian Workers' Union of Employees, Queensland v Etheridge Shire Council (2008) FCA 1268 at paragraph 146). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 58">On 20 August 2008, I delivered judgment in both of these matters, finding for the applicants in each case: Australian Workers' Union of Employees, Queensland and Others v Etheridge Shire Council and Another [2008] FCA 1268 ; (2008) 171 FCR 102 ; (2008) 250 ALR 485 ; and [2008] FCA 1268 ; (2008) 175 IR 383. At that time, I indicated that I would hear the parties as to costs in the matters. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 1148">The evidence in this case indicates that Considine Architects is the business name of a firm run by Mr Considine as a sole trader. At best for the Applicant (on the Applicant's own evidence) the firm might be a partnership ("his partner Phil at the time") [18] but the evidence is so flimsy that the Court could not properly arrive at that conclusion. The evidence is that Considine Architects is not a body corporate, and therefore cannot be a corporation as defined in the TP Act . Even if Considine Architects were a body corporate, the evidence is insufficient to establish that it is: a foreign corporation; a financial corporation, that is one involved in finance or financial matters; [19] a trading corporation, that is one whose predominant and characteristic activity is trading, whether in goods or services; [20] or a holding corporation for one of the foregoing types of corporation.
