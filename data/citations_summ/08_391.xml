<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1204">Even without the existence of the public domain exception, this Court has the power to grant leave for the documents used in the Family Court proceedings to be used in this Court: see Jarra Creek Central Packing Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2008] FCA 391 ; Holpitt Pty Ltd v Varimu Pty Ltd (1991) 29 FCR 576 ; Griffiths v Duggan (No 2) [2008] VSC 230. In Griffiths at [7] and [8], the Court noted: 
 
 Whether a document which is subject to an implied undertaking can be used by a party in subsequent proceedings is a matter that may potentially impinge upon the integrity and authority of two sets of judicial processes. That situation is quite different from the case where the subsequent use of a document obtained with an implied undertaking restricting its use is subject only to the continuing authority of the court which first compelled its production. In that case the party wishing to use the document can only do so if permitted by the court to which the implied undertaking is given. That is not this case. Nor is this a case in which the use of Mr Lin's affidavit may adversely impact upon my hearing and consideration of the issues in dispute before me: that dispute is finalised on all issues except costs. 
 

 
 
 Whether it should be used in the second proceeding is a question which is best dealt with by the judge in the second proceeding. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] VSC 157">8 It was accepted by the parties on this application that it was necessary for the plaintiff to demonstrate special circumstances which would warrant the release of the documents for use in this proceeding. [3] In Springfield Nominees Pty Ltd v Bridgelands Securities Ltd, [4] Wilcox J said of the circumstances where it was sought to release documents utilised in one piece of litigation for use in another relevantly connected piece of litigation: 
 
 "For 'special circumstances' to exist it is enough that there is a special feature of the case which affords a reason for modifying or releasing the undertaking and is not usually present. The matter then becomes one of the proper exercise of the Court's discretion. " 
 
 His Honour then set out the factors which may be relevant to determining whether special circumstances exist: 
 
 "It is neither possible nor desirable to propound an exhaustive list of those factors. But plainly they include the nature of the document, the circumstances under which it came into existence, the attitude of the author of the document and any prejudice that the author may sustain, whether the document pre-existed the litigation or was created for that purpose and therefore expected to enter the public domain, the nature of the information in the document (in particular whether it contains personal data or commercially sensitive information), the circumstances in which the documents came into the hands of the applicant for leave and, perhaps most important of all, the likely contribution of the document in achieving justice in the second proceeding. " [5] 
 
 The above considerations have been applied on a number of occasions by this Court and other Courts. [6]

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 370">By analogy with the principles relating to the use of documents produced on discovery, the material produced in answer to subpoenas in the present proceeding may not be used by the Plaintiffs in an examination conducted under Part 5.9 of the Act without either the consent of the producing party or the leave of the Court: see Springfield Nominees Pty Limited v Bridgelands Securities Limited (1992) 38 FCR 217 at 222-3, Central Queensland Cement Pty Ltd v Hardy [1989] 2 QdR 509 at 510 and the authorities collected in the judgment of Tamberlin J in Jarra Creek Central Packing Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 391 at paragraphs [10] to [13]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 39">The Court accepts that the law in respect of the question of disclosure of these affidavits is as summarised in the applicant's outline of submissions at paragraph 6; namely, that: the applicant must show special but not exceptional circumstances, that is, something that takes the matter out of the ordinary course; it is relevant to consider actual prejudice that the respondents may sustain; and the most important consideration is the interests of justice, specifically the likely contribution that the material sought to be disclosed will make to the achievement of justice in the other proceedings, in this case the Federal Court proceedings.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] VSC 230">It is neither possible nor desirable to propound an exhaustive list of those factors. But plainly they include the nature of the document, the circumstances under which it came into existence, the attitude of the author of the document and any prejudice the author may sustain, whether the document pre-existed litigation or was created for that purpose and therefore expected to enter the public domain, the nature of the information in the document (in particular whether it contains personal data or commercially sensitive information), the circumstances in which the document came into the hands of the applicant for leave and, perhaps most important of all, the likely contribution of the document in achieving justice in the second proceedings . [27] (My emphasis)
 
 The case before me in the undertaking proceeding was primarily concerned with whether or not this test had been met. The plaintiffs contended that Mr Lin's affidavit bears upon live issues in the winding up proceeding and in the debt recovery proceeding. They said that in each proceeding there was an issue about whether it is Proline or Mr Lin who is the relevant contracting party. 4 I accept that the affidavit of Mr Lin was received by the plaintiffs, and their lawyers, with an implied undertaking that it not be used for purposes other than the proceeding before me, but I am not persuaded that its use by the plaintiffs in either the winding up proceeding or the debt recovery proceeding needs them to obtain a release. The implied undertaking does not diminish the authority or power of the court in other proceedings and "must give way to any inconsistent statutory provision and to orders of a court in other proceedings for discovery and inspection" [10] , and I would add, any overriding compulsion or duty imposed by law or statute [11] . The court hearing the winding up proceeding or the debt recovery proceeding has full power and authority to ensure that its decision is reached by reference to all material that is necessary and probative in the discharge of its jurisdiction and powers. The proper course for parties such as the plaintiffs is, in my view, to seek in those proceedings access to information and documents that may bear upon the facts and issues in those proceedings. That appears to have been the process followed in Jarra Creek Central Packing Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [12] . I was told from the bar table that discovery had not been sought from Proline in the other proceedings but there was no suggestion of any lack of power in the Court to do so in those proceedings or to issue subpoenas in those proceedings against Mr Lin or the parties who had been defendants in the proceedings before me. Any such step would not be "to make use of the document itself, but to use only the information about it" [13] . Any argument that a party would by that process be able "to gain information to which it would not have access" [14] would be met by the response that if that were so "it follows from the use of the processes of the court itself" [15] and not by any breach of an implied undertaking to the court.  4 I accept that the affidavit of Mr Lin was received by the plaintiffs, and their lawyers, with an implied undertaking that it not be used for purposes other than the proceeding before me, but I am not persuaded that its use by the plaintiffs in either the winding up proceeding or the debt recovery proceeding needs them to obtain a release. The implied undertaking does not diminish the authority or power of the court in other proceedings and "must give way to any inconsistent statutory provision and to orders of a court in other proceedings for discovery and inspection" [10] , and I would add, any overriding compulsion or duty imposed by law or statute [11] .

It may be (as may be the case with Mr Lin's affidavit) that the document, although exchanged and filed in legal proceedings, continues to attract legal professional privilege [22] or by reason of the implied undertaking ought in any subsequent proceeding not be ordered for discovery, production or inspection [23] . However I need not pursue this aspect for three reasons. The first is that the case before me was argued upon the assumption that the proper process for the plaintiffs to follow was to apply to me to release them (or at least some of them) of the implied undertaking that prevented the use of Mr Lin's affidavit in the other proceedings pending in this court, and, therefore I did not have the benefit of full argument on this point. The plaintiffs did not contend that I should not make the orders they were seeking. The defendants and the interveners maintained that the orders should not be made as a matter of substance not that the summons should, or could, not have been issued. Secondly, the decision I have reached in this matter does not depend upon my adopting the view I have expressed about the preferable process. Thirdly, as a matter of power, it is probable that I retain the power to grant the relief sought even though it may be subject to another order by another court. I will proceed therefore, in conformity with the arguments before me, that the plaintiffs need me to release them from the implied undertaking if they are to use Mr Lin's affidavit in the other proceedings. </sentence>
