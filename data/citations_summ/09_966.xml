<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 91">The Tribunal did not simply rely on its error or misunderstanding " in only a peripheral way " ( MZXSA at [85] per Keane CJ, Perram and Yates JJ). While there were other factors relevant to the Tribunal's credibility finding, the Tribunal did not independently make a decision adverse to the applicant. The Tribunal totally overlooked, ignored or disregarded the fact that a claim about the events of January 2009 was made in connection with the applicant's protection visa application and on this basis did not address the content of the claim, except insofar as it concluded, based on its mistaken view about the late timing of the claim, that it was made purely to strengthen the applicant's claims for protection and was not genuine. Such an approach is contrary to that taken in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2003) 77 ALJR 1088 ; [2003] HCA 26. As stated by Collier J in Khanam v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2009) 111 ALD 421 ; [2009] FCA 966 at [30] : Procedural fairness requires the tribunal to give real consideration to the claim of the visa applicant and the merits of his case...failure to do so constitutes a denial of natural justice --- and a jurisdictional defect infecting the decision of the tribunal... </sentence>

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] MRTA 2526">The Departmental guidelines essentially incorporate the considerations that previously were set out in the Minister's Direction, including: personal circumstances that may encourage the applicant to leave Australia at the end of the proposed visit; the applicant's immigration history; personal circumstances in the applicant's home country that may encourage them to remain in Australia; conditions that may encourage the applicant to remain in Australia; the credibility of the applicant in terms of character and conduct; whether the purpose and proposed duration of the applicant's visit, and proposed activities in Australia are reasonable and consistent; and information contained in statistical, intelligence and analysis reports on migration fraud and immigration compliance developed by the department about nationals from the applicant's home country. Such information developed as profiles may assist assessing officers in determining whether closer examination of an application is required to ensure the integrity of the visitor visa program. [2]

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] FMCA 873">The Tribunal did more than make a mistake about a piece of evidence before it. It failed to address an important component of the case presented by Mr Abbas and Mrs Ajaj to prove the genuineness of his intentions to return from Australia. I am satisfied that jurisdictional error similar to the error found by Collier J in Khanam v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 966 , (2009) 111 ALD 421 at [30.5] has been made out. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs13" from="[2010] MRTA 1648">In terms of the potential for the lodgement of a Protection visa application by the visa applicant, the Tribunal notes that the policy guidelines in PAM3 do refer to the possibility that an applicant might apply for a Protection visa. However, the Tribunal has also had regard to the decision in Khanam v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 966 (27 August 2009). In this case the Tribunal (differently constituted) was not satisfied the applicant's intention to visit Australia was genuine for the purposes of clause 679.224, in part, because there was a likelihood that the applicant, an Ahmadi from Pakistan, might apply for a Protection visa in Australia and his parents resided in Australia. The Federal Court held that by finding the applicant's intention to visit was not genuine on the basis of a view regarding the likely intentions of Ahmadi Muslims as a group in applying for subclass 679 visas, rather than considering the particular circumstances of the applicant, the Tribunal had erred. The Court held that in assessing an applicant's genuine intention to visit Australia, the Tribunal should taken into account the applicant's stated reasons for wishing to visit Australia and the visa applicant's motive for doing so. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2010] MRTA 1446">As the Federal Court emphasised in Khanam v MIAC [2009] FCA 966 (27 August 2009), in arriving at the required state of satisfaction in relation to the visa applicant's declared intentions, the Tribunal must have regard to all relevant considerations. While these will certainly include the specific circumstances and claims of the visa applicant, they may well encompass her wider circumstances, including those of any group of which she is a member, to the extent that those circumstances may be relevant to assessing her intentions in applying for the visa and seeking to enter Australia. </sentence>

 Jurisdictional defects in Tribunal's decision
