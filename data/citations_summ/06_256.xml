<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 979">The amount of equitable compensation to which Spotless will be entitled for breach of the employment obligations is the amount necessary to restore Spotless to the position which it would have enjoyed but for the wrongful conduct. The remedy of equitable compensation is more absolute in nature than the common law obligation to pay damages for tort or breach of contract. It is not necessary to consider specifically foreseeability and remoteness. In any event, in the present circumstances, those concepts would not feature so as to limit the recoverable damages. Spotless contends that all it needs to show is "that the breach of duty was a cause of the loss suffered, not the cause". The inquiry is simply whether the loss would have happened if there had been no breach. This has been described as a more stringent causal test than ordinarily applies at common law: see eg O'Halloran v R T Thomas &amp; Family Pty Ltd [1998] NSWSC 596 ; (1998) 45 NSWLR 262 at 272-278; Beach Petroleum NL v Kennedy [1999] NSWCA 408 ; (1999) 48 NSWLR 1 at 90-94; Maguire v Makaronis [1997] HCA 23 ; (1997) 188 CLR 449 ; Southern Real Estate Pty Ltd v Dellow [2003] SASC 318 ; [2003] SASC 318 ; (2003) 87 SASR 1 ; AMP Services Ltd v Manning [2006] FCA 256 at [64] - [69]. </sentence>

 To accept Arrive's argument is to accept the notion that a fiduciary breach effectively "stops the clock" at the time of breach for the purpose of determining what actual loss was suffered by a party and what the party's ultimate "position" would have been. This line of reasoning was rejected by the House of Lords in Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns (a firm) [1995] UKHL 10 ; [1996] 1 AC 421. There, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said (at 439): 
 

 
 
 
 Equitable compensation for breach of trust is designed to achieve exactly what the word compensation suggests: to make good a loss in fact suffered by the beneficiaries and which, using hindsight and common sense, can be seen to have been caused by the breach.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] VSC 115">In addition, I consider that an enforced break from participation in the market place would not have the same effect on Mr Hillard's career as it would on an actor or television presenter. 107 Finally, I do not consider that the reference to part of the notice period being "worked" and payment in lieu being made for a period which was "unworked" really assists in deciding whether or not BearingPoint was entitled to put Mr Hillard on garden leave. Certainly, the wording of this particular provision in Mr Hillard's employment contract is not like the provision considered in AMP Services Ltd v Manning, [32] which Finkelstein J held permitted the employer to require the employee not to attend work for some or all of the notice period while continuing to pay her wages. That paragraph read: 
 
AMP may elect to pay you salary in lieu of notice or require you to work during part or all of your notice period. [33] 
 
But equally, in my opinion, the provision in this case does not mean that BearingPoint is required to provide Mr Hillard with work. Certainly, the wording of this particular provision in Mr Hillard's employment contract is not like the provision considered in AMP Services Ltd v Manning, [32] which Finkelstein J held permitted the employer to require the employee not to attend work for some or all of the notice period while continuing to pay her wages. That paragraph read: 
 
AMP may elect to pay you salary in lieu of notice or require you to work during part or all of your notice period. [33] 
 
But equally, in my opinion, the provision in this case does not mean that BearingPoint is required to provide Mr Hillard with work. Rather, I consider that it is simply a repetitive indication that the payment in lieu can be made for part of the notice period after some other part has been served or worked by the employee. Whilst Mr Hillard is on garden leave he is "working" in the sense that he is performing what he has been directed by his employer to do in order to be paid.</sentence>

 39. In the recent decision of AMP Services v Manning [2006] FCA 256 the Federal Court considered whether Jones v Dunkel was available when a witness was available to both parties. In this case the plaintiffs, members of the AMP Group, sought to recover losses through amongst other things a claim for breach of contract, relying on a post-employment restraint of trade and confidentiality clause. Finkelstein J, in a passage partially quoted by the husband in his submissions, said at par 48 and 49: 
 
 
 [48] If it were possible, I would have called the clients myself in order to get to the truth of the matter. 
 40. Thus if it is determined that the witness were equally available to both parties, an inference would be available against each of them "the particular strength of the inference depending on the circumstances": AMP Services v Manning [2006] FCA 256 at [49] citing Wigmore on Evidence.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] FCA 1685">110 Both parties submitted that the other should have called Mr Koeppen, and that the failure to do so enlivened the principle in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298. That is, each submitted that the unexplained failure of the other to call Mr Koeppen would sustain an inference that his evidence would not have assisted the other's case. The legal principle is also that the failure enables available inferences to be drawn more confidently. Neither SEA nor CPI sought to explain by evidence why they had not called Mr Koeppen (see West v Government Insurance Office of NSW [1981] HCA 38 ; (1981) 148 CLR 62 at 70), although counsel for SEA did elicit from Mr Cassell that Mr Koeppen had been in Australia shortly before the trial and he had been in contact with him. It seems to me that either party could have called Mr Koeppen, although there may have been problems about requiring his attendance if he had not been willing to give evidence. He is, in a sense, in both SEA's and CPI's camp (to use the term often used in this area of legal discourse) and would have been equally available to both. He has an ongoing commercial relationship, on behalf of the Mill, with CPI. SEO also has an interest in the Mill. There is a division of judicial opinion whether, in circumstances where a witness is equally available to both parties, the principle operates to enable inferences to be drawn against both: see the discussion in AMP Services Ltd v Manning [2006] FCA 256 at [49] and also Built Interiors Pty Ltd v Three Dinosaurs Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 290 at [49] .</sentence>
