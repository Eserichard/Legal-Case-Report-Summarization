<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] VSCA 234">18 His Honour then referred to the solicitor's affidavit and in the course of doing so to the decision of Gordon J in AWB Ltd v ASIC [1] and to those parts of the judgment of Gordon J in which she summarised the steps taken by ASIC to protect AWB's LPP in the course of its investigation (without permitting AWB itself to be represented at any examination and without making any provision for such protection in the case of witness statements supplied voluntarily).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] VSC 330">7 In two other proceedings in which ASIC has been involved, relating to AWB's wheat sales to Iraq and the UN Food-for-Oil Program, AWB has taken steps seeking to ensure that confidentiality is maintained with respect to any LPP communications of AWB that are contained in statements and transcripts concerning the relevant individuals, where the statements and transcripts are to be disclosed or produced by ASIC. In AWB Limited v ASIC [1] , heard by Gordon J in the Federal Court of Australia, AWB challenged a decision by ASIC to disclose to the Australian Federal Police, under s 127 of the ASIC Act, statements and transcripts in relation to relevant individuals. AWB contended that ASIC did not, in making its decision, give consideration to whether the statements and transcripts to be disclosed to the AFP contained AWB's LPP communications. Gordon J dismissed AWB's application. AWB has appealed against the decision of Gordon J. The appeal was heard on 18 February 2009 and judgment was reserved. 9 In AWB Limited v ASIC, [3] Gordon J sets out the steps taken by AWB to protect its LPP at the examination of its employees and former employees by ASIC. I will not repeat what she said but I nevertheless rely on paragraphs [9]-[12]. In substance, AWB sought to attend the examinations to protect its LPP and counsel for AWB made submissions to the ASIC investigator, seeking to ensure that its LPP was protected.</sentence>
