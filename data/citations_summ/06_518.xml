<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 137">37 This leaves the question of contempt by failing to comply with para 1 of the order of 10 June 2005. It should be noted that the statement of charge in the notice of motion alleges contempt against both respondents, but only in one respect. There is no charge of disposing of, transferring or dealing with the Mariners Place property without first giving notice in writing to the applicant no less than 14 days prior to such dealing. There is no charge of failing to sell the property by public auction. The only charge is failing to pay the proceeds of sale (after deduction of the reasonable costs and expenses of sale) into the trust account kept by Kelly &amp; Chapman. In the absence of a specification in para 1 of the order of 10 June 2005 of the time within which such a payment was required, Ms Bell was obliged to pay the proceeds of the sale into the trust account within a reasonable time of receiving them. See Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 1) [2006] FCA 518 at [13] and [41] --- [42]. In any event, the time may not be crucial because, at least by June 2006, when Ms Bell returned from her second trip to Tunisia, she had clearly disposed of all of the proceeds of sale otherwise than by paying them into the trust account, and thereby put it out of her power to comply with the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1199">In these proceedings I found the applicant has satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent was guilty on four charges of contempt in my judgment in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 1) [2006] FCA 518. Today I have heard evidence from the respondent both on affidavit and in the witness box relating to the circumstances in which the contempts occurred and his current attitude in relation to the subject matter of those charges.  I do not accept any explanation that the respondent has sought to give of that behaviour. In the witness-box today he asserted that he had put the meta tag there knowing, as he said, that it would not be visible to the ordinary viewer of the webpage but that it might be seen in some web browsers. The reason he gave for putting the disclaimer in a meta tag, was that he thought that that was above the fold referred to in the order. For the reasons that I gave in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 1) [2006] FCA 518 , the use of the words 'above the fold' makes no difference to the proper construction of the orders or the flagrancy of the evasion which the use of the meta tag involved.  In my opinion, this breach was quite flagrant, as I described in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No1) [2006] FCA 518. It was a deliberate attempt to evade the very clear order requiring an active communication by the respondent of the dissociation of his business from the applicant's. The use of the meta tag was calculated to avoid giving effect at all to the order. It was an attempt to disguise the very thing the order required be revealed: namely, the dissociation of the businesses.  Charge 11 involved the use of the HTML meta tag which I described in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 1) [2006] FCA 518 at [41] - [47]. That conduct was engaged in between at least 1 March 2006, as I found ([2006] FCA 518 at [47]), and at least no later than 24 April 2006, which is the date Ms Than refers to in par 5 of her affidavit of 15 May 2006 as the date on which the disclaimer was noted by her to appear.  Charge 11 involved the use of the HTML meta tag which I described in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 1) [2006] FCA 518 at [41] - [47]. That conduct was engaged in between at least 1 March 2006, as I found ([2006] FCA 518 at [47]), and at least no later than 24 April 2006, which is the date Ms Than refers to in par 5 of her affidavit of 15 May 2006 as the date on which the disclaimer was noted by her to appear.  The question then arises as to what fine I ought impose on each of the counts that I have found proved and for which I have convicted the respondent. Charge 6 involved the use of the business name Simply Natural Floorcoverings with 'floorcoverings' as one word on the web site for a period that commenced at least on 19 January 2006 and continued at least to 2 March 2006, as I found in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 1) [2006] FCA 518 at [37] and [38]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 602">8 That animation was described in my earlier judgment, Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 1) [2006] FCA 518 at [6] - [8] and [30]-[32]. However, it seems to me that there is a slight difference between the evidence on the previous occasion and that today in that what I recorded in [2006] FCA 518 at [31] as an observation about the form of the evidence on that occasion suggested that the spiral or roll design itself appeared initially on the screen, whereas in fact, the evidence today satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that what initially appeared on the screen to the left-hand side during the period between 16 February 2006 and 20 March 2006 was a line that then rolled into the carpet roll or spiral shape, and then unravelled as it passed across to the right-hand side of the screen. In screen grab number 1 that Mr Dowe took, the spiral shape distinctly appears close to but distinctly to the left-hand side of the computer screen.  8 That animation was described in my earlier judgment, Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 1) [2006] FCA 518 at [6] - [8] and [30]-[32].

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 519">1 When I was delivering my judgment ex tempore in this matter on 12 April 2006, it occurred to me for the reasons I then gave ( Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 1) [2006] FCA 518 at [34] - [35] ('the first judgment') that charge 2 was bad for duplicity: Johnson v Miller [1937] HCA 77 ; (1937) 59 CLR 467. Then Dixon J said (59 CLR at 489-490):
 
 'For, in many cases, evidence of more than one offence cannot be admitted, and under one charge to take evidence of a number of separate instances of the commission of the same offence because each will indifferently fit the complaint is to pursue a course contrary to law. It cannot be enough to require the complainant to elect among the instances he has proved after his evidence has been given in full.</sentence>
