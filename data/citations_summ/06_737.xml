<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1905">107 Each of Telstra and the Commission submit that its form of declaration encapsulates the result in Telstra No 2 . It is of interest that, in written submissions and correctly, Telstra characterises that result as a decision ' that the Competition Notice was invalid '. The issues that fell for consideration concerned the Competition Notice and the Consultation Notice, not the reasoning behind the issue of those notices. Telstra's claims turned upon the construction of the Competition Notice and the Consultation Notice, a comparison between them and a evaluation of the requirements of s 151AKA(2) of the Act. Telstra did not allege that the Commission had no reason to believe that Telstra had engaged or was engaging in the relevant anti-competitive conduct or that the notices were issued for a collateral or improper purpose. There was no consideration of the decision-making process of the Commission ( Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCA 737 ; (2006) 68 IPR 571). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 493">If the Commission based its decision to issue the Competition Notice on some particular issue or material adverse to Telstra that was not apparent from the Consultation Notice, procedural fairness would require that some step additional to the issue of the Consultation Notice be taken ( Alphaone at 591-2). Telstra was entitled to be given notice of that material or the substance of it. The Commission accepts that, if it was obliged to provide that material to Telstra which it denies, Telstra was not accorded procedural fairness ( Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCA 737 ; (2006) 68 IPR 571 at [30] ). Failure to provide such information was a denial of procedural fairness or natural justice. Disputed issues as to procedural fairness 
 
203 As developed during submissions, the dispute between the parties on procedural fairness related to three issues:
 
 (i) whether the general duty of procedural fairness takes its content only from s 151AKA(10) --- as the Commission but not Optus submits;
 (ii) whether any duty broader than s 151AKA(10) has been breached; and
 (iii) whether there was a denial of procedural fairness by reason of the uncertainty or lack of clarity of the Consultation Notice or the Competition Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1001">Unless there is some further reason why the applicants should provide discovery of those documents, it is unnecessary to make an order requiring them to do so (note recent similar comments of Bennett J in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2006] FCA 737 at par 31). </sentence>
