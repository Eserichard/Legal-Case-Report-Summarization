<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 65">68 In our view, the trial judge failed to adequately address that the conduct he identified as having "positive aspects" and which he considered "could well be regarded as consonant with the main objects of the BCII Act", was in fact unlawful conduct under that Act: see ss 38 and 44(1) of the BCII Act. The conduct was unlawful because the respondents adopted means which were not consistent with the objects of the BCII Act, namely seeking to place undue pressure on Celltech to make an EBA. As Besanko J said in Bonan v Hadgkiss [2006] FCA 1334 ; (2006) 160 FCR 10 at [31] , [34] and [37] in relation to the BCII Act, the intention of Parliament is to be discerned from the provisions of the Act. In the present case, it appears that the trial judge considered some, but not all, of the provisions of the BCII Act or at the very least failed to adequately address those provisions of the Act which prescribed unlawful conduct, even if that conduct sought to achieve some stated object of the Act. As a result, the sentencing discretion miscarried.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 150">The ABCC Hearing was an examination under s.52(1)(e) of the BCI Act , conducted on 30 October 2008, that is, a little over six weeks after the alleged events of 12 September 2008. A copy of the ABCC Hearing Transcript was produced to the Court for the purposes of arguing the application. The Federal Court has held, in Bonan v Hadgkiss , [13] that the relevant ABCC Commissioner or delegate, who is conducting those proceedings has power in an ABCC Hearing to make directions with respect to the integrity of the evidence in those hearings, and to regulate and control the conduct of proceedings in such a hearing. It is apparent from the judgment in Bonan that the Federal Court came to the view that that was a power which was implied and not express. In this case, there was a non-disclosure order --- obviously, in the circumstances, exercised pursuant to the implied power --- and that non-disclosure order was withdrawn on 16 September 2009.</sentence>
