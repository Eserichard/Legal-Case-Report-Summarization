<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1054">The Court's discretion to confirm a scheme is not at large. It is to be exercised on the evidence, having regard to the objects of the Act, principally the protection of the interests of policyholders and prospective policyholders. This was explained by Gyles J in Re MetLife Insurance Limited [2007] FCA 1327 ; (2007) 63 ACSR 492 at [28] . There are other authorities to the same effect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 669">Also, a similar approach is taken in the authorities which deal with schemes under the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth); see for example Re MetLife Insurance Limited [2007] FCA 1327 ; (2007) 63 ACSR 492 at [28] per Gyles J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 637">The principles which govern the exercise of the Court's discretion to confirm the scheme are well established. In Re Metlife Insurance Ltd [2007] FCA 1327 ; [2007] FCA 1327 ; (2007) 63 ACSR 492 at [28] Gyles J observed that the discretion to confirm the scheme pursuant to section 194 is at large and is only confined by the purposes to be served by it in the context of the Act as a whole and in Part 9 in particular. His Honour pointed out that the role of the Court is plainly not limited to supervising the various procedural steps to be taken, nor by any opinion that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ("APRA") expresses. However, an important indication of the proper approach is the first object of the Act stated in section 3(1). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1239">34 I also took into account the fact that APRA was represented before me and that it has expressed no objection to the Scheme. As Sheppard J said in The Application of Advance Insurance Ltd (unreported, Sheppard J, 18 February 1997) at 16---18, the Court relies on persons in the position now occupied by APRA, to place any evidence, including actuarial evidence, before the Court if it chose to do so. This is not to suggest that the Court abdicates the decision to APRA (cf, in a similar context, Re Metlife Insurance Ltd (2007) 63 ACSR 492 , [2007] FCA 1327 at [28] , [30] and [37]). </sentence>
