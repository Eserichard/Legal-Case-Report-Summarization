<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 270">146 In Bella Products Pty Ltd v Creative Designs International Ltd [2009] FCA 868 ; (2009) 258 ALR 538 at 543 [22] Finkelstein J said the following: 
 

 
 
 21. In TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 194 ; (2008) 172 FCR 433 , both at trial and on appeal, the Federal Court applied the Voth and Oceanic Sun Liner test in respect of an application for a temporary stay of an action pending in an Australian court when there was a similar action pending in a United States court. Regrettably (all the more so because I was on the appellate bench) that approach was wrong.</sentence>
