<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 851">Expressed in perhaps slightly different language, in Sochorova v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 555 , Spender J set forth the terms of O 52 r 5(3) and expressed " the relevant test " as follows: 
 THE RELEVANT TEST
 ... 

 
 [38] The discretion to extend time conferred by that rule is given for the sole purpose of enabling justice to be done between the parties. 

 
 [39] In Gallo v Dawson [1990] HCA 30 ; (1990) 93 ALR 479 , McHugh J was concerned with the application of O 60 r 6 of the High Court Rules in respect of the applicant's application for an extension of time. McHugh J said, at 480: 

 
[Order 60 rule 6] provides that a court or a justice may enlarge the time appointed by the Rules for doing an act upon such terms, if any, as the justice of the case may require and that the enlargement may be ordered although the application is not made until after the expiration of the time appointed or fixed for doing the act.</sentence>
