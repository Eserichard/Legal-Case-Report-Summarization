<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 537">A recent decision of Siopis J in NBKE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 126 illustrates that a Tribunal will make a jurisdictional error, if it treats a passport as conclusive of the issue of nationality, and for that reason does not address a claim that a passport does not evidence true nationality.</sentence>
