<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1225">It follows from the above that a requirement that employees repay the cost of the repair associated with negligent damage to a vehicle was not a condition of employment of Mr Lee at the time of the accident. The Handbook indicated that K&amp;S might introduce new policies or vary, change or alter its existing policies, and this is not an unusual provision (see McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1903 ; (2007) 168 IR 375 at [66] ). However, since no notice was given prior to the accident of the fundamental change in both the policy and its application, K&amp;S had no contractual basis for relying upon it to justify the termination of Mr Lee. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] SASC 272">The Full Court [173] provided a helpful survey of the current position of the implied term in Australia. Their Honours set out the decisions in which Australian Courts have suggested that such a term exists [174] and those which have not. [175] Their Honours also indicated that the High Court appears to have endorsed the concept on a few occasions. Specifically, the Full Court reproduced a quote from Koehler v Cerebros (Australia) Limited , [176] where the majority (McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ) said, in the context of a suit in negligence, that: [177] 
 
 it is only when the contractual position between the parties (including the implied duty of trust and confidence between them) 'is explored fully along with the relevant statutory framework' that it would be possible to give appropriate content to the duty of reasonable care upon which an employee claiming damages for negligent infliction of psychiatric injury at work would seek to rely. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] VSC 196">215 The question as to whether, in a contract of employment, there is to be implied an obligation of good faith, and, if so, the impact of that obligation on the parties' rights to terminate such a contract, has been the subject of much discussion in the cases. There is authority for the proposition that such an obligation may be implicit in a contract of employment. [57] I note however that there are some cases, in which the view had been expressed, albeit obiter dictum, that no such obligation may be implied in a contract of employment. [58] Further, it has been held that any such obligation would not be implied, so as to affect a right of termination of a contract expressly provided by the contract itself or under statute. [59] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] NSWDC 396">42. I am not persuaded the authorities concerning obligations of good faith assist in the resolution of this dispute. In single judgments of the Federal Court of Australia it has been doubted that a term requiring mutual trust and confidence could be implied in employment contracts: McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1903 ; (2007) 168 I.R. 375 at (398-400), per Buchanan J; Walker v Citigroup Global Markets Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1678 ; (2005) 226 ALR 114 at 156-157 (Kenny J) (the appeal, at [2006] FCAFC 101 ; (2006) 233 ALR 687 at [86] did not consider the point); and Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Ltd [2009] FCA 597 at [85] (Tracey J). On the other hand, as I have noted, the Court of Appeal, (by way of obiter), put forward the contrary position in C.G.U. Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd . Here I see resolution of the case arising from construing the written contract: no implied terms of trust and confidence are necessary in its construction. Nor were any pleaded.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 964">Mr Britt submits that the terms of the Workplace Change document and the agreement were not provided to Mr Roberts at the time he commenced employment but only came into being more than five years after his commencement date: Nikolich v Goldman Sachs JBWere Services Pty Ltd (supra) at [247]. The language and contents of the Agreement and the Workplace Change document do not speak of a contractual purpose and Mr Roberts was not required to sign either document: Goldman Sachs JB Were Services Pty Ltd v Nikolich at [21] per Black CJ. They were not matters to which Mr Roberts was committing himself at the time of employment and the circumstances suggest that they were not incorporated: McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) [2007] FCA 1903 at [67] . Mr Roberts' employment contract contains a mechanism for variation which is not met. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] WAIRComm 580">In McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1903 ; (2007) 168 IR 375 Buchanan J dealt with this issue, again in the context of a claim for damages for a breach of such a term pleaded as being implied into the applicant's contract of employment in that case. After considering some of the Australian authorities dealing with the issue, most recently Russell , his Honour observed at pars 90-93 as follows: 
"90 The tests for the implication of a term into a contract are usually accepted to be those stated in B.P. Refinery (Westernport) Pty Limited v Hastings Shire Council [1977] HCA 40 ; (1977) 180 CLR 266 at 283 --- namely that:
 
 '... for a term to be implied, the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied: (1) it must be reasonable and equitable; (2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it; (3) it must be so obvious that "it goes without saying"; (4) it must be capable of clear expression; (5) it must not contradict any express term of the contract. ' 
 
(See also Codelfa Construction Proprietary Limited v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 347.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] SASC 219">So far as we can ascertain, the only decisions in Australia which have doubted the implication of the term of mutual trust and confidence are in Heptonstall v Gaskin (No. 2) [50] (Hoeben J); McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Limited [51] (Buchanan J) and Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Limited [52] (Tracey J).

 Introduction 
 This is an appeal against an award of damages to a former teacher for breach of his employment contract. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 656">Counsel for Ms Yousif also contended that there was a term implied by law that the Bank would act in good faith. An authority cited in support of the implication of such a term was the judgment of Rothman J in Russell v Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney [2007] NSWSC 104 ; (2007) 69 NSWLR 198. However, there is a preponderance of authority against the implication of such a term: Aldersea v Public Transport Corporation [2001] VSC 169 ; (2001) 3 VR 499 ; Walker v Citigroup Global Markets Pty Ltd (2005) 226 ALR 114 ; [2005] FCA 1678 ; McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 168 IR 375; [2007] FCA 1903. Was there a breach of the implied terms? </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 597">CMA's argument on damages seemed to proceed on the assumption that compensatory damages were not available. It resisted the "loss of chance" claim on the basis that Mr Van Efferen did not have a contract for a specific term and that no question of the possibility of renewal of the contract arose: see McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1903 ; (2007) 168 IR 375 at 397-8. In this context it relied on the arguments, outlined above at [52] which, it contended, supported the view that there was no causal nexus between any contravention of clause 2.10 and the damage alleged by Mr Van Efferen.  More recently, in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1903 ; (2007) 168 IR 375 Buchanan J cautioned that the award of damages for "loss of a chance" could not occur, consistently with Amann Aviation , in the absence of a fixed term contract and evidence supporting the possibility that the contract might be renewed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] NSWDC 43">18 In McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1903 ; (2007) 168 IR 375 , Buchanan J, in the Federal Court, made some useful comments. At [46] he said: 
 

 
 "The next questions are whether it was serious misconduct or wilful misconduct. There is doubtless substantial overlap between these two descriptions. Wilful misconduct will more readily be regarded as serious than unintentional or merely careless misconduct. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 1191">In McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) [2007] FCA 1903 (" McDonald ") Buchanan J in dealing with a claim by a former employee of unlawful discrimination on the grounds of family responsibilities considered the cases examining 'misconduct' 'serious misconduct' and 'serious and wilful misconduct' beginning at paragraph 48 of His Honour's decision. "48. The terms 'misconduct', 'serious misconduct' and 'serious and wilful misconduct' are often the subject of judicial and administrative attention as applied to the facts of particular cases but there is relatively little judicial discussion about their content and meaning. Naturally enough, when the term 'serious misconduct' is under consideration an evaluation of what conduct represents 'serious' misconduct is influenced by the (usually statutory) setting in which the phrase must be given meaning and applied. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] SAWCT 37">In Rankin v Marine Power International the learned Judge went on to list misconduct, disobedience, incompetence or negligence as acts or omissions of an employee which depending on the gravity, may constitute a sufficient breach for summary dismissal. [18] In this respect it is said that misconduct will more readily be regarded as serious than carelessness or incompetence. [19] Nonetheless it is important to acknowledge as it permits summary dismissal at common law in cases of incompetence as opposed to misbehaviour. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 571">As in McDonald it has not been established here that the policies had "any contractual force and effect. " The terms of the Agreement refer to the applicants' "participation" in a performance related incentive plan and indicated the criteria would be advised in due course. [51] Be that as it may and mindful of the respondent's submission that if the applicant had a right it was a right to participate in the bonus scheme, it is necessary to consider what is the impact of this on the applicant's claim.  In McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) [2007] FCA 1903 (" McDonald ") Buchanan J considered an argument whether staff guidelines had been incorporated into the contract of employment of the applicant in that case. At [66] His Honour said: "66. It is true that the Staff Guidelines are referred to as being ones which 'govern' her employment and the letter of offer reminds her that she agrees to be bound by the policies of the company as set out in the Staff Guidelines and elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCA 2086">1 On 7 December 2007 I dismissed all the applicant's claims ( McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) [2007] FCA 1903). I did not then deal with the question of costs. The respondents have now made an application for costs, including indemnity costs, in the amount of $203,909.89.</sentence>
