<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1169">In Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Cooper [2005] FCA 972 ; (2005) 150 FCR 1 at 30, Tamberlin J observed by reference to these and other authorities, that in order to make out a case of joint tortfeasor liability on the basis that copyright infringement is a statutory tort, it is necessary to establish that there has been a common design by the respondents to participate in or induce or procure another person to commit an act of infringement. His Honour emphasised that in circumstances where two or more persons assisted or concurred in or contributed to an act causing damage this is not of itself sufficient to found joint liability and there must also be some common design. In other words, there must be something in the nature of concerted action or agreed common action. It is not necessary that there must be an explicitly mapped out plan with the primary offenders. Tacit agreement between the parties is sufficient. In Foxtel Management Pty Ltd v Mod Shop Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 463 ; [2007] FCA 463 ; (2007) 165 FCR 149 , at [133], Siopis J adopted his Honour's analysis. I too agree with it. The parties here do not contest otherwise. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 590">In coming to my conclusion as to the quantum of additional damages I was reminded by the applicant that in APRA v Cougars Tavern &amp; Ors [2008] FMCA 369 I took into account the views expressed in a number of past cases. [8] He then helpfully referred to some cases not mentioned there and others of a more recent vintage. [9] The respondent submitted that the pecuniary damages in TS &amp; B Retail (supra) were calculated by reference to a sample and suggested that the amount of additional damages took into account the possibility that the pecuniary damages did not really reflect the extent of the infringement whereas in the instant case the exact extent of the infringement was known by virtue of the evidence of Ms Tang. The respondent noted that the Elwood Clothing Pty Ltd v Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 633 ; (2009) 81 IPR 378 case was a counterfeiting operation and that in Rutter v Brooklyn Valley Estate Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 702 ; (2009) 81 IPR 549 there was a long-term series of infringement from 1999 onwards until judgment. The Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1495 ; (2009) 84 IPR 222 decision was also one involving a long-term full scale counterfeiting operation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 433">The applicants sought an award of additional damages in the sum of $100,000. In their outline of submissions the applicants have referred to cases where additional damages have been awarded in the range of $3million to $50,000. I find an award of $50,000 will serve as a specific deterrent on the respondent as well as a general deterrent to those in their industry who may be tempted. (See Amalgamated Mining Service Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd [1992] FCA 542 ; (1992) 24 IPR 461 , Bailey v Namol [1994] FCA 1401 ; (1994) 30 IPR 147 , Milpurrurru and Others v Indofurn Pty Ltd and Others (1994) 30 IPR 209 , Microsoft v Goodview (2000) 49 IPR 578 , Microsoft Corporation and Others v PC Club Australia Pty Ltd and Others [2005] FCA 1522 ; (2005) 67 IPR 262 , Fraserside Holdings &amp; Anor v Venus Adult Shops &amp; Ors [2005] FMCA 997 , Foxtel Management Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Mod Shop Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 463 ; (2007) 72 IPR 1 , Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd (in Liquidation) &amp; Ors [2007] FCAFC 40 ; (2007) 71 IPR 437 , Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 , Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd and Anor [2008] FCA 74 , Elwood Clothing Pty Ltd v Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 633) and G-Star Raw Denim KFT &amp; Anor v Urban Culture Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 1317). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1495">Siopis J cited the relevant passage from the decision of Tamberlin J with apparent approval in Foxtel Management Pty Ltd v The Mod Shop Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 463 ; (2008) 165 FCR 149 at [133] .

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 1317">The applicants sought an award of $100,000 under this head. In support of that award the applicants referred to various cases where awards under this head were made in the range of $3 million against a corporation to $30,000 against a director of such. In my view, proportionality dictates that against these respondents, an award of $50,000 will serve as a specific deterrent to them, and a general deterrent to those in their industry who may be tempted. (See Amalgamated Mining Service Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd [1992] FCA 542 ; [1992] FCA 542 ; (1992) 24 IPR 461 , Bailey v Namol [1994] FCA 1401 ; (1994) 30 IPR 147 , Milpurrurru and Others v Indofurn Pty Ltd and Others (1994) 30 IPR 209 , Microsoft v Goodview (2000) 49 IPR 578 , Microsoft Corporation and Others v PC Club Australia Pty Ltd and Others [2005] FCA 1522 ; (2005) 67 IPR 262 , Fraserside Holdings &amp; Anor v Venus Adult Shops &amp; Ors [2005] FMCA 997 , Foxtel Management Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Mod Shop Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 463 ; (2007) 72 IPR 1 , Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd (in Liquidation) &amp; Ors [2007] FCAFC 40 ; (2007) 71 IPR 437 and Elwood Clothing Pty Ltd v Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 633) Question of Declarations and Injunctions

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 1298">Counsel for Deckers invites a comparison of the circumstances of the present case with a large number of other cases in which both compensatory and additional damages have been awarded for copyright infringement. Attention was also directed to the quantum of the damages awarded in those cases. They include Aristocrat Technologies , Microsoft Corporation v Glostar Pty Ltd (t/as Downtown Technology Centre) [2003] FCA 210 ; (2003) 57 IPR 518 ; Vivid Entertainment LLC v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FMCA 748 ; Microsoft Corporation v Ezy Loans Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1135 ; (2004) 63 IPR 54 ; Microsoft Corporation v Goodview Electronics Pty Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 578 ; Zero Tolerance Entertainment Inc v Venus Adult Shops Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 155 ; Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 64 IPR 18 ; Bailey v Namol Pty Limited [1994] FCA 1401 ; (1994) 53 FCR 102 ; Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd [1992] FCA 542 ; (1992) 24 IPR 461 ; Foxtel Management Pty Ltd v Mod Shop Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 463 ; (2007) 72 IPR 1 ; Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Monster Communications Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1806 ; (2006) 71 IPR 212 ; and Elwood Clothing Pty Ltd (ACN 079 393 696) v Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd (ACN 052 130 462) (2009) 8 IPR 378. These authorities are of limited assistance. They emphasise the unfettered nature of the discretion conferred on the Court in fixing an appropriate measure of additional damages. They demonstrate that, depending on the circumstances of the case, a significant award of additional damages can be made even though compensatory damages are fixed at a nominal sum; and that additional damages are often fixed at a lower sum than that awarded for compensatory damages. They make it plain that there is no recognised practice of awarding additional damages in an amount equal to or lower than compensatory damages: cf Raben Footwear at 104 (per Tamberlin J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 369">PPCA v Adelaide City Entertainment [2005] FMCA 923 this court awarded additional damages of $85,000.00. SBO Pictures Inc v Kaos Shop Pty Ltd [2006] FMCA 82 , the court awarded compensatory damages of $3,500 and additional damages of $46,500. Foxtel Management Pty Limited v The Mod Shop Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 463 , the Court awarded additional damages of $300,000 against one director and $60,000 against another. Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Limited v D.A.P. Services (Kempsey) Pty Limited (In Liquidation) [2007] FCAFC 40 , the Full Court awarded additional damages of $200,000 with nominal compensatory damages of $1.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] VCAT 403">Mr Forrest submitted that I should apply the "direct or procure test" to found liability in Ktori. He relied upon Foxtel management Pty Ltd v The Mod Shop Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 463 , a case of copyright infringement, and Coastal Recycled Cooking Oils Pty Ltd v Innovative Business Action and Strategies Pty Ltd [2007] NSWC 831, a case of conversion. The "direct or procure test" is not of any assistance in this case because it is a claim in negligence, a very different kind of tort, and the authorities referred to have used a different approach in such cases. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCAFC 11">1 The appellant, along with others, was found to have been involved in the commission of flagrant breaches of Pt VAA of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) by unauthorised use of Foxtel smartcards: Foxtel Management Pty Limited v The Mod Shop Pty Limited [2007] FCA 463. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FMCA 155">In that case the fact that Mr Lee had previously been involved in copyright infringement through an unrelated corporate entity was held by his Honour to be a relevant factor in assessing additional damages: 
 
 
 
 It must therefore follow that in relation to PC Club, and also to Mr Lee personally as PC Club's controlling mind at all material times, the applicants have established a persuasive case for an award of additional damages referable to s 115(4) factors, in particular based upon the flagrancy of infringement and the need to deter similar infringements, and upon the benefits inherently accrued from the infringements, at least of a pecuniary nature. It was not a case only of flagrancy of conduct on the part of PC Club and Mr Lee, but also a case of history of engagement in infringing conduct by the predecessor corporate vehicle controlled by Mr Lee. " [106] 
 
 
 
 &#8226; In Foxtel Management Pty Limited v The Mod Shop Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 463 , the Court awarded additional damages of $300,000 against one director and $60,000 against another. In differentiating the two awards, the Court noted that the latter director's involvement had been limited by time, that he and his wife held less than a 10% interest in the Mod Shop companies and had received no dividends from their shareholding. [107] The compensatory damages awarded in that case were $653,000.</sentence>
