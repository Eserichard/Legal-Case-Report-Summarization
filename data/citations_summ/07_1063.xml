<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 198">The decision in Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [23] concerned payment for services yet to be rendered;
 
(c) a payment made in substitution for another payment entitlement takes the character of the original entitlement; [24] 
 
(d) the money value of a non-cash receipt is the relevant taxable amount; [25] 
 
(e) an amount can be derived as income even if not paid to or received by the taxpayer. Common law concepts of constructive receipt and the statutory formulations of those concepts have a role to play in such cases. [26]
