<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1787">56 Under Pt 3-90 of the 1997 Act, the consolidated group is treated as a single taxpayer represented by the head company. The assets of a subsidiary member are treated as being held by the head company. As already noted, the head company inherits the tax history of the subsidiary member when it joins the group. Plainly enough, the regime established by Pt 3-90 is intended to reflect, within the tax framework, the commercial and economic realities of corporate group dealings: compare s 700-10. See generally Envestra Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 249 at [6] - [9] per Mansfield J. As his Honour commented in Envestra at [6], "[t]hat process obviously required rules, including to set the cost for income tax purposes of the assets that a subsidiary member would bring into the group". Just as rules are needed for this purpose, so too rules are needed to govern the situation when a subsidiary member leaves the group. A subsidiary member leaves the group when it ceases to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the head company.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 444">3 Effective 1 July 2002, Australia introduced a consolidation regime to allow a wholly owned group of resident entities to consolidate their tax position rather than be treated as separate entities. The consolidation regime is principally contained in Pt 3 - 90 of the ITAA 97, comprising Divs 700 to 721. The only judicial consideration of these provisions of which I am aware is the very recent decision of Mansfield J in Envestra Limited (ACN 078 551 685) v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 249 (unreported) on 7 March 2008 that concerned a discrete aspect of the tax cost setting rules and has no connection with the issues in the present case. By the time of the introduction of the consolidation regime, the measures quarantining the franking surpluses of a corporate tax entity on it ceasing to be an exempting entity and becoming a former exempting entity were embodied in Div 208 of Pt 3 - 6 of the ITAA 97. Subdivision 709-B of Pt 3 - 90 of the ITAA 97 modifies the operation of Div 208 in relation to consolidated groups in a number of different ways, depending on the status of the head company and its subsidiary member at the joining time.</sentence>
