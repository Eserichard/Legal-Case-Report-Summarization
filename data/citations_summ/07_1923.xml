<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 41">Instead, the learned Federal Magistrate reasoned this way: 
 In my opinion, SCAR stands as binding authority for an underlying principle going beyond the issue of fitness to "represent himself before the Tribunal" on the day of a hearing, which was raised by the facts of that case (see [13]-[16] and [40]-[41]). The broader foundation of the Full Court's decision is pointed to by the analogous circumstances that their Honours identify in [37] above. These include categories of jurisdictional error where a substantial error of translation has prevented the applicant meaningfully communicating his evidence to the Tribunal, where it assessed his evidence upon false assumption as to his evidence, and where this materially affected the outcome (see authorities such as Perera v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 507 ; (1999) 92 FCR 6 , VWFY v Minster for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1723 , M175 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1212 , SZGYM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1923 , and SZJBD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 106 at [73]). Plainly, such a jurisdictional error affecting a hearing of a Tribunal does not usually, if ever, have the drastic and irremediable effects which concerned Branson J. The important consideration of fairness, which in my opinion the Full Court's judgment in SCAR points to, is that a significant impairment to communication at a hearing arising from language or mental state should be taken into account by the Tribunal when assessing the person's evidence, and that the Tribunal should not make its decision based upon a false assumption that the impairment did not exist.</sentence>

If the Tribunal does make a decision upon a false assumption as to the opportunity enjoyed by the applicant at the hearing under s.425 , and if this has materially affected the Tribunal's conclusions, the Tribunal has failed to exercise its jurisdiction according to law. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 972">The complaints about interpretation may also be particulars of the breach of natural justice claim by the applicant. Whilst I accept that there are circumstances in which a failure to interpret would mean that the applicant was not provided with a proper hearing pursuant to s.425 of the Migration Act 1958 (the "Act") this is not one of those cases because the applicant has not provided appropriate evidence. And insofar as natural justice is concerned the applicant is subject to the provisions of s.422B of the Act and has not provided the court with any particulars of a breach of the Division. Insofar as the interpretation complaints are concerned I would note that SZGYM v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1923 is authority for the argument that inadequate interpretation can amount to breach of s.425 but that SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 per Middleton J at [21] makes it clear that the applicant has to establish by probative evidence that: "(a) The standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was so inadequate that the appellants were effectively prevented from giving evidence at the hearing; or (b) Errors made by the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing were material to the conclusions of the Tribunal adverse to the appellants. " 
Finally, the full bench in WACO v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 171 indicated that a perfect translation was not necessary. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 813">This is not a case in which it has been established that the provision of a Farsi interpreter (rather than, for example, an Azari Turkish speaker) meant that the applicant was unable to give evidence and present arguments in the manner considered in SZGYM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1923 (and see also SZLMN &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 582). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 582">While this ground is expressed in terms of procedural fairness, in submissions the applicant placed reliance on s.425 of the Migration Act which requires the Tribunal to invite the applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. It was contended that the requisite " meaningful opportunity " to appear to give evidence and present arguments under s.425 (see Allsop J in SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 at [53] and SZGYM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1923 at [27] per Graham J) had not been provided. In light of s.422B of the Act and the manner in which this ground was argued I have considered whether there was a failure to comply with s.425 of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 432">It is not shown that there was any inability by the applicant and the interpreter to understand each other, or that the interpretation failed in any respect --- much less in a material way that could amount to jurisdictional error. Whilst there is no transcript in evidence, the record of the hearing contained within the Tribunal's reasons, which need not be complete, does in this case give a lengthy and apparently detailed account of evidence without any suggestion that there was an interpretation failure. For the above reasons, the present case is distinguishable from SZGYM v MIAC [2007] FCA 1923 , for example, where Graham J, on the evidence before him, found jurisdictional error insofar as differences in dialect had led to the applicant and the interpreter not understanding each other. Also, it appears from [81] that, at the end of the hearing, the Tribunal asked the applicant if he had anything else to say and there is no indication that he sought to then say anything further. One would expect that he would have said something at that point if any dialectical difference had been such that he felt he had not communicated all that he wished.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 341">As discussed above, at no time did the applicant or his adviser ask the Tribunal (or the Department) to provide an Uzbek interpreter (cf SZGYM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1923). On all the Departmental and Tribunal forms before the Court the applicant requested a Russian interpreter. He requested an interpreter in Russian for the Tribunal hearing. His adviser indicated, some way into the hearing, that the applicant's Russian was " not good at all " (and the interpreter agreed) and that he might not understand " well-phrased questions " ... "[b] eing pressed and being confused between a few languages " (transcript p.13). This comment (and the interpreter's later remark about his Russian being " very primitive ") was not made in the context of suggesting that the applicant should have been provided with an interpreter in a different language (whether that be Tajik, Uzbek or even Korean). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 180">If the applicant is making a complaint about the quality of the translation which would constitute a claim that s.425 of the Act has not been complied with, he would have to do more than to make a bold assertion at the hearing. While the Court accepts that inadequate interpretation can amount to a breach of s.425: SZGYM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 1923 , there is a strong obligation upon the applicant to establish inadequate interpretation: SZJZE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 1653 where his Honour, Middleton J said at [21]: "With respect to the first ground, in order for the appellants to succeed they need to establish by prohibitive evidence that: (a) the standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was so inadequate that the appellants were effectively prevented from giving evidence at the hearing; or (b) errors made by the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing were material to the conclusions of the Tribunal adverse to the appellants [see authorities there cited]. 
It should also be remembered that in WACO v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2003] FCAFC 171 the Full Bench said at [66]:
 
 "However, the requirement is not that there be a perfect translation, it suffices that the translation is sufficiently accurate to permit the idea or concept being translated to be communicated. " 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 109">Finally, the applicant told me that the interpreter could not help her communicate very well with the Judge. Apparently, the interpreter had told her about halfway through the hearing that she was not feeling well. Once again I have no evidence of this, other than the applicant's statement. If she really wished to allege that interpreting difficulties were such as to bring her within the scope of authorities such as SZGYM v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1923 , M175 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1212 , SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 , Perera v Minister for Immigration [1999] FCA 507 , she would have to produce some evidence. This could have been from the interpreter herself or from the hearing tape. Once again nothing was produced to me. This Court is only able to deal with matters as they come before it on the day of the hearing. The applicant did not ask for an adjournment to obtain the tape but had she done so, I would have been reluctant to grant it. The applicant has had considerable notice of this hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 1434">The providing of sufficiently competent interpreting services to applicants before the Refugee Review Tribunal is a daily experience for that body, and the Court should be slow to dictate the procedures which it must follow, and the expense which it must incur when doing so. However, a body of judicial authority establishes that there is a duty on the Tribunal to provide a "competent interpreter" , who in fact provides "a reasonably accurate interpretation" of what the applicant wishes to convey to the Tribunal and of what the Tribunal wishes to convey to the applicant, when he or she attends a hearing (cf. SZGYM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1923 at [23] and [27], also Perera v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 507 ; (1999) 92 FCR 6 and other cases discussed in M175 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1212 and VWFY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1723). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 744">The sixth claim made by the applicant related to the interpretation. This matter was raised by the applicant today at the hearing. The applicant claimed that the interpretation was inadequate and did not express the real substance of his evidence. An inadequate interpretation can amount to a breach of s.425 of the Act; SZGYM v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1923 ; SZIWK v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 168 , but in order to obtain relief on this ground the applicant must prove that the interpretation is inadequate. As Middleton J said in SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 at [21] : "With respect to the first ground, in order for the appellants to succeed they need to establish by probative evidence that: (a) The standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was so inadequate that the appellants were effectively prevented from giving evidence at the hearing; or, (b) Errors made by the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing were material to the conclusions of the Tribunal adverse to the appellants. See generally Appellant P119/2002 v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 230 at [17] " (and numerous other authorities cited) 
The applicant has not complied with the strictures identified by Middleton J and has merely asserted a failure of the interpretation at the Tribunal hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 789">32 Other decisions have also recognised that a meaningful opportunity to give evidence and present arguments, in the case of a person who is not fluent in the English language, will only be afforded if an interpreter is present and it is evident that, subject to reasonably accurate interpretation, that which an applicant wishes to convey to the Tribunal and that which the Tribunal wishes to convey to an applicant is fairly interpreted: SZGYM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1923 at [27] . An inadequate translation service may deprive a party of an effective opportunity to present his case where the standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing is so inadequate that the appellant is effectively prevented from giving evidence at the Tribunal: W284 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1788 ; Tobasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 1050 , 122 FCR 322 ; Appellant P119/2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 230. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 462">In a further case the High Court in SZFDE v MIAC [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 237 ALR 64 reiterated that the requirement in s425 of the Migration Act that the Tribunal must provide procedural fairness to an applicant. In SZFDE it was the agent's fraud that corrupted the Tribunal's decision-making process making the Tribunal's decision in law no decision at all. In the unreported Federal Court case of SZGYM v MIAC [2007] FCA 1923 Graham J allowed an appeal on the basis that there was a failure to provide an interpreter speaking the appellant's own dialect. His Honour found there was denial of procedural fairness. Had the applicant or his advisor been provided with a complete audible tape recording of the hearing then a submission would have been made to clarify the applicant's claim and any conflicting country information. No fraud is alleged in the present case. SZFDE is not relevant. Finally, in SZGYM v MIAC (2007) FCA 1923 , Graham J held there was jurisdictional error because of the failure of the Tribunal to provide an interpreter who spoke the applicant's own language dialect at the oral hearing. The applicant does not allege there was any problem with the interpreter he was provided with at the hearing. SZGYM is not relevant.</sentence>
