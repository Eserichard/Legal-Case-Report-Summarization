<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 881">37 In my view, Clough has a prima facie case for the relief variously claimed in that, for reasons I set out below, ONGC would arguably be in breach of the contract and acting contrary to the express terms of the performance guarantees and acting unconscionably, in contravention of s 51AA of the Act, if it were to take further steps in making demands or obtaining payment under the performance guarantees: Merpro Montassa Ltd v Conoco Specialty Products Inc [1991] FCA 70 ; (1991) 28 FCR 387 , 390; Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd (in liq) (1991) 30 FCR 102 , 110; Sydbank Soenderjylland A/S v Bannerton Holdings Pty (1996) 68 FCR 539 , 549; Eurogold Ltd v Oxus Holdings (Malta) Ltd [2006] FCA 1270. It is not necessary for an applicant seeking leave to show a prima facie cause of action in respect of each of the causes of action pleaded: Bray v F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd [2003] FCAFC 153 ; (2003) 130 FCR 317 ; Traxon Industries Pty Ltd v Emerson Electric Co [2006] FCA 450 ; (2006) 230 ALR 297 , 311 [65]. Nevertheless, Clough does so here. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 811">7 On 18 August 2006, I granted the applicants leave to serve the application and statement of claim on each of the respondents out of the jurisdiction ( Eurogold Limited v Oxus Holdings (Malta) Limited [2006] FCA 1270). Oxus Gold now applies under O 9 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules , alternatively pursuant to the implied powers of the Court, for orders that the application be set aside, or alternatively, that the orders of 18 August 2006 be discharged. In the further alternative Oxus Gold seeks orders that the proceeding be stayed on the basis that the forum is inappropriate.</sentence>
