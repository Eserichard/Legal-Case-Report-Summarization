<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWCA 128">Other decisions that an order requiring a legal practitioner to pay the costs of litigation do not need leave to appeal under a provision like s 102(2)(c) SC Act are Macteldir Pty Ltd v Dimoski [2006] FCA 489 ; (2006) 152 FCR 487 per Lindgren J, Etna v Arif [1999] VSCA 99 ; [1999] 2 VR 353 per Batt JA (Charles and Callaway JJA agreeing) at [69], and Emanuel Management Pty Ltd (in liq) v Foster's Brewing Group Ltd [2003] QCA 516 ; [2004] 2 Qd R 11 at [11] - [12] (though obiter) per de Jersey CJ, Davies JA and Mullins J. Like Wilkinson v Kenny , in Martinovic v Chief Executive, Qld Transport [2005] QCA 55 ; [2005] 1 Qd R 502 the Queensland Court of Appeal held that a barrister had no right of appeal without leave against an order that he pay the costs of an application to require him to pay the costs of substantive litigation, when there was no appeal against the finding that he pay the costs of the substantive litigation. However Jerrard JA (White JA agreeing) said at [29] that the obiter remarks in Emanuel at [11]: 
 
"... repeat a principle of long standing, established by the cases cited therein, and which explain that it is not ordinarily within the discretion arising for exercise by a judge as to costs of a proceeding to make an order for payment of costs against a party's lawyer. That power depends on a finding that the lawyer has been guilty of misconduct, and on the latter question there ought to be an appeal without leave. "

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 39">32 See also in this context the judgment of Lindgren J in Macteldir Pty Ltd v Dimoski [2006] FCA 489 ; (2006) 152 FCR 487 , where his Honour said at p 489, par 6, discussing whether an order of dismissal was final or interlocutory:
 'Whether a judgment if final, rather than interlocutory, usually depends on whether it finally determines the rights of the parties in respect of the matter of dispute between them: Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423 at 443 per Windeyer J; Licul v Corney [1976] HCA 6 ; (1976) 180 CLR 213 at 225; Carr v Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd (No 1) [1981] HCA 20 ; (1981) 147 CLR 246 ('Carr') at 248; Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 ('Luck') at [4]. In Carr at 248 and in Luck at [4], it was observed that in applying this test, the Court must have regard to the legal effect, as distinct from the practical effect, of the judgment. In those cases, the full expression used was 'finally determine[s] the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them'. </sentence>
