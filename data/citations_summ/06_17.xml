<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 352">The factors which tend against ordering removal are as follows. First, the liquidators are well acquainted with the affairs of the company. In that circumstance, the onus on the plaintiff to 'show cause' is not easy to discharge: Multi-Core Aerators Pty Ltd v Dye [1999] VSC 205 , [37]. Second, the creditors as a whole support the liquidators. In Re Greight Pty Ltd (2006) FCA 17 , I noted that "in most applications for the removal of a liquidator it is necessary to find out the wishes of the persons really interested, in this case the creditors" (at [18]). In this case, the plaintiff was given an opportunity to put its case that the creditors should appoint as liquidator someone other than Messrs Branden &amp; Kassem. Third, although the plaintiff has raised numerous complaints against the liquidators' conduct as administrators and deed administrators, no complaint has been made about their conduct as liquidators. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 207">The Court has power to make the appointment: see s 473 of the Act and Re Wily [2003] NSWSC 1260 ; (2003) 49 ACSR 94 at [6] . Section 473(1) of the Act provides that a liquidator appointed by the Court may resign or, on cause shown, be removed by the Court. Section 473(7) provides that a vacancy in the office of liquidator must be filled by the Court. The Court not only has the power but must make the appointment if there is a vacancy. In my view, the appointment of Mr Nitikins is appropriate in the circumstances as it ensures that the work undertaken by, and the knowledge of, EY staff in the liquidation of the Scheme Companies and Span is not lost or duplicated. However, as noted by Barrett J in Re Vouris , this appointment is made subject to any application to the Court for Mr Nitikins' removal on cause being shown: s 473(1) of the Act and cf Re Greight Pty Ltd (in liq); Re Stafford Services Pty Ltd (in liq); Handberg v Cant [2006] FCA 17 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 334 at [3] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] VSC 530">47 Finally, it was submitted in support of the Horden application that the liquidators have a conflict of duty in that they hold a 19.4 per cent equity interest in Boundary Bend Ltd, and I refer to paragraph 69(f) of Mr Korda's affidavit. 48 Reference was made to a number of authorities in support of the proposition that the liquidators have a duty to act in the best interests of creditors and others interested in the winding up of all companies of which they are liquidators, referring particularly to the case of Timbercorp Securities in Liquidation v Western Australian Chip &amp; Pulp Co. [2] . 49 In terms of conflicting duties particular reference is made to the judgment of His Honour Finkelstein J, in the Federal Court in a case of re Greight Pty Ltd. [3] His Honour said: 
 
 
 ... If there are, or are likely to be disputes between companies in liquidation that are under the control of one liquidator, then as a general rule different persons should be appointed as liquidator to each company. This is not to say that it is inappropriate to appoint one person as liquidator of a group of companies or of companies that are closely connected, but once the likelihood of conflict becomes apparent it is necessary to take action.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] NSWSC 1068">15 In Re Greight Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 17 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 334 at 338 [18] Finkelstein J pointed out that:

 
 
 "In most applications for the removal of a liquidator it is necessary to find out the wishes of the persons really interested, in this case the creditors: Re Association of Land Financiers (1878) 10 Ch D 269. " </sentence>
