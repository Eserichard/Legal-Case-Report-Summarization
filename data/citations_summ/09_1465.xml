They relate to separate judgments given on 11 December 2009 in the same proceeding --- a representative one under Part IVA of that Act. In the first judgment, the primary Judge struck out the Fourth Amended Statement of Claim, pursuant to O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules , and refused a motion by the applicant to amend the definition of the represented group: Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 5) [2009] FCA 1464. In the second judgment, the primary Judge refused the applicant's application for a transfer of the proceeding to the New South Wales District Registry of the court: Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 6) [2009] FCA 1465. Each application for leave was argued on the basis that, if leave should be granted, we would proceed to hear the appeal. </sentence>
