(2) where diesel fuel is consumed at premises outside the limits of residential premises whether it will be used "at residential premises" will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case applied to the policy of the legislation.  (3) diesel fuel consumed at premises outside the limits of residential premises was used "at" those premises because of common ownership of the premises, their close proximity to the generator, the relationship between the owner and occupants of the residences, the communal and non-commercial operation of the generator and the fact that it genuinely fulfilled the domestic needs of the residents of the premises.</citphrase>

<citphrase id="cp6.13" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 85">administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 (cth), ss. 27 , 28 , 33 , 43 (2), 44 . the minister ordered the deportation of the defendant under s. 12 of the migration act 1958 . upon the defendant's application for review of that decision the administrative appeals tribunal ("the tribunal") recommended its revocation. the minister appealed from that decision on the ground inter alia that the tribunal wrongly regarded itself as being restricted in reaching its decision by misconceived principles of law. the minister relied upon three passages in the tribunal's reasons to establish this ground. the first of those passages read: "when an alien who is an established resident becomes liable to deportation under s. 12 , the general rule must be that the conduct which is relied on to show that a deportation order is in the best interests of australia must be proved, not merely suspected."  held: per curiam</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp6.14" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 85">(1) as to the passages in the decision of the tribunal, other than that set out above, relied upon by the minister, the tribunal had not purported to lay down any binding principle of law but merely what it saw as general principles of fairness and common sense which were considered appropriate to the case before the tribunal and which the president stated in general terms for the guidance of members of the tribunal in the future performance of their functions.  per deane j., with whose reasons for judgment evatt j. agreed</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp6.15" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 85">(2) a similar position existed in relation to the first passage quoted above.  (3) in any event as a matter of law the tribunal was required in the circumstances to observe that principle because: (a) the tribunal is under a duty to observe the requirements of natural justice. sullivan v. department of transport (1978), 20 alr 323 ; drake v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs [1979] aata 179 ; (1979), 24 alr 577 , applied. (b) it is an ordinary requirement of natural justice that a person bound to act judicially "base his decision" upon material which tends logically to show the existence or non-existence of facts relevant to the issue to be determined. r. v. deputy industrial injuries commissioner; ex parte moore, (1965) 1 qb 4568 applied.</citphrase>
