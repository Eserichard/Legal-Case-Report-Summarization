<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCAFC 163">91 As to Du Pont's contention, the primary judge held that there was no identity of any issue decided by Branson J and the Full Court on the one hand and any issue which falls for determination in relation to the opposition to the divisional on the other ( E I Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co v Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (2006) 70 IPR 274 ; [2006] FCA 1402). Consequently, his Honour held that there was no issue estoppel (at [29]). Du Pont maintains that Branson J's findings on novelty with respect to the 005 application give rise to an issue estoppel in the opposition to the divisional that goes to the novelty of the invention so far as claimed in what is now claim 1 (previously dependent claim 4 of the 005 application).
  4 Du Pont argued that ICI's Divisional Application should similarly be rejected, essentially on the basis of various issue estoppels which were said to arise out of the earlier opposition proceedings. Gyles J, dismissed Du Pont's application for injunctive relief, holding that there were no issue estoppels, as claimed. His Honour found that there was no identity between any issue decided by Branson J, or indeed by the Full Court, and any issue which fell for determination in relation to the proposed Divisional Application: E I Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co v Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (2006) 70 IPR 274 ; [2006] FCA 1402. Du Pont now appeals against his Honour's judgment and orders.
