<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1005">In fact for reasons identified in the preceding paragraph they do not follow in this case at all. My views on that matter are fortified by the decision of Heerey J in Nouv v The Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1474. At [12] His Honour stated, "[12] The appellant's argument involved two interrelated points. One of the requirements for the permanent visa is that the applicant is the holder of a provisional visa. Therefore, it was said, although the Tribunal had to consider other criteria as at the time of its decision, it should not have "re-agitated" the issue whether at the time of the grant of the provisional visa the criteria for the grant of that visa were or were not satisfied. Due to his failure to act on an earlier determination the Applicant conceded in his written outline (at [24]) that it was open to the Tribunal to make a fresh determination on the issue of a spousal relationship. Clearly the Tribunal could do so in the proper exercise of its powers: Ho v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 1285 , Nouv v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1474 , El Mohamad v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 345.  It follows the Applicant's submissions that the previous administrative decision in relation to a temporary visa provide prima facie proof of the alleged fact to a subsequent decision maker does not strictly follow. In fact for reasons identified in the preceding paragraph they do not follow in this case at all. My views on that matter are fortified by the decision of Heerey J in Nouv v The Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1474. At [12] His Honour stated, "[12] The appellant's argument involved two interrelated points. One of the requirements for the permanent visa is that the applicant is the holder of a provisional visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 1716">5. The applicant also argued that the Tribunal failed to consider the evidentiary significance of findings as to the prior existence of a "spouse" relationship, made by the delegate when granting the 309 visa. It is argued that it was bound by law to have regard to these findings. I have not found it necessary to address this argument. I do, however, note that it appears contrary to authority (see Ho v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 1285 at [30] , Nouv v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1474 at [14] , Latt v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 766 at [32] , and Herft v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 756 at [11] ). I also note that, in the particular circumstances of this case, it may be difficult to conclude that the findings of the delegate as to the spousal relationship existing at two dates in 2002 were overlooked by the Tribunal, before it made findings addressing their relationship at a later time.</sentence>
