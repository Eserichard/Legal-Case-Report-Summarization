<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWCA 81">His Honour then referred to various authorities that he said supported his view "that joinder is available against an insurer of a defendant that has a utility and avoids multiplicity of proceedings" (Judgment [31]). These authorities included the decision of French J (as his Honour then was) in Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd v Beekink (No 2) [2007] FCA 1421 ; (2007) 244 ALR 534 and the decision of the Full Federal Court on appeal in the same matter in Employers Reinsurance Corporation v Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 28 ; [2008] 166 FCR 398. He also referred to the decision of Vickery J in Anjin No 13 Pty Ltd v Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd [2009] VSC 371. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] WASC 53">102 The plaintiffs rely heavily on the decision of French J in Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd v Beekink (No 2) [2007] FCA 1421 ; (2007) 244 ALR 534 , and on the decision of the Full Federal Court dismissing the appeal from that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1413">As a matter of general principle, a declaration will not be granted unless the court is satisfied both that the declaration sought is appropriate and that is would have sufficient practical utility in resolving the matter that is before the court: Neeta (Epping) Pty Ltd v Phillips [1974] HCA 18 ; (1974) 131 CLR 286. For example, if the subject matter of the dispute has been superseded by events such that the applicant's present or future legal rights or commercial or personal interests will not be affected by a determination of that matter, then this provides a cogent reason for refusing to grant that form of relief: Gardner v Dairy Industry Authority of New South Wales (1977) 18 ALR 55 at 69; Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd v Beekink (No 2) (2007) 244 ALR 534 ; [2007] FCA 1421 at [40] . As the decision in Neeta itself recognises (at 307), it is also generally undesirable that a court should grant declaratory relief without consequential relief, unless the parties are agreed on the consequences which flow from the declaration itself. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] NSWSC 978">


 
36 French J, at first instance ( Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd v Beekink (No 2) [2007] FCA 1421 ; 244 ALR 534) adopted the approach taken by Davies JA in Interchase and granted the plaintiffs leave to seek a declaration against the insurer. In dismissing the appeal, the Full Court at 410 [52] held that the investors had a real interest in establishing, if they could, that the insurers were liable to indemnify the responsible entity against the claims made against it by the investors. They had standing to claim declaratory relief against the insurers. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] VSC 371">34 Whether or not it is open to a court to make a declaration of the kind sought in this case has been considered in Australia, commencing with three decisions, namely JN Taylor Holdings Ltd (In Liquidation) &amp; Anor v Alan Bond &amp; Ors; [5] Beneficial Finance Corp v Price Waterhouse; [6] and CE Heath v Pyramid Building Society. [7] Each of these cases emerged out of spectacular institutional collapses of the late 1980's and early 1990's in Australia. The principles applied in these cases received further attention in Tatterson v Wirtanen (as Executrix of the Estate of Wirtanen); [8] and Interchase Corporation Ltd (in liq) v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd; [9] Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd v Beekink (No 2), [10] and Employers Reinsurance Corporation v Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd. [11] Each of these cases will be considered in turn. 
 
 JN Taylor Holdings Ltd (In liq) v Bond  60 The issue arose again for consideration in Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd v Beekink (No 2), [33] this time in the Federal Court in Western Australia. French J had cause to consider the joinder of two insurers in circumstances where investors in a registered management scheme commenced proceedings against the former directors of the company which was the responsible entity for the scheme (the "Scheme Liability Proceeding"). They also sought leave to proceed against the company which was in liquidation. The company was covered by a Professional Indemnity Insurance Policy during the relevant period and gave notice to its insurers of the claims against it.  84 In any event, I prefer to follow the reasoning of Gillard J in Tatterson v Wirtanen (as Executrix of the Estate of Wirtanen) [45] and French J in Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd v Beekink (No 2) [46] and that of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Employers Reinsurance Corporation v Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd. [47]  67 The issue arose again, this time before the Full Court of the Federal Court in Employers Reinsurance Corporation v Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd. [38] This was an appeal from the decision of French J in Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd v Beekink (No 2). [39] The Full Court upheld the decision of French J at first instance. </sentence>
