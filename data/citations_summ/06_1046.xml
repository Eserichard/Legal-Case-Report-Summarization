<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 695">148 In Nine Films &amp; Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2006] FCA 1046 Tamberlin J fixed costs in the sum of $650,000. An order had been sought fixing costs at $843,199.42. In doing so, his Honour acknowledged that:
 
 
 the exercise is one of estimation or assessment and not of arithmetic calculation or precision ... [T]he rule contemplates the application of a much broader brush than that applied on taxation. The approach must be logical, fair and reasonable, and should only be exercised when the court considers that it can do so fairly as between the parties: at [8]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 693">What are the applicable principles? In Ginos Engineers Pty Ltd v Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1051 ; (2008) 249 ALR 371 at [22] --- [24], Finn J described them as follows: Rules of Court such as r 21.02(2)(a) of the FMC Rules and O 62 r 4(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules , which empower a court to order a gross amount in costs instead of an amount determined after taxation, are well accepted as being directed to the avoidance of expense, delay and the protraction of litigation, whether the case be a complex or a simple one: see Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 at 120 ( Beach Petroleum NL ); Australasian Performing Rights Association Ltd v Marlin [1999] FCA 1006 ; Nine Films &amp; Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2006] FCA 1046 ( Nine Films &amp; Television ); see generally on fixing of costs by courts, GE Dal Pont, Law of Costs , Butterworths, Sydney (2003) para [15.14] and following R Quick and DJ Garnsworthy, Quick on Costs , looseleaf, LBS Information Services, Sydney, para [6.20]. It is inconsistent both with the terms of r 21.02(2)(a) and to the clear objective in making a lump sum order that the costs in issue be subjected to the detailed scrutiny often applied in taxations: Leary v Leary [1987] 1 All ER 261 at 265; Dal Pont, 2003 para [15.17] and [15.19]. In specifying a lump sum, it is well accepted that it is appropriate to apply a "much broader brush" than would be applied on a taxation: see Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788 at [196] --- [200] ( Sony Entertainment ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] WASC 74">Consistent with that objective, in fixing the sum the court will not subject the costs to the detailed scrutiny often applied in taxation of costs. It is appropriate instead to apply a 'much broader brush' than would be applied on a taxation: see Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788 [197] - [200]; Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc [2000] FCA 628 [35]. But in fixing the amount of the costs, the approach of the court should be 'logical, fair and reasonable': see Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 , 123; Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2006] FCA 1046 [8]. And the power to award a fixed sum should only be exercised when the court considers that it can determine the amount of the costs fairly. That means the court must have available to it sufficient material that it is confident it can arrive at an appropriate sum: see Harrison v Schipp [2002] NSWCA 213 ; (2002) 54 NSWLR 738 [22].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] WASC 12">5 The purpose of fixing costs is to avoid the expense and delay involved in a taxation. The court does not subject the costs to the detailed scrutiny often applied in taxation of costs, but applies a 'broader brush' than would be applied on taxation: Brookvista Pty Ltd v Meloni [2009] WASCA 180 [26] (Newnes JA). His Honour continued at [27]:
 
 But in fixing the amount of the costs, the approach of the court should be 'logical, fair and reasonable': see Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 , 123; Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2006] FCA 1046 [8]. And the power to award a fixed sum should only be exercised when the court considers that it can determine the amount of the costs fairly. That means the court must have available to it sufficient material that it is confident it can arrive at an appropriate sum: see Harrison v Schipp [2002] NSWCA 213 ; (2002) 54 NSWLR 738 [22].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1413">Pursuant to O 62 r 4(2)(c) the Court may order that, instead of taxed costs, costs be awarded as a gross sum. The purpose of the order is to "save the parties the time, trouble, delay, expense and aggravation in having a taxation proceed on a matter": Keen v Telstra Corp Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 930 at [4]; Nine Films &amp; Television Pty Limited v Ninox Television Limited [2006] FCA 1046 ; Macquarie Bank Ltd v Seagle (2008) 79 IPR 72 ; [2008] FCA 1417 at [30] . The power is not confined and may be exercised whenever the circumstances warrant its exercise: Su v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (No 3) [2008] FCA 2018 at [1] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FamCAFC 197">Counsel for the husband also referred us to Brookvista Pty Ltd v Meloni [2009] WASCA 180 (" Brookvista ") where a lump sum costs order was set aside, inter alia, on the basis that the assessment of quantum had involved an element of "guesswork". Newnes JA, with whom Buss JA agreed, said: As I have mentioned, a court has a wide discretion in relation to costs... The purpose of fixing costs is to avoid the expense and delay involved in taxation. Consistent with that objective, in fixing the sum the court will not subject the costs to the detailed scrutiny often applied in taxation of costs. It is appropriate instead to apply a 'much broader brush' than would be applied on a taxation: see Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788 [197] - [200]; Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc [2000] FCA 628 [35]. But in fixing the amount of the costs, the approach of the court should be 'logical, fair and reasonable': see Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 , 123; Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2006] FCA 1046 [8]. And the power to award a fixed sum should only be exercised when the court considers that it can determine the amount of the costs fairly. That means the court must have available to it sufficient material that it is confident it can arrive at an appropriate sum: see Harrison v Schipp [2002] NSWCA 213 ; (2002) 54 NSWLR 738 [22]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 392">When the power conferred by O 62 r 4(2)(c) is exercised, the task undertaken by the Court is thus " one of estimation or assessment and not of arithmetic calculation or precision ": Nine Films &amp; Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2006] FCA 1046 at [8] . Tamberlin J there further observed that the rule " contemplates the application of a much broader brush than that applied on taxation. The approach must be logical, fair and reasonable ". Although a " broader brush " may be applied, the discretion to make a lump sum order --- no less than the general discretion to order costs --- " must be exercised judicially and in accordance with principle ": Ginos Engineers Pty Ltd v Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1051 at [23] , [2008] FCA 1051 ; 249 ALR 371 at 377 per Finn J. By way of example, in circumstances where a party did not oppose fixing costs in the sum of $183,000, but where the Court was not prepared to assess costs in that amount, an order was made for the payment of costs fixed in the sum of $70,000: Moss v Insurance Australia Ltd [2005] FCA 87 per Jacobson J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] WASCA 180">27 But in fixing the amount of the costs, the approach of the court should be 'logical, fair and reasonable': see Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 , 123; Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2006] FCA 1046 [8]. And the power to award a fixed sum should only be exercised when the court considers that it can determine the amount of the costs fairly. That means the court must have available to it sufficient material that it is confident it can arrive at an appropriate sum: see Harrison v Schipp [2002] NSWCA 213 ; (2002) 54 NSWLR 738 [22]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 1051">22 Rules of Court such as r 21.02(2)(a) of the FMC Rules and O 62 r 4(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules , which empower a court to order a gross amount in costs instead of an amount determined after taxation, are well accepted as being directed to the avoidance of expense, delay and the protraction of litigation, whether the case be a complex or a simple one: see Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 at 120; Australasian Performing Rights Association Ltd v Marlin [1999] FCA 1006 ; Nine Films &amp; Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2006] FCA 1046 ; see generally on fixing of costs by courts, Dal Pont, Law of Costs (2003) at [15.14] ff and Quick on Costs at [6.20].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 701"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 2059">33 I was referred to a number of Federal Court cases in order to illustrate the range of gross sum costs orders that have been made. The range, measured by reference to the percentage of total costs and disbursements allowed by the Court, is quite wide. The cases to which I was referred include Beach Petroleum v Johnson (No 2) (a gross sum costs award equivalent to 64.7 per cent of the successful party's total costs and disbursements); Canvas Graphics Pty Ltd v Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd (unreported, O'Loughlin J, 23 January 1998) (38.19 per cent of the amount claimed ); Datadot Technology Ltd v Alpha Microtech Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1449 (59.05 per cent of total costs and disbursements); Williams Advanced Materials Inc v Target Technology Co LLC [2004] FCA 1405 (65 per cent); Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2006] FCA 1046 (67.31 per cent); Sparnon v Apand Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 164 (60.98 per cent); and Sony Entertainment (Australia) Limited v Smith [2005] FCA 228 (40.79 per cent). If these cases are any guide, most awards seem to fall broadly within the range of 60 to 70 per cent of total costs and disbursements, although sometimes the award may amount to less than 40 per cent of total costs and disbursements. As Mr Sheahan pointed out, none of the cases appears to have allowed the proportion of total costs claimed by Telstra in this case (77.24 per cent).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FMCA 2156">Rule 21.02(2)(a) of the FMCA Rules allows the Court to set the amount of costs. I am satisfied, on the basis of the cases of Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2006] FCA 1046 and Australasian Performing Rights Association Ltd v Marlin [1999] FCA 1006 that this is an appropriate case for me to set the amount of the costs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] QPEC 95">At paragraph 5.13 of his written application, Mr Wallace refers to a relevant statement of principle of Tamberlin J in Nine Films and Television Proprietary Limited v Ninocks Television Limited (2006) FCA 1046 at paragraph 8: 
 
 
 "In fixing a lump sum the exercise is one of estimation or assessment and not of arithmetic calculation or precision ... (the) Rule contemplates the application of a much broader brush than that applied on taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] NSWSC 23">The principles and approaches are also set out and considered by von Doussa J in Sparnon &amp; Ors v Apand Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 164 in which his Honour fixed a gross amount of $634,320.54 where the actual costs paid by the client totalled $1,040,135.80. This amounted to a discount of some 39%. " [2006] FCA 1046 at [8] 
 
[The NAB Parties have drawn attention to the fact that even applying a "necessary and proper test", Tamberlin J allowed 77.1% of the total amount claimed in Nine Films and Television Pty Limited v Ninox Television Limited at [10]

xvi. evidence from expert costs consultants as to the likely range of usual recoveries in large commercial cases on assessment is of particular value to the Court on a gross sum costs application, if it is accompanied by an identification of the factors that might assist in determining where within that range a particular matter might fall. xvii. the Court is entitled to ultimately form a different view to the costs consultant as to where a case might fall within that range, given its own appreciation of the material relevant to a particular factor (for example the need for, scope and content of expert evidence relied upon by a successful party). 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2006] FCA 1186">Order 62 rule 4 confers what has been called an unlimited discretion, which of course must be exercised in a judicial manner. How the powers are to be used varies widely from case to case and each case must be decided on its own merits: Leary v Leary [1987] 1 WLR 72 at 76. The approach to be adopted to an application under Order 62 rule 4(c) has recently been described in Sony Entertainment v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788 at 812-813. There Jacobson J quoted (at 813) with approval the following passage from the judgment of Giles J in Harrison v Schipp [2002] NSWCA 213 ; (2002) 54 NSWLR 738 at [22] : 
 
 approach taken to estimate costs must be logical, fair and reasonable. The power should only be exercised when the Court considers that it can do so fairly between the parties, and that includes sufficient confidence in arriving at an appropriate sum on the materials available. "
