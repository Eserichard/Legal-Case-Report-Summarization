<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1342">In Power v Ekstein [2010] NSWSC 137 ; (2010) 77 ACSR 302 at 331, Austin J observed that the principles in Re DG Brims and Sons Pty Ltd had been approved in the following Australian cases: 
 
 
 Young J in Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd [1998] NSWSC 413 ; (1998) 28 ACSR 688 at 733 ; [1998] NSWSC 413 ; BC9804582, and by White J in Cassegrain v CTK Engineering Pty Ltd (2005) 54 ACSR 249 ; [2005] NSWSC 495 at [90] ---[91]; see also Metropolitan Petar v Mitreski [2008] NSWSC 243 ; Grace v Grace [2007] NSWSC 6 ; compare Sellar v Lasotav Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1766 ( Sellar ). 
 
 
  In Sellar v Lasotav Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1766 (" Sellar "), Foster J expressed a somewhat different view. His Honour considered it would be very rare, at the interlocutory stage, to interfere with the payment of legal fees and expenses unless there is good reason to do so. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 137">


 
113 These principles were approved by Young J in Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd [1998] NSWSC 413 ; (1998) 28 ACSR 688 at 733; [1998] NSWSC 138 , and by White J in Cassegrain v CTK Engineering Pty Ltd (2005) 54 ACSR 249 ; [2005] NSWSC 495 at [90] - [91]; see also Metropolitan Petar v Mitreski [2008] NSWSC 243 ; Grace v Grace [2007] NSWSC 6 ; compare Sellar v Lasotav Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1766. The last of these cases indicates a different approach to the other authorities. According to Foster J in Sellar (at [30]), the Court will be generally reluctant to interfere at the interlocutory stage of the payment of legal fees and expenses unless there is good reason to do so. With respect, while that may be so as a general proposition, it is not an accurate reflection of the approach in Australian and English authority where the question relates to expenditure of company funds on costs of litigation involving a dispute between shareholders.</sentence>
