<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 783">If required to do so, however, I would place significant weight on the fact that the claim of inadequate interpretation has never been the subject of any judicial consideration before this proceeding. Further, the appellant has not had the benefit of legal representation before this proceeding. It is true that lack of legal representation is insufficient of itself to avoid an Anshun estoppel ( MZWKJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 761 at [19] ; MZWGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1501 at [11] ). But that is not the only relevant factor in this case. Substantial resources have been necessary to mount the argument including the preparation of the transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal and the obtaining of Ms Qian's evidence. The Minister referred to the decision in MZWKJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 761 , in which an Anshun estoppel was found to arise. But that case involved different facts. In that case, the applicants had made an application to the High Court for an order nisi in respect of the Tribunal's decision. The High Court remitted the matter to this Court. Weinberg J refused the application and Finkelstein J then refused an application for leave to appeal (at [3]). The applicants then filed an application for review with the Federal Magistrates Court. The Federal Magistrate found an Anshun estoppel. On appeal Kenny J agreed. The facts of that case are thus analogous to Applicant A321 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 306 (discussed above) and dissimilar from the present case. </sentence>
