<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 766">If by the expression "during the bankruptcy" his Honour was intending to refer to the period during which a person is an undischarged bankrupt then the view noted by his Honour is not consistent with the decisions in Cheesman or Macchia . However, his Honour also found (at [43]-[44]) that even if ss 178 or 179 could be availed of in that case, for other reasons the proceedings were bound to have failed and thus the orders made by the primary judge ( Zegarac v Rambaldi [2009] FCA 1463) were not open to sufficient doubt to warrant their reconsideration by a Full Court. It is important to observe that the applicant appeared in person and the respondent trustee did not appear. His Honour does not appear to have been provided with any real assistance by the applicant. In particular it does not seem that the decisions in Todd and Cheesman were drawn to his Honour's attention. His Honour's reasons do include a passing reference to Macchia , but on a point different to that now under consideration. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 219">The nature and history of the proceeding
 By notice of motion filed on 18 December 2009, the applicant applied for leave to appeal from the judgment of a single judge of the Court, in proceeding no VID 518 of 2009 ("the principal proceeding"). The learned primary judge ordered that the title of that proceeding be amended by substituting Mr Gess Rambaldi and Mr Andrew Yeo as respondents in place of the originally named respondent, Pitcher Partners. His Honour also ordered that the principal proceeding be dismissed and that the applicant (also the applicant in the present motion) pay the respondents' costs of the proceeding. See Zegarac v Rambaldi [2009] FCA 1463. </sentence>
