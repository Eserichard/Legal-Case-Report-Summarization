<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 201">On 8 October 2009 the Federal Court dismissed Mr Ibrahim's application for leave to appeal in Ibrahim and Worken Pty Ltd . [3] Having found that the application ought to be dismissed the Federal Court observed as follows: 40. I consider I should add that it is important for the applicant, if he wished seriously to pursue the proceeding he has commenced in the Federal Magistrates Court, to ensure compliance with orders made by the Federal Magistrate from time to time that are designed to enable the parties to present their cases adequately at a final hearing. Interlocutory applications for leave to appeal of this kind are only apt to delay the whole process and add expense to the process, neither of which can be considered to the advantage of any of the parties. [4]  Consequently, this Court ordered as follows on 16 November 2009: 1. The matter be adjourned until after the High Court has dealt with Mr Ibrahim's intended application for special leave to appeal the judgment of Justice Barker of the Federal Court. 
 AND THE COURT NOTES that the judgment of Justice Barker referred to above is Ibrahim v Worken Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1146.
