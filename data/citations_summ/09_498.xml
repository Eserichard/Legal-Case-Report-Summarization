<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 907">Even in the absence of an order pursuant to O 43, however, it should be noted that s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) confers adequate power to make an order against the father. In Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 at 192 to 193 Mason CJ and Deane J observed: 
 For our part, we consider it appropriate to recognize a general category of case in which an order for costs should be made against a non-party and which would encompass the case of a receiver of a company who is not a party to the litigation. That category of case consists of circumstances where the party to the litigation is an insolvent person or man of straw, where the non-party has played an active part in the conduct of the litigation and where the non-party, or some person on whose behalf he or she is acting or by whom he or she has been appointed, has an interest in the subject of the litigation. Where the circumstances of a case fall within that category, an order for costs should be made against the non-party if the interests of justice require that it be made.

Even had an order not been made pursuant to O 43, an order would nevertheless have been made that the father pay the costs of the appeal . The father had filed the Notice of Appeal ostensibly as " guardian " and sought to advance a case which, if successful, would have been of benefit to his children and perhaps himself. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 590">However as I have already indicated, in my view Mrs Tracy is adequately compensated in respect of the additional directions hearing as well as in respect of any further submissions by a costs order in her favour. While regrettable, I do not consider that any inconvenience occasioned to Mrs Tracy in order for her to comply with the requirement for cross-examination at the hearing of the notice of motion is an adequate basis for an award of indemnity costs against the first and second respondents in these proceedings. Contrary to Mrs Tracy's submissions, I note that in Citrus (No 10) [2009] FCA 498 I actually found that Mrs Tracy had provided some financial support for the applicants' claims in the substantive proceedings, for example in relation to her assistance in providing the security for costs which the applicants were ordered to pay. However I then went on to find that any financial benefit Mrs Tracy would receive had the applicants been successful would not, without more, justify an award of non-party costs. Considering the claims of the first and second respondents in respect of the notice of motion, I note that learned and feasible arguments were advanced. In Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 10) [2009] FCA 498 I dismissed a notice of motion filed by the first and second respondents to the substantive proceedings in which they sought an order for non-party costs against Mrs Adrienne Tracy, the wife of the second applicant to the substantive proceedings. At the time of delivery of judgment I made directions permitting the parties to make written submissions as to costs in respect of the notice of motion, to be filed by 4.00 pm on 29 May 2009, and which submissions I indicated I would take into consideration in making my decision as to costs. I made it clear at that time that final submissions (if any) were to be made by the parties in accordance with the directions. The parties understood that directions were made on that basis. The first and second respondents complied with those directions, and filed submissions on 29 May 2009. Mrs Tracy filed submissions last Monday, one business day late, however I do not consider that any prejudice is occasioned to the first and second respondents as a result of this late filing. </sentence>
