<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 662"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 363">The proceedings have considerable history. On 20 December 2006 an application was brought for what was then non-party discovery against WorleyParsons. This was granted on 23 April 2007: Lynx Engineering Consultants Pty Ltd v The ANI Corporation Limited [2007] FCA 578. Lynx relies in part upon that judgment as support for the argument that it is arguable that it will be entitled to relief against WorleyParsons. (I consider the earlier decision does not directly afford support of this nature. The relevant tests for non party-discovery and for summary dismissal are different). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1510">16 On 27 April 2007, Nicholson J made orders that WorleyParsons provide preliminary discovery of the documents, the subject of the applicant's notice of motion. In addition, his Honour also made an order that there be liberty to the applicant to apply for an order for the examination of WorleyParsons by its appropriate officer under O 15A r 3(2) of the Rules ( Lynx Engineering Consultants Pty Ltd v The ANI Corporation Limited [2007] FCA 578). </sentence>
