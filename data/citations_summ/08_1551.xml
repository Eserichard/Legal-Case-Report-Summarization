<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1806">This is similar to the notice in NTD8 , albeit it was limited to the latter aspect and that ultimately became the sole focus of those proceedings: see [2008] FCA 1551 at [12] and [14]. &#8226; Paragraph 2 applies to treatment for "sexual and/or physical abuse". In NTD8 , the applicant elected not to pursue its challenge to the similar part of the notice in those proceedings: see [2008] FCA 1551 at [14] . &#8226; Given that paragraph 2 specifically applies to children who have been treated for sexual and/or physical abuse, while it is not expressed to be so limited, I consider it can be inferred that paragraph 3 is solely directed to adult patients of C Inc because it refers to almost the same causes for the treatment i.e. sexual assaults or domestic violence assaults. 14 By comparison to the notice Mr Anderson issued in NTD8 , the notice in this matter includes the following distinguishing features:
 
&#8226; Paragraphs 1 and 2 apply to patients of C Inc who are under the age of 18 years and, therefore, are children. In this respect, these paragraphs are similar to the notice in NTD8 : see [2008] FCA 1551 at [12] . However, unlike in NTD8 , where eight teenage girls who had received contraceptive treatment were indirectly identified as the patients, these paragraphs do not identify (whether directly, or indirectly) any details of the child patients who may be affected by the notice. &#8226; Paragraph 1 applies to treatment for "sexually transmitted illnesses, pregnancies or ... services relating to contraception and terminations of pregnancies". However, unlike in NTD8 , where eight teenage girls who had received contraceptive treatment were indirectly identified as the patients, these paragraphs do not identify (whether directly, or indirectly) any details of the child patients who may be affected by the notice. &#8226; Paragraph 1 applies to treatment for "sexually transmitted illnesses, pregnancies or ... services relating to contraception and terminations of pregnancies". This is similar to the notice in NTD8 , albeit it was limited to the latter aspect and that ultimately became the sole focus of those proceedings: see [2008] FCA 1551 at [12] and [14]. &#8226; Paragraph 2 applies to treatment for "sexual and/or physical abuse". In NTD8 , the applicant elected not to pursue its challenge to the similar part of the notice in those proceedings: see [2008] FCA 1551 at [14] . sexual assaults or domestic violence assaults. I will therefore proceed to consider this matter on that assumption. Again, in NTD8 the applicant elected not to pursue its challenge to the similar part of the notice in those proceedings: see [2008] FCA 1551 at [14] . 5 Initially it was thought that these two sets of proceedings could proceed to hearing at the same time. However, it later became apparent that despite the close similarity between the two sets of proceedings, somewhat different factual and legal issues arose for consideration in each matter. As a result, I heard NTD8 's application about two weeks before I heard this application. I have already delivered my decision in NTD8 : see NTD8 v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2008] FCA 1551 (' NTD8 '). </sentence>
