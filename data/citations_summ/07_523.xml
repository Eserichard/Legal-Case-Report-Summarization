<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 5">73 In most proceedings where one party fails, it will be 'usual' and just to order that party to pay the successful party's costs. Often it will be unexceptionable for the Court to proceed upon the basis that the successful party should have the benefit of an order for costs in that party's favour because the substantive decision of the proceedings warrants that outcome. But, there was a marked difference here between the positions of the NSI parties, who were active protagonists in the battle, and the Probiotec parties, who were found by his Honour to have taken 'no active part in argument or in the conduct of the proceeding' ( NSI Dental [2007] FCA 523 at [23] ). In my opinion, the Probiotec parties did not put the University parties to the expense of the fully contested hearing conducted against the NSI parties. Once the Probiotec parties had pleaded a denial of the validity of the complex patent and had not admitted the validity of the phosphopeptide patent, the University parties were obliged to prove their validity as against them. But that proof would have been in an uncontested trial had the NSI parties not been actively pursuing their similar defences and the separate invalidity proceedings. The costs which were incurred by the University parties were due largely to the extensive contest fought out between them and the NSI parties in which the Probiotec parties took no part. There is no basis to throw onto the Probiotec parties the whole burden of costs based on the conduct of the NSI parties. </sentence>
