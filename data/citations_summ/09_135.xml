<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 94">Hills also relied on the decision of Bennett J in Pioneer Computers Australia Pty Ltd v Pioneer KK [2009] FCA 135 ; 176 FCR 300. In that case Pioneer KK was able to show it had used its mark on some but not all of the goods in respect of which it was registered. It sought to persuade the Court to exercise its discretion under s 101(3) to allow the mark to remain on the Register in respect of all of the goods covered by the original registration notwithstanding there was no evidence of use of some of the goods. Pioneer KK argued that the public interest would be best served by the mark remaining on the Register in its original form. Brand extension and the convergence of digital technology meant there was a likelihood of deception and confusion amongst consumers if particular goods were excised from Pioneer's registration. Justice Bennett accepted Pioneer KK's argument and in an exercise of the Court's discretion under s 101(3) allowed the registration to remain unamended.  Bitek submitted that s 101(4), which was inserted into the Act by the Trade Marks Amendment Act 2006 (Cth), does not alter the discretionary power afforded to the Court under s 101(3). Section 101(4) merely informs s 101(3) because the use of a trade mark on closely related goods could already be taken into account under s 101(3): Pioneer Computers Australia Pty Ltd v Pioneer KK [2009] FCA 135 ; 176 FCR 300.  Hills on the other hand argued that the specification provides a statement of goods which includes "digital and electronic products" and then particularises that general description by reference to "televisions, video players, DVD players, CD players, decoders and cameras". It argued that the specification of the statement of goods should be read with due recognition that the types of goods falling within that inclusive specification may well expand or vary as technology develops. It relied upon a decision of Bennett J in Pioneer Computers Australia Pty Ltd v Pioneer KK [2009] FCA 135 ; (2009) 176 FCR 300 which, in turn, relied upon Magnavox (Aust) Pty Ltd's Trade Mark (1964) 34 AOJP 2075 at 2078. It also relied upon a statement of the delegate who determined the opposition presently under appeal: 
 
 Registration 901020 is for a broad range of goods, namely digital and electronic products. Although it describes "televisions, video players, DVD players, CD players, decoders and cameras" as being included in the category of "digital and electronic products" its registration is not limited to those specific goods. 
 

  In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; 66 IPR 131 I rejected a contention that s 101(3) required the party seeking the exercise of the discretion to show "exceptional circumstances". Flick J arrived at the same conclusion in E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 ; (2008) 77 IPR 69 at [198] which was not overturned by the Full Court on the appeal. So also did Bennett J in Pioneer Computers Australia Pty Ltd v Pioneer KK [2009] FCA 135 ; 176 FCR 300 at [168] .  Hills said that the practice was, in applications under s 92 of the Act, to specify clearly which goods or services are the subject of the non-use application. It said that it was unaware of any decision whereby specific goods were removed or excluded from a trade mark registration under s 92 of the Act without first being particularised by the applicant for removal. It relied on a series of decisions which indicated that the practice was that the application for removal should particularise the goods which were to be removed from the trade mark registration: McHatten v Australian Specialised Vehicle Systems Pty Ltd (1996) 34 IPR 537 ; Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 ; (2001) 107 FCR 166 ; Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; 66 IPR 131 ; and Pioneer Computers Australia Pty Ltd v Pioneer KK [2009] FCA 135 ; 176 FCR 300.  Hills also said that Bitek should not be allowed to limit its application because to do so would lead to a denial of procedural fairness. Hills argued that Bitek's "last minute" particularisation of the goods it seeks to have removed from the Register was "contrary to the established procedure" of the Court. The Court's procedure, Hills argued, requires the goods the subject of the application for removal to be particularised so as to allow the registered proprietor of the trade mark to prepare its case to rebut the allegation of non-use. This it argued was important because the registered proprietor bears the onus of rebutting allegations of non-use under s 100(2) of the Act: McHattan v Australian Specialised Vehicle Systems Pty Ltd 34 IPR 537 , Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 ; 51 IPR 149 , Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; 66 IPR 131 and Pioneer Computers Australia Pty Ltd v Pioneer KK [2009] FCA 135 ; 176 FCR 300. Those cases show it was said by Hills that sufficient particularisation of the allegations of non-use is central to an application for removal.  Hills argued that in McHatten v Australian Specialised Vehicle Systems Pty Ltd 34 IPR 537 , Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; 66 IPR 131 and Pioneer Computers Australia Pty Ltd v Pioneer KK [2009] FCA 135 ; 176 FCR 300 the application particularised the goods which the applicants sought to have removed or excluded from the relevant registration which properly allowed each of the owners of the registered mark to rebut the allegation of non-use. On the other hand, in Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 ; 107 FCR 166 , the removal application applied to all goods in the relevant registration and the matter was determined by reference to the use in relation to any of the goods. Hills contended that, in the absence of any particularisation by Bitek of specific goods, the Court should not allow Bitek at trial to specify certain goods for removal or exclusion. </sentence>

The discretion under s 101(3) is a broad discretion to decide not to remove a trade mark from the Register or not to carve out some of the goods and services for which the mark is registered, even if s 92 grounds have been made out, if the Registrar [or the Court] is satisfied that it is reasonable to do so. Irrespective of the lack of use of the trade marks on the removal goods and the removal services in the relevant period, there is a discretion not to alter the registrations. In Kowa Company at [98], Lander J rejected the submission that a party seeking the exercise of the discretion needs to show "exceptional circumstances". In E &amp; J Gallo at [198], Flick J agreed with Lander J that there is no requirement to establish exceptional circumstances. ... In E &amp; J Gallo at [202]-[203], Flick J stated that the following factors set out by Falconer J in Hermes Trade Mark [1982] RPC 425 were of assistance in considering the exercise of the discretion: 
 there had been no abandonment of the trade mark; the registered proprietors of the mark still had a residual reputation in the mark; there had been sales by the registered proprietors of goods for which removal was sought since the relevant period ended; the applicants for removal had entered the market without having taken steps to ascertain from the Register whether anyone had a right to exclude their use of the mark; the registered proprietors were not aware of the applicant's sales under the mark. </sentence>
