<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 255">I have had regard, of course, to the provisions of the Evidence Act . I have considered the observations of Finn J in CA Henschke &amp; Co &amp; Anor v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1561 (1999) 47 IPR 63. I have also considered the Full Court's observations in CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 ; (2000) 52 IPR 42 in relation to one aspect of the matter involving the treatment of the evidence of a man called Mr Peter Forrestal. I have also had regard to the discussion at [ 29060 ], Cross on Evidence , Eighth Ed. ; Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 ; Gambro Pty Ltd v Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1828 ; (2007) 245 ALR 15 ; Mckay v Commissioner of Main Roads [2009] WASC 353. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] TASSC 109">154 I formed the view that it was not correct to say that Dr Prem's opinion resided in the parts of the evidence objected to. It seemed to me that his approach was a co-ordinated one involving numerical modelling with the datasets then being applied to the whole of vehicle modelling by way of the software program. This was to verify the numerical modelling, the end stage of which was the DVD model which was a graphic representation of an outcome which he could have, and did in reports, describe in words. I took the view that there were insufficient deficiencies in the disclosure of the values used to make the material inadmissible as being irrelevant pursuant to the Evidence Act , s55. Further, I did not think that any deficiencies were of sufficient proportions to prevent me from concluding that the opinion was wholly or substantially based on Dr Prem's knowledge, within the meaning of s79 ; see Neowarra v Western Australia [2003] FCA 1399 ; (2003) 205 ALR 145 at [16] --- [27], and Gambro Motel Pty Ltd v Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1828 ; (2007) 245 ALR 15 at [44] . I took the view that the issue was correctly described as one of the weight to be attributed to the evidence objected to rather than its admissibility. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] WASC 353">6 The only decision relied on by the plaintiffs is the decision of Allsop J in Gambro Pty Ltd v Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1828 ; (2007) 245 ALR 15. That case demonstrates that expert evidence may be able to be given about how people in a particular market behave or might be expected to behave. To my mind, that proposition is not in doubt.</sentence>
