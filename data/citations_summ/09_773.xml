<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1160">Statutory causes of action have been held not to be assignable because the right of recovery is restricted to the person entitled to the relief as described in the particular statutory provision. Claims involving ss 52, 82 and 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and s 420A of the Corporations Law (1999) (Controller's duty of care in exercising power of sale) and s 232 CA cannot be assigned ( Mijac Investments Pty Ltd v Graham (No.2) [2009] FCA 773 ; 72 ACSR 684 at [33] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 582">76 There have been further developments since McDougall J spoke. It has been contended that references to Trendtex in the High Court in Campbells Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostiff Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 , 229 CLR 386 favour a wider view of assignability. In my opinion the references made by Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ at paras [79]-[81] pp 431, 432 were not expressions of opinion on the authority of Trendtex or of Poulton . These observations do not clearly establish any authoritative position; any more than do the observations in Poulton . I was also referred to Scholle Industries Pty Ltd v AEP Industries (NZ) Ltd [2007] SASC 322 , 99 SASR 178 (White J) and Salfinger v New Guinea Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1532 (Heerey J) which show that a division of opinion continues. The review made in Mijac Investments Pty Ltd v Graham No. 2 [2009] FCA 773 (Gordon J) at 30-32 shows, to my mind, that this is not a well-settled field.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 87">The motions before the Court today are filed in an appeal from a judgment of a single judge of the Court. The judgment the subject of the appeal was given by Gordon J on 22 July 2009. Her Honour dismissed an application to the Court by the appellant, but made no order as to costs. In substance, her Honour found that there had been a failure to comply with the duties of a mortgagee in possession on the part of one or more of the respondents in selling the security. As a result of events that had occurred in the interim, however, her Honour found that it was not possible to grant any remedies to the appellant. See Mijac Investments Pty Ltd (ACN 084 820 280) v Graham (No 2) [2009] FCA 773. For the purposes of dealing with these motions, I am prepared to assume that the appellant has an arguable case in the appeal. </sentence>
