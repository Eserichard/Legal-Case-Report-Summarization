<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 74">2 The appeal is from a judgment of a single judge of the Court, published as Terry White Chemists Australia Fair v Secretary, Department of Health and Ageing [2008] FCA 1033. The appellant applied to the Court, pursuant to s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("the ADJR Act"), for review of the Secretary's decision. On 11 July 2008, the learned primary judge dismissed the application and ordered the appellant to pay the respondents' costs of the application. The case was conducted on the basis that there was no issue as to whether the appellant was a person aggrieved by the Secretary's decision, within the meaning of s 5 of the ADJR Act. At [12] of his Honour's reasons for judgment, the primary judge accepted that the appellant had appropriate standing. That conclusion has not been challenged on appeal.
