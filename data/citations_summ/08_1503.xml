<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1276">First, while there is authority that Courts have regarded the ascertainment of income as governed by the ordinary principles recognised or followed in business and commerce unless the legislature has itself made some specific provision affecting a particular matter or question ( Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v Executor Trustee and Agency Co of South Australia Ltd (1938) 63 CLR 108 at 152), it is also clear that Courts at the highest level in this country have recognised that, in appropriate circumstances, the concept of "income" for income tax purposes extends to include amounts that are not income according to ordinary concepts ( Resch v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1942] HCA 2 ; (1942) 66 CLR 198 at 210-211 per Rich J and 221-225 per Dixon J, and South Australia v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 7 ; (1992) 174 CLR 235 at 251). This principle has been applied in recent decisions in this Court (for example, Virgin Holdings SA v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1503 , Undershaft No 1 Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 41 ; [2009] 175 FCR 150).

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 In these two proceedings, that were heard together, taxpayers appeal against deemed appealable objection decisions of the respondent (Commissioner). As in the recent case of Virgin Holdings SA v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1503 ( Virgin Holdings ), a decision of Edmonds J given on 10 October 2008, the issue in each proceeding is whether income tax is not payable on the amount of a capital gain by reason of the operation of a Double Taxation Agreement (DTA). In Virgin Holdings the DTA was that between Australia and Switzerland. In the case of proceeding NSD 1283 of 2006 (the First Proceeding), in which Undershaft (No 1) Ltd (First Applicant) is the applicant, the DTA is between Australia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) (not the current DTA between those countries but an earlier one) (the UK Agreement).</sentence>
