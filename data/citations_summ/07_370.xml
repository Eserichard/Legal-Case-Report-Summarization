<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 937">The Federal Magistrate's decision, as appears from [16] of his reasons, was based on Lindgren J's reasons in Raikua v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 370 ; (2007) 158 FCR 510. There, it was held to be open to the Minister to decide not to consider exercising the power conferred by s 417 where, in the opinion of the assessing officer, the criteria in the guidelines have not been met or where it is "apparent to" or is "found" by the relevant officer that the criteria are not met. Justice Lindgren pointed out, at 522, that; 
 The Minister's decision not to consider exercising his power under s 417(1) in the particular case of the applicants comprises his decision just referred to operating upon the subjective judgment formed by Ms Connolly [an administrative officer within the Department]. There is no suggestion in the evidence that the Minister intended anything other than that provided the officer in good faith formed the view that the "unique" or "exceptional circumstances" criterion was not met, the Minister did not wish to consider exercising his s 417(1) power. The applicants do not suggest that Ms Connolly did not act in good faith.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] HCATrans 161">HER HONOUR: Against you the Minister relies on the reasoning which is contained in the judgment of Justice Lindgren in Raikua v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 370 ; (2007) 158 FCR 510 at 522, paragraph 64.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] HCATrans 58">It is said against you, Mr Wells, that some, I read the submissions as suggesting that all of the issues which you would seek to raise have been considered relatively recently in Raikua &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 370 ; (2007) 158 FCR 510 , a decision of Justice Lindgren.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 1451">
 It was submitted that the circumstances of that case were relevantly identical to the case before me although the applicant in NAOB of 2002 made a request for consideration under s.417 of the Migration Act . It has also been brought to my attention that Smith FM has also recently held that this Court does not have jurisdiction in relation to a decision of an officer not to refer a request under s.417 to the Minister due to the operation of sub-s.476(2)(d). In SZLJM v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 1945 , it was submitted that both Smith FM and Raphael FM relied on the reasoning in S1083 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1455 and Raikua &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 30 ; ; [2007] FCA 370 ; (2007) 158 FCR 510. Both the Court in S1083 of 2003 and Raikua considered earlier but similar provisions to the current sub-s.476(2)(d) and in each case it was held that the Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Whilst the Minister notes that the applicant placed importance on the fact that the Minister did not personally consider the exercise of the power which takes the action outside of the exclusion from jurisdiction set out in sub-s.4747(a) but all of the cases above were cases where there was a refusal by a departmental officer to refer a request to the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 904">In Raikula v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 370 ; 158 FCR 510 his Honour Lindgren J. examined the law in relation to the question of the reviewable aspects of the Minister's discretion under s.417. The conclusion reached is one which has been consistently reached by all my brother Federal Magistrates who have considered this issue and that is, this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain a review of the Minister's discretion under s.417. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 322"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 300">6 The Magistrate has referred to what his Honour described as " a long line of authority " addressing the jurisdiction to undertake the review then being urged upon that Court and correctly concluded that " the applicant has no arguable case for establishing jurisdiction in relation to the relief sought in this matter ". Included among those authorities was the review of the authorities undertaken by Lindgren J in Raikua v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 370 , 158 FCR 510. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 299">6 In the present Application it is considered that leave to appeal should be refused. The decision of the Federal Magistrate was correct. There is no relevant distinction between either ss 351 or 417 and no distinction between the present case and the decision in Raikua v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 370 , 158 FCR 510. It is considered that the application has no prospects of success for the reasons given in SZJLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 300. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 174"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FMCA 2146">He also sought to persuade me to reconsider the opinions I expressed in SZLJM. He submitted that I was in error in thinking that Raikua v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 370 ; (2007) 158 FCR 510 was relevantly indistinguishable on its relevant facts. I do not accept that submission. It is clear from [13] of Lindgren J's judgment that the administrative action which his Honour was addressing in Raikua was of the same nature as the administrative action in the present matter. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FMCA 2115">
 Both Smith FM and Raphael FM relied upon the reasoning in S1083/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [4] and Raikua v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [5] both of which considered earlier but similar provisions to s.476(2)(d).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2007] FMCA 1945">These cases arrive at the end of a long line of authority which has addressed previous jurisdictions of the Federal Court in relation to judicial review of decisions made by Ministers and their officers under s.417. The authorities were recently reviewed by Lindgren J in Raikua v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 370 ; (2007) 158 FCR 510. It is unnecessary for me to repeat his Honour's meticulous examination of the cases. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2007] FMCA 1874">The decision of Moore J in that matter is the latest on the current wording of the Act but the matter was also considered by Lindgren J in Raikua v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 370 (" Raikua ") where his Honour dealt with a similar application under the previous wording and came to the same view following an early decision of Moore J in S1083 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCA 1455.</sentence>
