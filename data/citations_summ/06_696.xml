<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 771">The rationale for the privilege is that an applicant must prove its own case and should not get any assistance from the respondent in proving its case. Hence, in the context of a crime, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Environment Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Pty Limited [1993] HCA 74 ; (1993) 178 CLR 477 observed at 532: 
 
 The privilege against self-incrimination confers an immunity which is deeply embedded in the law. In the end, it is based upon the deep-seated belief that those who allege the commission of a crime should prove it themselves and should not be able to compel the accused to provide proof against himself. (footnotes omitted) 
 

 
This statement also applies to the privilege against self-exposure to a penalty: Trade Practices Commission v Abbco Iceworks Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1279 ; (1994) 52 FCR 96 at 129 per Sheppard J; Lifetime Investments Pty Ltd v Commercial (Worldwide) Financial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 696 at [26] per Spender J; Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 at [31] , [2002] HCA 49 ; 213 CLR 543 at 559. The privilege can only be abrogated by statute or waived: Reid v Howard (1995) 184 CLR 1 at 12. See also: Refrigerated Express Lines (A/Asia) Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (1979) 42 FLR 204 ; Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1983) 152 CLR 328 at 336 to 339.  For the purposes of s 128(4) it was not considered in " the interests of justice " to " require " each of the individual Respondents to give evidence that may have tended to incriminate them. Evidence as to the conduct sought to be established was available from other sources. There remained what Spender J referred to as " the fundamental distaste of compulsion to disclose information ": Lifetime Investments Pty Ltd v Commercial (Worldwide) Financial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 696 at [33] . </sentence>
