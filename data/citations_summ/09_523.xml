<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 608">Whilst this submission was not advanced to any significant degree, the Court observes that in National Union of Workers v Coles CDC Eastern Creek Pty Limited [2009] FCA 523 Graham J considered a submission to the same effect. His Honour at [50] dismissed the fact that certain employees engaged at a particular location would not have a ' reasonable opportunity to decide ' because of their voting power. His Honour found such claim lacked any substance. </sentence>
