REASONS FOR DECISION 
(Delivered 11 March 2008)
Ms Sue Oliver SM: 1. This is an appeal from a decision of the Judicial Registrar made on 10 July 2007. The Judicial Registrar declined to make an order for security of costs against the first defendant on an application by the second and third defendants (&ldquo;the applicants&rdquo;). The applicants seek orders that the order of the Judicial Registrar be set aside, that the first defendant&rsquo;s claim and third party proceedings against the applicants be stayed until the first defendant provides security for costs as ordered by the Court, that the first defendant provide security for costs to the applicants by paying into Court the sum of $80,000 within seven days and that the first defendant pay the applicants&rsquo; costs of and incidental to the application before the Judicial Registrar and of this appeal, at 100% of the Supreme Court Scale. Pursuant to Local Court Rule 4.04 , such an appeal is by way of a hearing de novo.  19. That however does not conclude the matter. Once the threshold test has been met, I have an unfettered discretion as to whether in all the circumstances I should make an order for security for costs. See Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd v Football Federation Australia Ltd &amp; Soccer NSW Ltd [2006] FCA 1134 at [2] citing Reinsurance Australia Corporation Ltd v HIH Casualty &amp; General Insurance Ltd (in liq) [2003] FCA 803 at [66] &ndash; [67]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 163">4 The principles upon which an application such as the present should be determined are relatively clear cut, with one significant qualification which emerged from the submissions. Those principles are discussed in my earlier judgment: Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd v Football Federation Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 1134 at [2] .</sentence>
