<citphrase id="cp28.15" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">migration act 1958 (cth), ss 6 , 6a. in an application for review of a decision of the minister for immigration and ethnic affairs made in 1984 refusing an application for a permanent entry permit to an applicant who was the spouse of a permanent resident on the basis that the applicant's marriage had been assessed as being one where the parties did not genuinely intend to continue living as a married couple in australia, it being the minister's policy to refuse permanent entry permits in such cases.  held: (1) that relevant considerations which should have been taken into account were not, thus making the minister's decision invalid pursuant to s 5(2)(b) of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (the act), such considerations being:  (i) a report made in 1981 by an interviewing officer in suva expressing an opinion that the marriage relationship was genuine, such report being part of the history of the relationship, all of which was relevant in determining the quality of the marriage as at the date of the minister deciding the application. although the report was not presented to the minister, it was on the departmental file and was accordingly to be regarded as being constructively before him.  peko-wallsend ltd v. minister for aboriginal affairs (1985) 59 alr 51 , referred to.  (ii) statutory declarations of neighbours and acquaintances as to the applicant leading a normal married life and a letter of a social worker as to the applicant's wife living at home with the applicant, such documents being available to the minister, but there being nothing to indicate that he had taken any account of them.  (2) that in determining whether an administrative decision made under statutory authority falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp28.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 86">35 Both the Appellants and the Respondent filed detailed submissions as to the correct construction and application of the provisions found throughout Part XVB. These statutory provisions " are to be interpreted and applied, as far as the language permits, in accordance with Australia's international obligations " and " [a] broad approach to construction is to be adopted ": Schaefer Waste Technology Sdn Bhd v Chief Executive Officer, Australian Customs Service [2006] FCA 1644 at [48] to [49] [2006] FCA 1644 ; , 156 FCR 94 at 103 per Jacobson J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 837">The purpose of the anti-dumping measures, identified in s 269TG(2) is to address material injury and threatened material injury to the Australian industry producing like goods to those which are being sold at dumped prices in the Australian market, caused or likely to be caused by the dumping. That requires the decision-maker to have some objectively identified basis for concluding that the dumping has been, or is causing, or is threatening to cause, the relevant material injury after excluding the operation of any other cause of such injury or threat (s 269TAE(2A)). But, although a quantitative assessment is involved, the authorities have made clear that this is essentially a practical exercise and material injury to an industry may be identified even though precise quantification of the injury is not possible. What is material injury will depend on the circumstances of the particular case and may vary from industry to industry and from time to time: ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Fraser [1992] FCA 120 ; (1992) 34 FCR 564 at 577-578 per Black CJ, Neaves and von Doussa JJ; see too Swan Portland Cement Ltd v Minister for Small Business and Customs [1991] FCA 49 ; (1991) 28 FCR 135 at 144-145 per Lockhart J; Schaefer Waste Technology Sdn Bhd v Chief Executive Officer, Australian Customs Service ; [2006] FCA 1644 ; (2006) 156 FCR 94 at 115-116 [147] - [149] per Jacobson J and the authorities he collected there. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 838">The respondents contended that it was open to the CEO to make the finding in Report 137 that in that context it was likely that there would be price convergence between Siam's imports and Qenos' product. They argued that the test of causation of material injury was "essentially a practical exercise that had the purpose of achieving an objective of determining whether, viewed as a whole, the relevant Australian industry is suffering material injury from dumping", relying on what Lockhart J had said in Swan Portland Cement Ltd v Minister for Small Business and Customs (1991) 28 FCR 135 at 144; and Schaefer Waste Technology Sdn Bhd v Chief Executive Officer, Australian Customs Service [2006] FCA 1644 ; (2006) 156 FCR 94 at 115-116 [147] - [149] per Jacobson J.
