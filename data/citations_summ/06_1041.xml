<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 65">In Carver v de Robillard [2006] FCA 1041 , Lindgren J considered the question of personal service where the debtor had appeared before the Court in response to the process. But that is not the case in this instance. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 504">On the evidence before the court I am satisfied with service of the petition in accordance with the orders of 11 May 2010. Even if I were not so satisfied, I would regard any defect in service as a technical defect which could be cured under s.306 of the Act, as I am satisfied that the further amended creditor's petition and the documents attached to it actually came to Mr Lal's attention. Mr Lal filed a notice of opposition and affidavit in support on 4 June 2010 and attended the hearing on 5 July 2010. In these circumstances the debtor has suffered no prejudice by any deficiency in service of the further amended creditor's petition (see Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347 and Carver v de Robillard [2006] FCA 1041 and on appeal in de Robillard v Carver (2007) 159 FCR 38 ; [2007] FCAFC 73).

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 391">No objection relating to the service of these documents was taken by counsel at the directions hearings on 6 February 2008 and 7 March 2008: cf Carver v de Robillard [2006] FCA 1041 at [40] (per Lindgren J). Furthermore, service on solicitors on the record for Josef and Polina who both claim to have language difficulties, ensured that no injustice was done to them. It is clear that, certainly before 1 April 2008, the allegations against them and the evidence supporting those allegations were drawn to their attention in sufficient detail for them to provide the instructions which were necessary for the preparation of their affidavits. cf Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station (1985) 9 FCR 194 at 226 (per Toohey J). I am satisfied that the protective purposes, served by O 40 r 8, have been satisfied in respect of both Josef and Polina Vaysman insofar as service of the Amended Statement of Charge, the Notice of Motion and the supporting affidavits are concerned. Service and Knowledge of the 26 November 2007 Orders and the 27 November 2007 Orders
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 116">In that respect, (although this was not a matter raised by Mr Stewart), if service by placing the documents " under " the door rather than " affixing them to the front door " was, strictly speaking, a failure to serve the creditor's petition in accordance with the order for substituted service, such a technical defect can and should be cured under s.306 of the Bankruptcy Act as I am satisfied that the petition and supporting affidavits actually came to Mr Stewart's attention and were received by him. He has not suggested that he suffered any prejudice by any such deficiency in one of the methods specified for substituted service and nor is any such prejudice apparent (see Re Ditford; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347 ; 83 ALR 265 and see Carver v de Robillard (2006) 5 ABC(NS) 21 , [2006] FCA 1041 at [32] --- [42] per Lindgren J and note that on appeal the Full Court of the Federal Court agreed with this aspect of the decision although the appeal was allowed on other grounds, see de Robillard v Carver (2007) 159 FCR 38 ; [2007] FCAFC 73 at [81] --- [86]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 1323">Mr White referred to Skalkos v T&amp;S Recoveries Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 321 per Sundberg, Finkelstein and Hely JJ which held that reg.16.01 permits the service of Bankruptcy Notices in accordance with the regulation. Their Honours stated at [25]: [25]... If, on the proper construction of reg 16.01(2), the words "proof to the contrary" permit proof that the document was not delivered, there is no such proof in the present case. It is clear from Fancourt that proof of non-receipt as opposed to non-delivery is not permitted. If on the other hand those words only permit proof that the document was delivered on a date other than that on which it would have been delivered in the due course of post, there is no such proof.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 946">" 
 
 
 This rule was considered in some length in Carver v de Robillard [2006] FCA 1041 where Lindgren J opined that he did not consider the rule was inconsistent with rule 4.05 of the Bankruptcy Rules : 

"because I do not think that rule 4.05 of the Bankruptcy Rules excludes the possibility of waiver".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCAFC 73">3 On 11 August 2006, a judge of this Court made an order for the sequestration of the appellant's estate, finding that he had committed an act of bankruptcy on 7 December 2005 ( Carver v de Robillard [2006] FCA 1041). </sentence>
