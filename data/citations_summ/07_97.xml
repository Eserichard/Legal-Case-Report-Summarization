<citances>
<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1766">18 The plaintiffs submitted that:
 
(a) It is well established that the use of company funds to defend oppression proceedings may, in certain circumstances, constitute oppression (see Re DG Brims and Sons Pty Ltd (1995) 16 ACSR 559 at 591---592; Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd [1998] NSWSC 413 ; (1998) 28 ACSR 688 at 733; and Cassegrain v CTK Engineering Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 495 ; (2005) 54 ACSR 249 at [90] to [99] (pp 267---269); and Food Improvers Pty Ltd v BGR Corp Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 at [250] to [258]). (b) Where the issue has been raised prior to the final determination and there is a significant risk of the company's resources being expended in the defence of the interests of the majority, there is no reason why the Court would not step in at the interlocutory stage and make appropriate orders. In support of this submission, Counsel for the plaintiffs relied upon certain observations made by Brereton J in Grace v Grace (2007) 25 ACLC 141 ; [2007] NSWSC 6 at [52] and at [61] (second dot point). (c) The normal test for the grant of an interlocutory injunction applies in the circumstances of the present case;
 
(d) The plaintiffs have established a strong case that there is a serious question to be tried; and
 
(e) The balance of convenience favours the grant of an injunction because " ... there is a decidedly uneven playing field ... " in the sense that the plaintiffs are compelled to fund the litigation in circumstances where they have no assets of any significance whereas their protagonists, the Buskens, have access to company funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 617">11 On 12 February 2007 the primary Judge delivered reasons for judgment in proceedings NSD1140/2005: see The Food Improvers Pty Limited and Anor v BGR Corporation Pty Limited and Ors (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 ('the first reasons').
  27 His Honour also said at [12]:
 
 I also considered that it was appropriate to make an order that BGR actually pay to Food Improvers the consultancy fee of $500,000 plus GST. For the reasons that I gave in my principal judgment ([2007] FCA 97 at [269]- [271]) Triad should receive only a distribution of the proceeds of sale of Main Camp Plantation by way of a fully franked dividend, and should not be able to claim consultancy fees in the liquidation. Likewise, because Mr Bax said that, for its own reasons, Food Improvers wished to have its distribution made by payment of the consultancy fee (limited to $500,000 plus GST) together with the balance as a fully franked dividend, Food Improvers should not be able to make any claim further for consultancy fees in liquidation. For those reasons I made declarations that neither Food Improvers nor Triad had any subsisting entitlement to consultancy fees having regard to the adoption of option B in the resolution.  37 On 22 November 2007 the primary Judge delivered his written reasons in respect of the slip rule application: see The Food Improvers Pty Limited and Anor v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors (No 6) [2007] FCA 1812 ('the slip rule reasons'). In such reasons his Honour considered Options A and B and observed at [20]:
 
 By informally agreeing to distribution in accordance with Option B the parties were adopting a position that neither wished to assert their full legal rights to be paid under Option A... Since Mr Gulson was positively asserting there was no such entitlement, I found that he had indicated that he and Triad did not wish to receive those consultancy fees ( Food Improvers (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 at [269] ). That finding was inevitable given the joint rejection of distributing in accordance with Option A. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 413">

2 As I recorded in my reasons ( Food Improvers Pty Limited v BGR Corporation Pty Limited (No 4) [2007] FCA 220 at [1] ) which I gave following the earlier delivery of reasons for granting principal relief to the plaintiffs in Food Improvers Pty Limited v BGR Corporation Pty Limited (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 , I heard argument on 14 and 19 February 2007 on matters about which I had directed there be further submissions. On 19 February 2007, I made final orders on all but two of those matters. The first outstanding matter was to determine the proportion of costs that the second defendant (Triad Health Products Group of Companies Pty Limited) and the third defendant (Cordato Partners (Services) Pty Limited) should repay to BGR. During the proceedings, BGR had paid a large amount in respect of the costs of all the defendants. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1812">18 Thus, the compromise effected in Option B gave Triad a benefit of receiving after tax, fully franked dividends of about $0.5 million more cash than if it had charged BGR for the full amount of unrendered consultancy fees and interest. One thing is certain, under Option B BGR would not have retained a further $1.28 million in assets with which to pay any unrendered consultancy fees due to Triad once it had paid the proposed distributions and Food Improvers' $500,000 consultancy fee. And, if Triad were still owed consultancy fees not all of the dividends could have been declared and paid out of profits in accordance with Part 2H.5 and especially s 254T of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (see Food Improvers (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 at [176] ) without providing for payment of the $1.28 million liability if it existed: Industrial Equity Ltd v Blackburn [1977] HCA 59 ; (1977) 137 CLR 567 at 578-579 per Mason J with whom Stephen, Murphy and Aickin JJ agreed. 1 On 12 February 2007 I made orders by way of final relief and published my reasons for decision on the principal issues in the substantive proceedings: The Food Improvers Pty Ltd v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 97. Order 9 required the parties to file and serve written submissions as to the form of relief to be granted in respect of the distribution among its shareholders of the assets of the first defendant, BGR Corporation Pty Ltd. Those shareholders were The Food Improvers Pty Ltd (the first plaintiff), The Triad Health Products Group of Companies Pty Ltd (the second defendant) and Cordato Partners Services Pty Ltd (the third defendant). 20 In those circumstances, the parties came to the arrangement, which I found not to be legally enforceable, that they would proceed in accordance with Option B in distributing the net assets of BGR, following receipt of the proceeds of sale of Main Camp Station. That plan involved Food Improvers giving up any claim to anything over the $500,000. The distribution of the net proceeds of the sale of Main Camp was the only substantive source from which any of these fees could have been payable. I found that the parties were discussing the final distribution of BGR's net assets and undertaking after paying its liabilities ( Food Improvers (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 at [174] - [176]. By informally agreeing to distribution in accordance with Option B the parties were adopting a position that neither wished to assert their full legal rights to be paid under Option A. All would benefit: Mr Gulson's company, Triad, and Mr Cordato's company, Cordato Partners Services, each would receive a tax effective distribution better than under Option A. Mr Bax and Food Improvers would be willing to accept a slightly less tax-effective position but they would receive a benefit, from Mr Bax's point of view, by giving up the balance of claim for consultancy fees. Since Mr Gulson was positively asserting there was no such entitlement, I found that he had indicated that he and Triad did not wish to receive those consultancy fees ( Food Improvers (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 at [269] ). That finding was inevitable given the joint rejection of distributing in accordance with Option A. 17 In contrast, Option B followed the same steps but provided only for a $500,000 consultancy fee payment to Food Improvers alone. I explained in Food Improvers (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 at [170] - [174], that under Options A and B the after tax case position of the shareholders, assuming $6,345,000 was available in cash from the sale of Main Camp Station, cattle and stock, following payment of BGR's external liabilities, was as follows:
 Shareholding 
 ([2007] FCA 97 at [3])
 Option A Option B Food Improvers 24% $ 1.4m (25%) $ 1.35m (22%)
 Triad 68% $ 3.6m (65%) $ 4.1m (67%)
 Cordato Partners Services 8% $ 0.515m ( 9%) $ 0.7m (11%) 20 In those circumstances, the parties came to the arrangement, which I found not to be legally enforceable, that they would proceed in accordance with Option B in distributing the net assets of BGR, following receipt of the proceeds of sale of Main Camp Station. That plan involved Food Improvers giving up any claim to anything over the $500,000. The distribution of the net proceeds of the sale of Main Camp was the only substantive source from which any of these fees could have been payable. I found that the parties were discussing the final distribution of BGR's net assets and undertaking after paying its liabilities ( Food Improvers (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 at [174] - [176]. By informally agreeing to distribution in accordance with Option B the parties were adopting a position that neither wished to assert their full legal rights to be paid under Option A. All would benefit: Mr Gulson's company, Triad, and Mr Cordato's company, Cordato Partners Services, each would receive a tax effective distribution better than under Option A. Mr Bax and Food Improvers would be willing to accept a slightly less tax-effective position but they would receive a benefit, from Mr Bax's point of view, by giving up the balance of claim for consultancy fees. Since Mr Gulson was positively asserting there was no such entitlement, I found that he had indicated that he and Triad did not wish to receive those consultancy fees ( Food Improvers (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 at [269] ). That finding was inevitable given the joint rejection of distributing in accordance with Option A. 6 Triad argued that order 6 did not reflect the true intention of the Court, objectively ascertained, to give relief. The basis of the argument was that in my principal judgment given on 12 February 2007 ( Food Improvers (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 at [269] ) I held that each of Food Improvers and Triad was entitled to render invoices so as to be paid over a million dollars each in consultancy fees which they had not then invoiced. That finding had been made in a context that I had described in some detail earlier in those reasons. Triad now argues that the effect of that finding in the principal judgment was that:
 
 
 &#8226; Triad was owed a debt of over a million dollars for consultancy fees by BGR;
 &#8226; all parties to the proceedings were bound by that finding; and
 &#8226; the finding limited the orders which could be made to provide relief to the plaintiffs.  15 Options A and B were presented by Mr Bax to the meeting with Mr Lombardo to which I referred to in my principal judgment ( Food Improvers [2007] FCA 97 at [162] - [180]). The scheme of Options A and B was to distribute BGR's net assets after receipt of the proceeds of sale of Main Camp Station. Each first provided for the payment of external creditors of BGR. Option A was designed to reflect what Food Improvers and Mr Bax were asserting was the legal position, namely that each of Food Improvers and Triad were entitled to claim all of the consultancy fees under their consultancy agreements for the period in which payments had been suspended. The plaintiffs had claimed over a million dollars for consultancy fees in the proceedings well before the meeting with Mr Lombardo. Triad and Mr Gulson were asserting, with Cordato Partners Services' and Mr Cordado's support at that time, that no consultancy fees were payable during that period. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 466">2 Earlier I had found that by causing BGR to pay their legal costs associated with the proceedings, Triad and Cordato Partners Services had acted oppressively to Food Improvers (see order 3(a) made on 12 February 2007: The Food Improvers Pty Ltd v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 97). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 220">1 Following delivery of my reasons for granting principal relief to the plaintiffs ( The Food Improvers Pty Limited v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 97) , I heard argument on 14 and 19 February 2007 as to matters on which I had directed there be further submissions. I then made final orders on all but two questions, namely:
 
 
 &#8226; the proportion of the costs of the defendants which Triad and Cordato Partners Services should bear;
 &#8226; the plaintiffs' motion for an order for costs on an indemnity basis. 
 

These are my reasons for the orders made on 19 February 2007 and on the outstanding two questions.
  13 In my principal judgment ([2007] FCA 97 at [280]), I referred to a submission made by the plaintiffs for an order vacating the order for costs made by Hely J on 22 July 2005 when refusing interlocutory relief. No submission was made and I did not then appreciate that his Honour's order had been made by consent. No basis has been shown to set aside the consent order. The contract between the parties embodied in the making of the consent order can be set aside, as any other contract can be, on ordinary principles of common law or equity for setting aside agreements and, also, in exceptional circumstances: Paino v Hofbauer (1988) 13 NSWLR 193 at 198C-F per McHugh JA (Samuels JA agreeing), 200B-F per Clarke JA; Harvey v Phillips [1956] HCA 27 ; (1956) 95 CLR 235 at 243-244 per Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ. There was no evidence before me warranting the making of any such order setting aside the consent orders. I had proceeded on the above misapprehension in making the observations made of that judgment that Hely J had made the order in the exercise of his discretion. There was no occasion to reopen that order and I refused to do so.
  27 In my principal judgment, I referred to the positions of the parties during the negotiations ([2007] FCA 97 at [182]-[198]). However, not all the detail of the negotiations between the parties was in evidence. In its original form cl 7(c) of the offer (in the draft deed of 7 October 2005) contemplated that if the deed were not completed or were otherwise breached, the plaintiffs had the option of continuing or recommencing the proceedings. The final version of the draft deed in evidence was sent by Haywards to Cordato Partners on 23 November 2005. It incorporated a number of the latter's suggested amendments (4/1019, 1023). That draft deed also had a provision in cl 7(c) that if the contemplated sale of the assets or the distribution proposed in accordance with option B were not completed or if the agreement were breached by the defendants, then the plaintiffs would be at liberty to continue or recommence proceedings against the defendants.  18 I reject those submissions. I found that Food Improvers was entitled to claim its consultancy fees in full but that, in the exercise of my discretion under s 233 of the Act, the appropriate way of remedying the oppression which I found was to limit Food Improvers' entitlement to what it had sought under option B and to distribute the balance by way of fully franked dividends ([2007] FCA 97 at [269]-[270]). While I rejected the different claims made by each side that some contract had been made for the distribution of the funds realised by the sale of Main Camp Plantation, not much time was taken in the hearing on that question. Rather, the focus was on the conduct of the defendants in the negotiations leading to and following the development of option B and their apparent acceptance of it as the method of distribution until 22 February 2006. However, a distribution was made which was not in accordance with option B. 
  29 By 5 January 2006 the contract for sale of Main Camp Plantation had been entered into but not completed. On that day Haywards wrote to Cordato Partners discussing the proposed deed. They noted that given the history between their respective clients, the plaintiffs were not prepared to withdraw from these proceedings until the sale of the property had been completed and the monies distributed in accordance with the agreement. Shortly afterwards on 11 January 2006 Cordato Partners advised Haywards that there were no longer any settlement discussions on foot but that the distribution of the proceeds of sale of the Main Camp Plantation would proceed in accordance with option B ([2007] FCA 97 at [185]). On the same day Cordato Partners wrote a without prejudice letter to Haywards noting that there remained a number of areas of disagreement, most fundamentally, the fact that the plaintiffs were not prepared to enter into an agreement which set out the future matters to be attended to, but rather desired, so they said, 'to keep the proceedings on foot like the "sword of Damocles" until all matters are resolved to [the plaintiffs'] satisfaction'.  12 I also made an order, consequential upon the resolution which I ordered, for Triad to pay $340,000 and for Cordato Partners Services to pay $40,000 to BGR. These were the amounts overpaid to them under the resolution of BGR's directors of 22 February 2006 which I set aside. I also considered that it was appropriate to make an order that BGR actually pay to Food Improvers the consultancy fee of $500,000 plus GST. For the reasons that I gave in my principal judgment ([2007] FCA 97 at [269]-[271]) Triad should receive only a distribution of the proceeds of sale of Main Camp Plantation by way of a fully franked dividend, and should not be able to claim consultancy fees in the liquidation. Likewise, because Mr Bax said that, for its own reasons, Food Improvers wished to have its distribution made by payment of the consultancy fee (limited to $500,000 plus GST) together with the balance as a fully franked dividend, Food Improvers should not be able to make any claim further for consultancy fees in liquidation. For those reasons I made declarations that neither Food Improvers nor Triad had any subsisting entitlement to consultancy fees having regard to the adoption of option B in the resolution.
  22 In light of the way in which the proceedings were conducted and argued before me, I am of opinion that the substantial part of the proceedings involved a vigorous dispute between the shareholders of BGR. The shareholders had agreed to conduct through a corporate vehicle (BGR) the quasi partnership which I found to exist. Necessarily, when the partnership foundered and the intervention of the Court became necessary to resolve the differences between the parties, the corporation had some involvement. But the principal resistance was made to relief which, to my mind, must have been inevitable when the relationship between Mr Bax and Mr Gulson broke down on the night of 29 May 2005. That claim was for the orderly winding up of the affairs of BGR and its group. Mr Cordato recognised as much in his email of 30 May 2005. There, he correctly identified that if the directors were divided the enterprise had to be sold while it had enterprise value ([2007] FCA 97 at [97]). The shareholder dispute escalated and caused considerable expense after that. The orderly winding up necessarily involved compensating the consultants for their services pursuant to the agreement made in March 2001 when consultancy fees ceased to be rendered or paid. 20 Counsel for the plaintiffs accepted that the claim for an injunction against Mr Cordato made in the plaintiffs' notice of motion filed on 31 March 2006 was somewhat confusingly referred to at the final hearing and in submissions. They pointed out, as referred to in the principal judgment ([2007] FCA 97 at [263]), that Haywards' letter of 15 May 2006 indicated that that order was no longer being sought. Nonetheless, counsel for the plaintiffs acknowledged that their reliance, in their final submissions, on the inherent jurisdiction of the Court being available to deal with Mr Cordato's continuing to act could have created some confusion.
