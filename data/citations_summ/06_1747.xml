<citphrase id="cp3.0" type=citing from="[2008] AATA 1094">a stay order does not set aside the original decision. that decision remains in place. as emmett j explained in duncan v companies auditors liquidators disciplinary board [2006] fca 1747 at [11] , the stay order is directed to the operation or implementation of the decision under review. there is no question we have the power to direct that the implementation and operation of the decision to disqualify mr quinlivan can be stayed pursuant to s 41(2). once that order is made, the applicant is free to continue acting as a director subject to the terms of the stay order. there is also no doubt following the decision in duncan that the stay power permits us to direct that asic refrain from completing the other formal steps required under the corporations act 2001 and the australian securities and investments commission act 2001 (the "asic act") following a disqualification order. those steps include noting the fact of the order on the register maintained under the act. the question in this case is whether our power permits us to restrain asic from issuing press releases and otherwise publicising or discussing the original decision. asic says we do not have the power, and that we should not exercise it if we do. mr derrington sc, for asic, pointed out that duncan did not directly address the power to make an order in the terms sought. his honour's reasons focus on the power to make an order restraining the regulator from issuing the formal notifications required under the statute. mr savage sc, for the applicant, says the orders in duncan</citphrase>

<citphrase id="cp3.2" type=citing from="[2008] AATA 1094">can only make sense if his honour at least implicitly accepted the power under s 41(2) permitted the tribunal to restrain the regulator from publicising the decision more generally. we acknowledge that the wording of the orders in duncan creates a degree of ambiguity about his honour's intentions, but we are satisfied the reasoning does not directly address the issue before us. we were also referred to the decision of deputy president forgie in ptlz and australian securities and investments commission [2008] aata 106. asic decided to ban the applicant from providing financial services. the applicant sought a stay pursuant to s 41(2). he also sought an order restraining asic from publicising the decision prior to the hearing. the application for a non-publication order was made under ss 35 and 41(2). dp forgie considered the decision in duncan and other authorities and concluded the tribunal did have the power under s 41(2) to make the orders sought. she directed that the applicant be identified by a pseudonym and restrained asic from issuing press releases. dp forgie considered (at [81]ff) whether asic provided information to the public in fulfilment of a statutory duty. in the event, she decided that s 1(2)(f) of the asic act was not the source of asic's duty to issue press releases. she speculated that the source of the power might lie in s 11(4) of the asic act although she did not decide the question because she held she did not need to do so. she explained (at [90]):</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 185">7 It is, in relation to the notice and the register, unnecessary to consider whether the power to make the order also flowed from the expression "[the] implementation of the decision" in s 41(2). However, for completeness, I should indicate that I doubt this is so. The meaning of the word "implementation" is not simply to be derived, as Emmett J suggested in Duncan v Companies Auditors Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2006] FCA 1747 ; (2006) 155 FCR 572 at [11] , from the ordinary meaning of the word revealed by dictionaries. That is because, in my opinion, the word is intended to pick up the corresponding expression in the preceding subsection which provides:
 (1) Subject to this section, the making of an application to the Tribunal for a review of a decision does not affect the operation of the decision or prevent the taking of action to implement the decision. (Emphasis added) 
While the defined meanings referred to by his Honour are probably, in substance, no different from the expression "the taking of action to implement the decision", it is nonetheless that expression which identifies the subject matter of the power conferred by subsection (2). In the present case, as I noted earlier, it is unnecessary for a decision maker who makes a banning order to do anything to implement the decision. No action needs to be taken. It is the Corporations Act which establishes legal consequences of the decision and, in that way, implements it. The decision is, in this sense, self executing. 42 ASIC's second proposition builds upon its first. It is that if ASIC must fulfil its statutory duties to publish the fact of the making of a banning order irrespective of the outcome of the AAT's review, it must also follow that an exercise of power under s 41(2) of the AAT Act purporting to prevent ASIC from discharging its statutory duties under ss 920E(2) and 922A (1) of the Corporations Act can never be "for the purpose of securing the effectiveness of the hearing and determination of the application for review". That is, according to ASIC, its obligation to publish is simply unaffected by the AAT's review powers. On ASIC's case the observation in Duncan v Companies Auditors Liquidators Disciplinary Board (2006) 155 FCR 572 ; [2006] FCA 1747 at [12] about analogous obligations to publish existing "only for so long as the decision continued to have effect" is incorrect. ASIC submitted that the reasoning in Allied Asia Holdings (Aust) Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2002] FCA 566 at [16] (that the AAT has power to make an order affecting the operation or implementation of the decision only and not the fact that the decision has been made) is to be preferred. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 669">The question then arises as to what form the stay should take. Section 41(2) of the AAT Act empowers the Tribunal to "make such order or orders staying or otherwise affecting the operation or implementation of the decision as the Tribunal considers appropriate". In Duncan v Companies Auditors Liquidators Disciplinary Board &amp; Ors (2006) 155 FCR 572 ; (2006) 61 ACSR 47 ; (2006) 93 ALD 401 ; (2006) 44 AAR 253 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 1621 ; [2006] FCA 1747 at [9] , Emmett J recognised that the power to stay is to stay the operation or implementation of the decision and not to suspend or stay the decision itself. He noted the ordinary meaning of "operation" being the way in which a thing works, or the act, use or manner of operating. By contrast, "implementation" involves the execution or putting into effect of, in this instance, a decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] AATA 1094">A stay order does not set aside the original decision. That decision remains in place. As Emmett J explained in Duncan v Companies Auditors Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2006] FCA 1747 at [11] , the stay order is directed to the operation or implementation of the decision under review. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 106">It did so in Duncan v Companies Auditors Liquidators Disciplinary Board [5] but, it was submitted, that case does not support a conclusion that the power under s 41 may be used in a situation in which ASIC has already issued a media release. " [64] 
 
 
55. " [81] 
 
 
65. It is a proposition found in the judgment of Emmett J in Duncan v Companies Auditors Liquidators Disciplinary Board [62] and of Heerey J in the earlier case of Allied Asia Holdings (Aust) Pty Ltd v Australian Securities Investments Commission . [65] It is instead a power " staying or otherwise affecting the operation or implementation of the decision " (emphasis added). It also means the state of being operative, or the act, process or manner of operating ... On the other hand, ' implementation' involves completion or execution, fulfilment or putting into effect ... " [73] 
 
 
62. The reasoning of the Federal Court in Duncan v Companies Auditors Liquidators Disciplinary Board [4] is, it was submitted, limited to using the power given by s 35(2) to stay the need for a body to comply with legislative requirements that would otherwise need to be complied with in certain time frames.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] AATA 1779">Although Emmett J made no reference to Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Hotop when he decided Duncan v Companies Auditors Liquidators Disciplinary Board , [81] his reasoning and conclusion are consistent with the earlier case.</sentence>
