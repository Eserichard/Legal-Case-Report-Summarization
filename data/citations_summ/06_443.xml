<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 135">Rule 7.01(1) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth) [22] empowers the Court, at any stage in a proceeding, to allow or direct a party to amend a document (other than an affidavit). The Court made the following observations on r.7.01 of the FMCA Rules in Fair Work Ombudsman v Nerd Group Australia Pty Ltd : [23] ... The power given to the Court under r.7.01(1) of the FMCA Rules has been described as one which is "extensive", [24] a "general power", [25] and one upon which there is "no qualification". [26] The power under r.7.01(1) of the FMC Rules is a power capable of exercise at any stage of proceedings, although earlier is better than later. [27] It is not however a power to be used to substitute an applicant for an existing applicant who lacked standing to bring the proceedings originally. [28] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 569">The terms of r.7.01(1) of the FMC Rules are set out above.

[18] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 736">As to whether leave to amend should be granted, Mr Batley submitted that the power to amend, in this case an application, is provided by Rule 7.01 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules . There is no qualification on the rule and the ultimate consideration is the interests of justice ( SZGTE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [22] at [34]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FMCA 1181">It was noted that the dictates of justice are the paramount consideration (see SZGTE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (2006) FCA 443 per Graham J at [34]).</sentence>
