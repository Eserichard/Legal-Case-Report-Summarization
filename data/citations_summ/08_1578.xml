<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 115">13 The power of the Court to suppress the publication of " particular evidence, or the name of a party or witness " cannot be questioned: Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 50. That power has been exercised to suppress the names of parties to litigation (e.g., E v Australian Red Cross Society [1991] FCA 20 ; (1991) 27 FCR 310 at 313 to 314 per Wilcox J) and the names of those persons involved in litigation (e.g., Re Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1578). The mere fact that a party may claim " embarrassment or unfortunate financial effects ", however, may not be a sufficient foundation for an order (e.g., Catena v Australian Securities and Investment Commission [2010] FCA 598 at [22] to [24] per Barker J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 598">Suppression orders, so called, are sometimes issued by courts so that any concurrent or associated criminal proceedings are not prejudiced. However, that is not this case. A case such as the present will only result in a suppression order being granted where it can be shown that the interests of justice will really be put at risk. Mere embarrassment or unfortunate financial effects on an appellant or their dependants or other persons are usually not sufficient: see John Fairfax v Local Court (1991) 26 NSWLR 131 at 142; Re Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1578 at [11] . In essence, these are the complaints of the applicant. He is concerned about the effect publication of the AAT decision will have on his future prospects to resume in his industry. This is not a sufficient reason for the Court to grant the confidentiality orders sought. </sentence>
