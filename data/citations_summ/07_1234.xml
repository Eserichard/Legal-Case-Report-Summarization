<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 325">The second is found in the judgment of Lindgren J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Wellnora Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1234 ; [2007] FCA 1234 ; (2007) 163 FCR 232 at [217] - [218]: 
 
"The question of the considerations that are relevant to a company administrator's exercise of a casting vote under reg 5.6.21 and of applications under s 600B to set aside a resolution passed on the casting vote has been considered in Re Bartlett Researched Securities Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (1994) 12 ACSR 707 (Bartlett) , Re Coaleen Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) [1999] QSC 18 ; (1999) 30 ACSR 200 (Coaleen) , Re Martco Engineering Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) ; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Martco Engineering Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 702 ; (1999) 32 ACSR 487 ; Cresvale Far East Ltd (in liq) v Cresvale Securities Ltd [2001] NSWSC 89 ; (2001) 37 ACSR 394 (Cresvale) , Young v Sherman [2002] NSWCA 281 ; (2002) 170 FLR 86 , and Blue Ring Pty Ltd v Landshore Pty Ltd (Subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement) [2006] WASC 245 (Blue Ring). These authorities show that: 
 
(1) Good faith alone will not necessarily shield the resolution from a setting aside (or variation) under s 600B ( Cresvale [2001] NSWSC 89 ; 37 ACSR 394 at [111] ); 
 
(2) A factor that may justify setting aside the resolution is a statement in or omission from the administrator's report under s 439A that is apt to have misled creditors when they cast their deliberative vote ( Blue Ring [2006] WASC 245) ; 
 
(3) Inadequacy and superficiality of an administrator's investigation of the company's business, property, affairs and financial circumstances, at least as disclosed by the evidence before the Court, may warrant a setting aside of the resolution ( Bartlett 12 ACSR 707 ; Cresvale [2001] NSWSC 89 ; 37 ACSR 394 at [113] ); 
 
(4) There is no presumption in favour of the majority in value, although any large disproportion between the values of the debts of the numerical minority and the numerical majority will be a factor to be taken into account ( Coaleen [1999] QSC 18 ; 30 ACSR 200 ; Cresvale [2001] NSWSC 89 ; 37 ACSR 394 at [115] ); and 
 
(5) Payment of a premium to the creditors who supported the DOCA but not to a dissident creditor will justify a setting aside by the court ( Young v Sherman [2002] NSWCA 281 ; 170 FLR 86). "

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 178">In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Wellnora Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1234 ; (2007) 163 FCR 232 , Lindgren J concluded (at [198]) that, on the basis of a number of provisions of Part 5.3A , an administrator was required to act with expedition within a tight timeframe, which should be extended or adjourned only exceptionally. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWSC 541">105 An order under s 600A(2)(a) setting aside the deed of company arrangement will not, of itself, put an end to the deed of company arrangement: see s 600E. To that extent, it will not be a complete answer to the relevant prejudice. But, as Lindgren J observed in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Wellnora Pty Ltd (2007) 163 FCR 232 ; [2007] FCA 1234 , a case involving the analogous provisions of s 600B , it is open to the court also to make such other orders as it thinks necessary (s 600A(2)(d)) , including an order setting aside the relevant deed of company arrangement where the resolution in question is a resolution that such a deed be executed. His Honour also noted the capacity of s 447A to support such an ancillary order. I quote paragraph [180] of the judgment:
 

 
 
 " Section 600B(3) empowers the Court, if it sets aside the resolution, to make such further orders, and give such directions, as it thinks necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 626">The principles relevant to the exercise of a casting vote have been considered in a number of cases: see eg Re Bartlett Researched Securities Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (1994) 12 ACSR 707 , Re Coaleen Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) [1999] QSC 18 ; (1999) 30 ACSR 200 , Re Martco Engineering Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed); Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Martco Engineering Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 702 ; (1999) 32 ACSR 487 , Cresvale Far East Ltd (in liq) v Cresvale Securities Ltd [2001] NSWSC 89 ; (2001) 37 ACSR 394 , Young v Sherman [2002] NSWCA 281 ; (2002) 170 FLR 86 , Blue Ring Pty Ltd v Landshore Pty Ltd (subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement) [2006] WASC 245 and Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Wellnora Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1234 ; [2007] FCA 1234 ; (2007) 163 FCR 232 at [214] --- [219]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] NSWSC 483">15 The circumstances in which the Creditors Fund was eventually constituted were examined by Lindgren J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Wellnora Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1234 ; (2007) 163 FCR 232. His Honour concluded that, although there had been some irregularities, the sum of $65,000 was provided by Ms Soong and the Creditors Fund was created. Lindgren J also concluded, however, that distribution of the Creditors Fund was completed on 21 June 2006. As a result, his Honour held (at [173]), the deed of company arrangement terminated on that date by operation of s 445(c) of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 1542">1 I published Reasons for Judgment on 15 August 2007 in this proceeding and in proceeding NSD 2335 of 2005 (Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Wellnora Pty Limited (subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement)) ( Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Wellnora Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1234). The only orders then made were for the filing of submissions and the listing of the proceeding for oral elaboration on those submissions.</sentence>
