<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 601">But the power to dismiss an appeal for want of prosecution is a power available to be exercised in an appropriate case. " [S]uccessive and cavalier omissions by the appellant " led the Full Court to dismiss an appeal in NBCI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 280. So, too, can " persistent breach of the Court's directions ": Khera v Jones [2008] FCA 548 at [16] per Buchanan J. This power can be invoked in respect to all appeals, including bankruptcy appeals: e.g. Singh v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2008] FCA 544. </sentence>
