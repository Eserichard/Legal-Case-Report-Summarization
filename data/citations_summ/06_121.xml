<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1258">29 The sufficiency of a patent has been described as "a pure question of fact in respect of which there may be discovery": Conor Medsystems Inc v University of British Columbia (No 3) [2006] FCA 121 ; (2006) 228 ALR 515 at [4] .
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] NSWSC 432">25 In the ordinary course, if one party can point to good reason to think that discovery is incomplete after the other party purports to have completed it, the appropriate course is to ask the court to order further discovery: British Association of Glass Bottle Manufacturers Ltd v Nettlefold [1912] AC 709. Where the suspicion as to insufficiency relates to a particular document or class or description of documents, the order sought may appropriately be an order for particular discovery: see, for example, Conor Medsystems Inc v The University of British Columbia (No 3) [2006] FCA 121. </sentence>
