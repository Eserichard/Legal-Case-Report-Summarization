(1) where an employer submitted to union pressure to dismiss a non-striker, there was little likelihood that the dismissal would be actuated by the reason actuating the union: the reason actuating the dismissal would be the placation of the union and this did not constitute a contravention of s. 5 (1) (aa).</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 788">It is not a requirement before an interest can arise in equity on the principles of proprietary or promissory estoppel that the interest be defined in terms sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract ( Pacific National (ACT) Limited v Queensland Rail [2006] FCA 91 at [668] ; Greek Macedonian Club Limited v Pan Macedonian Greek Brotherhood NSW Limited at [52] and cases there cited; Hoath v Connect Internet Services Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 158 ; (2006) 229 ALR 566 at [200] ). If need be the terms of the easement can be settled by the court ( EK Nominees Pty Ltd v Woolworths Limited [2006] NSWSC 1172 at [269] - [275]). The terms of the easement to be granted over the new route shown as " Right of Way Extension to Warkworth " should follow the terms of the 1915 transfer, thereby incorporating Wambo's right reasonably to redefine the route, provided that in doing so access is provided to a road leading to Warkworth. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] VSC 140">[11] Indeed in Svenson v Payne [12] the High Court approved observations made in earlier cases to the effect that a person is not to be deprived of his legal rights by estoppel "unless he [sic] has acted in such a way as to make it fraudulent in the equitable sense for him to set up those rights" and that "the party setting up the estoppel must prove the case by strong and cogent evidence".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 658">In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 ; (2009) 253 ALR 324 at [113] Foster J noted that there is authority in this Court which establishes the following propositions concerning the operation of s 51AC: 
 
 (a) The scope of s 51AC is wider than that of s 51AA. The meaning of unconscionable for the purposes of s 51AC is not limited to the meaning of the word according to established principles of common law and equity: per French J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) (2000) 96 FCR 491 ; 169 ALR 324 ; [2000] FCA 2 at [24] and [25], per Sundberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Ltd (2000) 104 FCR 253 ; 178 ALR 304 ; [2000] FCA 1365 at [31] , per Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd (2003) 200 ALR 491 ; 59 IPR 435 ; [2003] FCA 850 at [183] and per Jacobson J in Pacific National (ACT) Ltd v Queensland Rail (2006) 28 ATPR (Digest) 46-268 ; [2006] FCA 91 at [918] and [931]. (b) The ordinary or dictionary meaning of unconscionable , which involves notions of serious misconduct or something which is clearly unfair or unreasonable, is picked up by the use of the word in s 51AC. When used in that section, the expression requires that the actions of the alleged contravenor show no regard for conscience, and be irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable. Inevitably the expression imports a pejorative moral judgment: per Heerey, Drummond and Emmett JJ in Hurley v McDonalds Australia Ltd (2000) ATPR 41-741 ; [1999] FCA 1728 at [22] and 29. This helpful articulation of the meaning of the word when used in s 51AC was followed by Selway J in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd (2003) 200 ALR 491 ; 59 IPR 435 ; [2003] FCA 850 at [183] ---[185] ( 4WD Systems ) and by Sundberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Ltd (2000) 104 FCR 253 ; 178 ALR 304 ; [2000] FCA 1365 at [30] ; and
 (c) Normally, some moral fault or moral responsibility would be involved. This would not ordinarily be present if the critical actions are merely negligent. There would ordinarily need to be a deliberate (in the sense of intentional) act or at least a reckless act: per Selway J in 4WD Systems at [185].

 i. the alleged conventions in paragraphs C41, C41A and C41B all involve statements as to intended future conduct. They relate to what the parties will do in the future. However, conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters: see Pacific National (ACT) Ltd v Queensland Rail (2006) ATPR (Digest) 46-268 ; [2006] FCA 91 at [668] . ii. no estoppel by convention could arise from pre-contractual conduct because of the "entire agreement" provision in clause 44.6 of the WPD: see e.g. 63 The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: see e.g. Pacific National (ACT) Ltd v Queensland Rail (2006) ATPR (Digest) 46-268 ; [2006] FCA 91 at [668] (and the cases there cited). However, conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters: see Pacific National (ACT) Ltd v Queensland Rail (2006) ATPR (Digest) 46-268 ; [2006] FCA 91 at [668] .  63 The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: see e.g. Pacific National (ACT) Ltd v Queensland Rail (2006) ATPR (Digest) 46-268 ; [2006] FCA 91 at [668] (and the cases there cited).

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] NSWSC 1172">269 A lack of definition of the interest which the plaintiff was induced to assume it would acquire in the defendant's property may not be a bar to the grant of equitable relief on the principles of proprietary estoppel ( Ramsden v Dyson per Lord Kingsdown at 170-171; Plimmer v The Mayor of Wellington ; Inwoods v Baker [1965] EWCA Civ 4 ; [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37; Holiday Inns Inc v Broadhead ; Austotel v Franklins ). As Jacobson J said in Pacific National (ACT) Ltd v Queensland Rail [2006] FCA 91 (at [668]):

" (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713---714, Inwards v Baker [1965] EWCA Civ 4 ; [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607---610 per Priestley JA. 

 (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585---586 per Kirby JA and at 620---621 per Rogers AJA.

 Poort v Development Underwriting (Victoria) Pty Ltd (No. 2) [1977] VicRp 52 ; [1977] VR 454 
 Shuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd [1973] UKHL 2 ; [1974] AC 235 
 
CONTRACT --- repudiation --- persistent and pervasive disregard of contractual provisions --- inference contracting party not prepared to take primary obligations seriously --- promisee unaware of conduct. 412 There have been a number of attempts made to formulate the requirements for an equitable estoppel in circumstances such as these. Recently, Jacobson, J has attempted to catalogue and summarise the principles applicable in Pacific National (ACT) Limited v Queensland Rail . [14] Such attempts inevitably have shortcomings, but Jacobson, J's catalogue is useful, and satisfactorily summarises the applicable principles for the purposes of this proceeding in my view. </sentence>
