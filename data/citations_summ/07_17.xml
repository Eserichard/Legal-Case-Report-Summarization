<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 770">11 The argument that that other purpose (that is the first purpose at paragraph [4] above) was not a "proper purpose" is not based on any view that a meeting of members is not competent to install new directors (see paragraph [7] above). That this is, in the abstract, a "proper purpose" for s 249Q purposes was explicitly recognised in Reefton Mining NL v Kimbriki Nominees Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 17 ; (2007) 61 ACSR 72. The argument that it was, in the particular context, not "proper" was advanced by reference to a number of factual matters to which it is now necessary to turn as a preliminary to considering the scope and effect of s 249Q of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
