<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCAfam 949">Four other very recent cases may be noted briefly. First, in TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd , [57] Sundberg J, of the Federal Court of Australia, helpfully summarised what he described as principles in anti-suit injunctions and stay applications in the following terms: [58] [56] The following principles can be derived from decisions of the High Court in Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay (1988) 165 CLR 197 ; [1988] HCA 32 ; 79 ALR 9 ; Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 ; 97 ALR 124 and CSR Ltd v Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd (1997) 189 CLR 345 ; 146 ALR 402 ; [1997] HCA 33: (a) Where an anti-suit injunction is sought in an Australian court in relation to proceedings in another country, the court should first consider whether it is appropriate for it to determine the matter in issue before deciding whether to grant the injunction. (b) A stay is only granted if the Australian court is a clearly inappropriate forum. (c) The onus is on the party seeking a stay to satisfy the court that the continuation of the case would be oppressive or vexatious to the party having regard to the existence an appropriate tribunal in another country. In the light of the factual and legal issues to which I have briefly, albeit generally, referred, these proceedings may be seen to concern the operation of s.114 of the Family Law Act 1975 ("the Act") in relation to the alleged Indian dowry and possible criminal proceedings in India in relation to it. The facts described below, and the relief sought, raise issues concerning the application of well-established principles in relation to --- (as sought by the Wife, among other things), a permanent stay of the proceedings on the ground that they are being conducted in this Court, which (it is said) is a "clearly inappropriate forum", as opposed to the criminal courts in India; [1] (as sought by the Husband) an anti-suit injunction against the wife to prevent any proceedings being brought in India, an anti-suit injunction. [2] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 194">54 In my view, none of the grounds in the preceding paragraph can be established. First, there is no evidence and no submission that the Illinois proceedings have interfered or will interfere with the Australian proceedings; indeed, the Illinois Court declined to issue an anti-suit injunction restraining the appellant's prosecution of this application for leave to appeal. (Although the presiding judge makes reference to National Mutual , there is no discussion of how this Court's processes are threatened, if at all. ) Secondly, the primary judge rejected the submission of the appellant that the respondents' purpose in instituting the Illinois proceedings was to prevent the appellant from pursuing the Australian proceedings: [2008] FCA 1110 at [77] . That finding was not challenged by the appellant before this Court. In fact, before this Court all parties accepted that the only court equipped to vindicate the respondents' claims of infringement said to have occurred in the US would be a US Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1329">1 The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the judgment and orders of Sundberg J on 30 July 2008: TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1110. The issue before me is not the substantive question of leave, but whether the application for leave should be heard by a single judge or by the Full Court. Order 52 r 2AA creates a presumption in favour of hearing such applications by a single judge. Relevantly it provides:
 An application mentioned in subsection 25(2) of the [Federal Court of Australia] Act must be heard and determined by a single Judge unless: 
 
 
 (a) a judge directs that the application be heard and determined by a Full Court</sentence>
