<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 278">In CSBP Ltd v Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union of Workers (2007) 162 IR 81 ; [2007] FCA 539 ( CSBP Ltd v LHMU ) a notice issued under s 441(6) of the WR Act advised: 
 
 You are advised that industrial action in the form a stoppage of seven (7) days duration will commence on Friday 6 April 2007. 
 

Of this notice, Gilmour J said, at [94]:
 
 
 the Protected Action Notice is arguably defective in failing to identify the start and finish times of the industrial action with greater precision, in the context of the particular circumstances which govern the operation of the Plant by the applicant. In my opinion the expression 'the nature of the intended action' is wide enough, arguably, in an appropriate case, and arguably this case is one, as to when on the specified day in the notice the intended action is to commence as well as the time on the last day when the intended action is to cease. If it were otherwise, in the circumstances of this case, the applicant would be required to take defensive steps for the period commencing immediately after midnight on the day before the intended action and in respect of the period up until midnight on the last day of the intended action. 
 

 His Honour went on in that paragraph to suggest that the recipient of the notice might well "over compensate" if there is a lack of specificity in the notice and this would be onerous. </sentence>
