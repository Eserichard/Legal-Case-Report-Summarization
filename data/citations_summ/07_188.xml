<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 743">The Commonwealth has pointed out that there will be cases in which it is important not only that persons are individually authorised as part of the applicant, but also that the particular group of persons is collectively authorised to act on behalf of the claim group. There may be sectional interests within the claim group whose interests are balanced by the particular combination of authorised persons. It is clear that such circumstances may arise. That is why s 66B empowers the claim group in its terms and in the circumstances it specifies. Que Noy v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 1888 provides an example of a claim group doing so. It would not be consistent with the clear objectives of the NT Act, on the other hand, to impose the s 66B procedure on the claim group where there were no such considerations. One might ask rhetorically why a native title claim group should have removed from it the capacity to make decisions for itself about whether, in particular circumstances, such as the death of an authorised person, it wishes to enliven s 66B or whether it is content to allow the remaining authorised applicants to continue to act in accordance with their authorisation? </sentence>
