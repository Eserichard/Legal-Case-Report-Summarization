For a proposed amendment to be a futility it would be necessary for this to be clear on the face of the pleading and for it to be so obviously futile that it would have been struck out if it had appeared in the original pleading. The decision of Foster J in Davis v Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (No 1) [2009] FCA 562 is an example. His Honour refused to allow amendments that were contrary to well-established principles of constitutional law; see in particular [57]-[58]. The proposed amendments are not futile in that sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 69">On 29 May 2009, I delivered judgment in Davis v Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (No 1) [2009] FLC 98-038 , [2009] FCA 562 , [2009] ALMD 4410 ( Davis No 1 ) . That judgment was delivered in these proceedings and determined various claims made by the applicant for interlocutory injunctive relief. In that judgment, I refused to grant any injunction. In these Reasons for Judgment I deal with the Notice of Motion filed by the second respondent ( the Registrar ) on 24 March 2009 whereby the Registrar sought an order that this proceeding be dismissed pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ( the Federal Court Act ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 729">The matter which is presently before the Court is a Notice of Motion filed 5 June 2009, superseded by an Amended Notice of Motion filed in Court today, in which relief was sought under Order 52 rule 10 of the Federal Court Rules . In order to place the application in context, a convenient starting point is to trace the formal progression of the matter within the Court. The following chronology should suffice for that purpose:
 20 January 2009 Application filed in proceedings NSD 52 of 2009 in which the applicant, the first respondent and the second respondent were as shown in the Notice of Motion presently before the Court. The third respondent named in the Application was 'Stipendiary Magistrate Mitchell' 6 March 2009 Amended Application filed in proceedings NSD 52 of 2009 in which the third respondent was identified as 'Magistrates of New South Wales', whatever that may mean, rather than 'Stipendiary Magistrate Mitchell' 24 March 2009 Notice of Motion filed by the second respondent seeking summary dismissal of the Amended Application pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Federal Court Act') 24 April 2009 Notice of Motion filed in Court by the applicant seeking interlocutory injunctive relief, leave to further amend the Application and declaratory relief 29 May 2009 Judgment of the primary judge pursuant to which the following substantive orders were made:
 'THE COURT: 
 GRANTS leave to the applicant to amend his Amended Application by: 
 (a) Inserting the words " ... pursuant to the Court's pendant or associated jurisdiction ... " in line 4 of the introductory paragraph in that Application between the words " law " and " to "; 
 (b) Adding par 9A in the terms of par 9A set out in the draft Further Amended Application marked as MFI-1 on 24 April 2009; and 
 (c) Adding par 1A to his Claims for Interlocutory Relief in the terms of par 1A set out in Section B of MFI-1. ... ORDERS that DC Beale, MJ Horton and AJ McMinn be joined as fourth respondent parties to the proceedings. 
 ORDERS that the Notice of Motion filed by the applicant on 24 April 2009 otherwise be dismissed. ...' 
 (See Davis v Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (No 1) [2009] FCA 562 ('the first judgment')) 29 May 2009 Order made by the primary judge as follows: 'The application by the applicant that [the primary judge] disqualify himself from hearing the Motion that is fixed before him on 29 May 2009 be refused' 
 (See Davis v Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (No 2) [2009] FCA 589 ('the second judgment')) 1 June 2009 Further Amended Application filed in proceedings NSD 52 of 2009 in which D C Beale, M J Horton and A J McMinn 'as trustees of the Estate of the late Dr Eric L Davis' were shown as Fourth Respondents 5 June 2009 Notice of Motion filed in proceeding NSD 535 of 2009 seeking leave to appeal from 'the whole of the judgment and orders of [the primary judge] given on 29 May 2009' and 'interim orders restraining the Respondents from taking any steps to sell the land or to execute against the funds and/or estate the subject of these proceedings pending hearing of the appeal' 5 June 2009 Affidavit of Peter Brian McKell, the solicitor for the applicant. Paragraph 5 identified the grounds of the 'application to appeal' (sic) as follows: '(a) That the learned Judge erred in identifying and applying the principal files (sic) with respect to interim relief; 
 (b) That the learned Judge erred in unnecessarily delaying the decision in the circumstances; [see the second judgment] 
 (c) That the learned judge erred in declining to hear the Applicant's Notice of Motion filed 22 May 2009, a copy of which is annexed and marked "A " [the copy Notice of Motion attached bore date 22 May 2009, was unsigned and was nominally returnable on 29 May 2009. The substantive orders sought in it were That the Second Respondent's Notice of Motion be dismissed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 589">The basis of the disqualification application is that, in light of a judgment which I delivered at 9.45 am this morning ( Davis v Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (No 1) [2009] FCA 562) , I should not proceed to hear the Motion because I had come to final views in respect of matters which inevitably arise for decision on that Motion.</sentence>
