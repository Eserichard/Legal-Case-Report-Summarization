<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1064">Mr Gibson referred to the decision in Martinez v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 781 where Goldberg J found at [33] that item 136.213(1)(a) of Schedule 2 required the Tribunal to determine 
 "(c) the nature of the work or duties undertaken by the applicant during this period..." 
 
In the present case the Court had only a very general description of the work performed by the applicant in Vietnam, and from that could not make a meaningful assessment of the equivalence of the course content in Vietnam and in Australia. At [25] ibid his Honour stated:
 
 "In my opinion the delegate was obliged to determine the nature of the work the applicant had undertaken. " 
 
In the present case the applicant had not supplied sufficient detail for that to be done. After the request for further information 
(Court Book 206.2 and 214.6) affidavits of Liu Thu Chin was received (Court Book 217 and 221) that relevantly merely stated that "Loan courses of training includes haircutting, washing, blowing, and drying, nail and beauty. " Marks are included at Court Book 221. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 879">The applicant submitted that the Tribunal made the same mistake as was made by a ministerial delegate and considered in Martinez v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 781. There, Goldberg J considered cl.136.213 of sch.2 to the Regulations which required the applicant to demonstrate that he had been "employed in a skilled occupation" for a particular period. The delegate rejected the applicant's claim to have been employed in a skilled occupation and performing the duties of the relevant occupation to the requisite level without having specifically determined the nature of the work that the applicant had undertaken, the duties involved and the period or periods during which the applicant had performed such work or duties. His Honour said: ... In my opinion, the delegate was obliged to determine the nature of the work which the appellant had undertaken and the duties he had undertaken in the course of his work and also the period or periods during which the appellant claimed to have undertaken that work and performed such duties. These matters were intertwined and both had to be addressed specifically in order for the delegate to determine whether the appellant satisfied subcl 136.213(1). As a matter of legal analysis, in order for the delegate to determine whether she was satisfied as to the nature of the employment of the appellant in the skilled occupation and that he had performed the duties of a cook it was necessary for the delegate to examine, consider and make a finding in respect of the period or periods during which the appellant had been employed in that occupation and performing those duties. If the delegate had turned her mind to identifying, and making a finding in respect of those periods, she may well have reached a different conclusion from the conclusion she reached in respect of her level of non-satisfaction as to the nature of the occupation undertaken by the appellant and the duties he performed as a cook.
