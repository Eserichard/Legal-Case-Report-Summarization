However, out of deference to the parties' submissions I would make the following observations. Mr Zdjelar's decision was one which was made under the guidelines which were but a statement of the Commissioner's policy. The decision Mr Zdjelar made was not made under any particular provision of the tax legislation. For that reason, it appears to be accepted that it was not a decision "under an enactment" within the meaning of the definition of "decision to which this Act applies" in s 3 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) and hence that no review is available under that legislation: White Industries Australia Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at 315 [75] per Lindgren J.

[8] In relation to that power it has been observed that: a court must be satisfied that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of success; the court need not be satisfied that the proceeding is hopeless or bound to fail; the legislature's intention in introducing the provisions concerning summary dismissal was to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment (including summary dismissal) below the level that had been fixed by authorities like Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [9] and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) &amp; Ors [10] which required that the allegations be quite clearly so untenable that they could not possibly succeed; there was not an intention on the part of the legislature to remove the bar completely; the mere presence of a trifling, implausible, tenuous or tangentially relevant factual controversy is not a bar to the exercise of the summary dismissal power; and what is required is a prediction of the outcome of a trial on the 
merits but not an actual adjudication of those merits. [11] 
 The Federal Court has also observed as follows in relation to the principles applicable on an application for summary dismissal: 6. Success under s 31A [of the FC Act] does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings; (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success.</sentence>

In so doing, his Honour referred to these remarks by Lindgren J in White Industries Australia Ltd v Cmr of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 , at [50]---[54]: [50] Section 31A of the FCA Act, like O 20 of the FCR, is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form.

<sentence id="cs14" from="[2010] FCA 1462">The operation of s 31A of the Federal Court Act has been canvassed in several recent authorities in this Court.

Justice Rares in Boston 236 ALR at [45] was of the view that, unless there are no real issues of fact --- such that "only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable" --- summary judgment (or dismissal) ought not be given pursuant to s 31A.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2010] FCA 1431">In Deckers Outdoor Corporation Inc v Farley &amp; Ors (No 2) [2009] FCA 256 ; (2009) 176 FCR 33 at 36-7 I observed that: 
 
 "11 Section 31A of the Federal Court Act was introduced to extend "the power of the court to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": see Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd (2008) 167 FCR 372 at 406 [124] (per Gordon J) (quoting from the Second Reading Speech of the Minister on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 (Cth)). The section empowers the Court to give summary judgement in favour of an applicant if it is satisfied that the respondent "has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding or [a] part of the proceeding": see s 31A(1)(b). A defence may have no reasonable prospect of success notwithstanding that it is not "hopeless" and not "bound to fail": see s 31A(3). 
 

 
 
 12 Plainly, s 31A was, as Lindgren J held in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [54] , designed "to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment" from the level that had been fixed by the High Court in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-2 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 128-130. Although the standard which must be met by an applicant who seeks summary judgment under the Federal Court Act has been expressed in a variety of different ways, where, as here, an application is made under s 31A, the Court is required to give close attention to the statutory language and to apply that test to the exclusion of all others. As Kenny J said in PZ Cussons (International) Ltd v Rosa Dora Imports Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1642 ; (2007) 74 IPR 372 at [13] :
 'The key is to address the statutory question. That is, under s 31A, in order to grant summary judgment, I must be satisfied that the respondents have no reasonable prospects of success in defending the infringement claim. As s 31A(3) makes clear, this does not mean that I must be satisfied that their defence is hopeless or bound to fail. '"

As Lindgren J said in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [45] : 
 
 
 "evidence may disclose that a person has or may have a 'reasonable cause of action' or 'reasonable prospects of success', yet the person's pleading does not disclose this. In such a case O 11, r 16 empowers the Court to strike out the pleading but ... s 31A(2) would not empower the Court to give judgment for the respondent against the applicant. A failure after ample opportunity to plead a reasonable cause of action may suggest that none exists and therefore that the applicant has no reasonable prospects of success, but the existence of a reasonable cause of action and the pleading of a reasonable cause of action remain distinct concepts.

[35] Australia, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 10 March 2005 at 3. [36] Australian Law Reform Commission, Managing Justice: A review of the federal civil justice system , Report No 89, (2000) at 520 [7.212] and Recommendation 94. In the Federal Court and in the Court of Appeal of Queensland, the criterion of a "reasonable prospect" of success has been understood in analogous statutory settings to mean a "real" rather than "fanciful" prospect [44] . This exegesis adds little to the words of s 31A. The section authorises summary disposition of proceedings on a variety of bases under its general rubric. It will apply to the case in which the pleadings disclose no reasonable cause of action and their deficiency is incurable. It will include the case in which there is unanswerable or unanswered evidence of a fact fatal to the pleaded case and any case which might be propounded by permissible amendment. It will include the class of case in the longstanding category of cases which are "frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of process". The application of s 31A is not, in terms, limited to those categories.

<sentence id="cs22" from="[2010] FCA 919">As Clear Telecoms submits: 
(a) Section 31A sets a lower bar for obtaining summary judgment than that which applied under authorities such as Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 ( White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [54] per Lindgren J; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 at [124] per Gordon J; also [19] per Finkelstein J). (b) In applying the section, it is necessary to examine critically the case in respect of which summary judgment is sought for the purposes of assessing whether it is sufficiently strong to warrant the matter going to trial (as distinct from hopeless or bound to fail) ( Bradken Resources Pty Ltd v Lynx Engineering Consultants Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1257 ; (2008) 78 IPR 586 at [28] per Emmett J). (c) That a case has no reasonable prospects of success might be established by the failure to plead a reasonable cause of action after ample opportunity to do so ( White Industries at [47]). (d) On the other hand, it might be necessary to decide whether the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment is of sufficient quality and weight for it to be able to succeed at trial ( Jefferson at [23] per Finkelstein J; [126]-[127] per Gordon J). (e) In determining whether a real issue of fact exists such as to preclude summary judgment, the Court must draw all reasonable (as distinct from only plausible) inferences in favour of the party seeking to resist summary judgment ( Jefferson at [132]). (f) What inferences are reasonable to draw will be affected by the seriousness of the allegations under consideration and the gravity of the consequences of any adverse findings that might be made ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Amcor Printing Papers Group Ltd [2000] FCA 17 ; (2000) 169 ALR 344 at [78] per Sackville J; s 140, Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2010] FMCA 667">In White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner for Taxation [2007] FCA 511 Lindgren J discussed the breadth and extent of s.31A, with reference also to s.17A of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 . His Honour made reference at [38] to a number of cases in which the section had been considered. Before saying, at [59]: "I do not propose to add greatly to the discussion of the meaning and effect of s 31A. In the United Kingdom it has been held in the context of the similar rule 24.2 of the CPRs noted at [53] above, that the expressions "no real prospect of succeeding" and "no real prospect of successfully defending" require attention to be given to real, as opposed to "fanciful" or "merely arguable" prospects. " [authorities omitted]. The Queensland Court of Appeal has similarly held, following Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER and the Three Rivers District Council v The Governor and Company of the Bank of England , but "no reasonable prospects of success" test requires the court to determine whether they are real "as supposed to fanciful prospects of success": Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Salcedo [2005] QCA 227. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2010] FCA 902">First, the concept of "striking out" an application, as distinct from dismissal, is misconceived as the continuation of a proceeding depends upon the existence of an application ( White Industries v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [48] per Lindgren J). Further, it is not the case that the Commission simply filed an application. The Commission complied with the Rules. It filed an application together with an affidavit. That affidavit did show the nature of the Commission's claim and material facts on which that claim was based, admittedly only in the most general sense and on information and belief. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2010] APO 13">In Les Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Pty Ltd [2008] APO 11 the delegate noted that a change had been made to section 31A since General Steel (supra) and Stack (supra) which meant that:
 
"the principles set out in General Steel (supra) are not given "canonical force" in summary dismissal proceedings ( Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 425 at 427). Rather, a proceeding may be dismissed where a party has "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding" (see for example Garrett v Macks [2006] FCA 601 , White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 , Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 , Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 , Vans, Inc. v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 , E . &amp; J.

As noted in the Servier decision, a similar approach is also applied in England and Queensland. It seems clear that Parliament has decided that the approach to summary judgment in all federal courts should be the same, and that the same approach applies to all matters (not just to migration cases). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2010] FMCA 548">The Federal Court possesses a like power under s.31A(2)(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). [15] In relation to the power under s.31A(2)(b) of the FC Act it has been observed that: a court must be satisfied that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of success; the court need not be satisfied that the proceeding is hopeless or bound to fail; the legislature's intention in introducing the provisions concerning summary dismissal was to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment (including summary dismissal) below the level that had been fixed by authorities like Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [16] and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) &amp; Ors [17] which required that the allegations be quite clearly so untenable that they could not possibly succeed; there was not an intention on the part of the legislature to remove the bar completely; the mere presence of a trifling, implausible, tenuous or tangentially relevant factual controversy is not a bar to the exercise of the summary dismissal power; and what is required is a prediction of the outcome of a trial on the merits but not an actual adjudication of those merits. [18] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2010] FCA 578">So much is to be contrasted with s 31A where matters outside the pleadings can be considered to arrive at a value judgment based on substance, not form: see, White Industries v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [50] , per Lindgren J. The JAILI case
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2010] FCAFC 53">75 His Honour correctly concluded (at para 13) that s 17A of the Federal Magistrates Act conferred a power to grant summary judgment equivalent to that conferred on this Court by s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), to grant summary judgment in proceedings before it. In so doing, his Honour referred to these remarks by Lindgren J in White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 , at [50] to [54]:
 
 
 [50] Section 31A of the FCA Act, like O 20 of the FCR, is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form. Section 31A(1) is comparable to O 20 r 1 in that they are both concerned with summary judgment for the party who is prosecuting the proceeding. Section 31A(2) is comparable to O 20 r 2 in that they are both concerned with dismissals of proceedings. 

101 In an authority cited by the learned Magistrate, White Industries Australia Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 , Lindgren J remarked, at [50], that "section 31A of the FCA Act, like O 20 of the Rules [of this Court], is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form...". His Honour went on to say, at [54], that:
 Under s 31A I must be satisfied that the applicants have no reasonable prospects of success, but as s 31A (3) makes clear, this does not mean that I must be satisfied that the proceeding is hopeless or bound to fail. I suggest that the legislature's intention in enacting s 31A was to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment (including summary dismissal) below the level that had been fixed by such authorities as Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2010] FCA 407">The Applicant on the 8 February 2010 Motion , the Respondent to the proceeding, takes issue with both the existing Statement of Claim and the proposed amendments. The proposed amendments, it is contended, still expose such deficiencies that leave to amend should be refused and the existing paragraphs [6] to [12] should be struck out pursuant to O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules . That rule provides as follows: 
 
 Embarrassment etc 
 Where a pleading: 
 (a) discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case appropriate to the nature of the pleading; 
 (b) has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the proceeding; or 
 (c) is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court; 
 the Court may at any stage of the proceeding order that the whole or any part of the pleading be struck out 
 

 
No order is sought that the Statement of Claim , or a part of the Statement of Claim , be dismissed pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Orders for summary judgment are fundamentally different to the order now sought: cf. Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd [2008] FCA 1920 at [3] to [8] [2008] FCA 1920 ; , 252 ALR 41 at 43 to 45 per Finkelstein J; White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [47] to [48] [2007] FCA 511 ; , 160 FCR 298 at 309 per Lindgren J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs30" from="[2010] APO 5">In Les Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Pty Ltd [2008] APO 11 the delegate noted that a change had been made to section 31A which meant that:
 
"the principles set out in General Steel (supra) are not given "canonical force" in summary dismissal proceedings ( Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 425 at 427).

As noted in the Servier decision, a similar approach is also applied in England and Queensland. It seems clear that Parliament has decided that the approach to summary judgment in all federal courts should be the same, and that the same approach applies to all matters (not just to migration cases).  However, I also have sympathy with Sepracor's submission that there could have been so much more included without having to go into "how the case will be argued". Wyeth also appears to agree with this in that they have filed an amended Statement with much more detail. Nevertheless, noting the detail that Wyeth supplied during the hearing as to their concerns about the priority date, there is certainly a point here that is much more than "merely arguable" (see White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511). It cannot be said that Wyeth's argument that the claims are only entitled to a priority date of 18 May 2009 (the date they were amended) has no reasonable prospects of success. While interference proceedings exist in the US, as noted by Wyeth, I am unsure what effect a decision under US law for US patent applications may have on the present Australian opposition.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs32" from="[2010] FCA 361">It should perhaps be further noted that the discretionary power conferred by O 11 r 16 to strike out pleadings is also different to the power conferred by O 20 r 2 to stay or dismiss proceedings: White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 , 160 FCR 298. Lindgren J there observed: 
 
 [47] The central concern of both O 20, r 2(1)(a) and s 31A is different from that of O 11, r 16, which empowers the Court to strike out pleadings. For example, evidence may disclose that a person has or may have a "reasonable cause of action" or "reasonable prospects of success", yet the person's pleading does not disclose this. In such a case O 11, r 16 empowers the Court to strike out the pleading but O 20 r 2(1)(a) would not empower the Court to order a stay or dismissal, and s 31A(2) would not empower the Court to give judgment for the respondent against the applicant. A failure after ample opportunity to plead a reasonable cause of action may suggest that none exists and therefore that the applicant has no reasonable prospects of success, but the existence of a reasonable cause of action and the pleading of a reasonable cause of action remain distinct concepts. 
 

 
 
 [48] Finally, it should be noted that "pleading" is defined in O 1 r 4 of the Rules as not including an application, notice of motion or affidavit. Thus, O 11, r 16 does not permit the striking out of an application. Indeed, the striking out, as distinct from the dismissal, of an application, would be misconceived, as the continuation of a proceeding depends upon the existence of an application. 
 

  At times the test has been put as high as saying that the case must be so plain and obvious that the court can say at once that the statement of claim, even if proved, cannot succeed; or 'so manifest on the view of the pleadings, merely reading through them, that it is a case that does not admit of reasonable argument'; 'so to speak apparent at a glance'. " 
 
 

 
 
 [6] In contrast, a s 31A application not only permits, but requires, a consideration of matters outside the pleadings: ... The application is, after all, a trial albeit a summary trial. In White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [50] , Lindgren J said that s 31A "is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form". That is to say, the "no reasonable prospect of success" standard is designed to test the adequacy of the evidence in support of the allegations, not just the allegations themselves. At the same time, it is important to understand that the court in deciding a motion for summary judgment does not, in testing that evidence, find any facts; rather, the court determines, as a matter of law, whether there are any facts that need to be found such that a trial is required: ... To put the point another way (ie in language that perhaps had more resonance in the days when juries were still used in civil cases), the court determines whether there is a real or genuine dispute as to any material fact --- whether any reasonable juror could find for the non-moving party on one or more of those material factual issues: ... If the answer to this question of law is no, then the judge can and must take the case from the jury and enter judgment accordingly.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs36" from="[2010] FCA 69">Other judges of this Court have used slightly different language to describe the onus which an applicant for summary judgment carries in this Court. For example, Lindgren J in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [59] said that the phrase ... no reasonable prospect of success ... requires attention to be given to real, as distinct from "fanciful" or "merely arguable" prospects.  The real question in every case is not so much whether there is any issue that could arguably go to trial but rather whether there is any issue that should be permitted to go to trial.

Although s.17A of the FMC Act (and the cognate s.31A Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ) were introduced to allow the courts more flexibility in dealing with what were perceived to be unmeritorious migration appeals (for the history of which see White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [55] ff) the legislation now embraces a test that allows a court considerably more scope in all proceedings than the 'traditional test' in cases such as Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125.

On the other hand, a party moving for summary dismissal must be entitled to an assessment of the position disclosed by the pleadings in their current state together with any evidence in the proceedings or on the motion.

Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: 
 
 
 (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings;
 (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; 
 (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; 
 (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial;
 (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; 
 (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial;
 (h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects; 
 (i) in determining if there are real issues of fact in issue so as to preclude summary judgment the courts must draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party.

<sentence id="cs43" from="[2009] FCA 1280">Plainly, s 31A was, as Lindgren J held in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at 310, designed "to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment" from the level that had been fixed by the High Court in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-2 and General Steel Industries Inc. v Commissioner for Railways (N.S.W. ) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 128-130. Although the standard which must be met by a respondent who seeks summary judgment under the FCA Act has been expressed in a variety of different ways, where, as here, an application is made under s 31A, the Court is required to give close attention to the statutory language and to apply that test to the exclusion of all others: see PZ Cussons (International) Ltd v Rosa Dora Imports Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1642 ; (2007) 74 IPR 372 at 375 (per Kenny J). </sentence>

For example, evidence may disclose that a person has or may have a "reasonable cause of action" or "reasonable prospects of success", yet the person's pleading does not disclose this. In such a case O 11 r 16 empowers the Court to strike out the pleading but O 20 r 2(1)(a) would not empower the Court to order a stay or dismissal, and s 31A(2) would not empower the Court to give judgment for the respondent against the applicant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs47" from="[2009] FMCA 959">For the reasons outlined in Davidson v McCann Worldgroup Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2009] FMCA 957 at [14] --- [30] in relation to the same argument, I am of the view that rule 13.10 is not a vehicle for dealing with deficient pleadings or points of claim and that under rule 1.05(2) of the FMC Rules regard should be had to Order 11 rule 16 of the Federal Court Rules in relation to any application to strike out pleadings or points of claim. I accept that where there is a failure to plead a reasonable cause of action there may also be no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a claim for relief in the application. However the concepts are distinct (see White Industries Aust Ltd and Another v Federal Commissioner of Taxation and Another (2007) 160 FCR 298 ; [2007] FCA 511 at [47] ).  Insofar as the respondents seek summary dismissal, in White Industries Aust Ltd and Another v Federal Commissioner of Taxation and Another (2007) 160 FCR 298 ; [2007] FCA 511 at [58] --- [59], Lindgren J suggested that a test in terms such as in rule 13.10 was a test of whether the prospect was real and not fanciful or merely arguable (also see Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd (ACN 107 746 798) and Others (2008) 250 ALR 82 ; [2008] FCA 1304 and Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1283 ; (2008) 78 IPR 51). However in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 at [59] , Greenwood J suggested that the court would rarely be satisfied that there was no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a claim, except in the most transparent of cases, on the strength of the conclusion that an applicant's statement of claim was deficient in whole or in part, having regard to the fact that leave to replead might reveal material or facts, within a properly identified legal framework, that on proof, gave rise to a recognised remedy. In Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 Gilmour J at [6] pointed out that in a case where evidence could " give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading ". </sentence>

He said, and I agree, that the intention of the Parliament in enacting s 31A:
 "... was to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment (including summary disposal) below the level that had been fixed by such authorities as Dey v Victorian Railways Commission [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-92, and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129-130. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs54" from="[2009] FCA 672"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs55" from="[2009] FCA 612">Mr Sharbutt's application for summary judgment is made under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the FCA"). In determining such an application, the principles to be applied are not in dispute: see Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [5] - [6]: Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] . Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs56" from="[2009] FCA 499">The principles governing the operation of s 31A of the Act were canvassed in detail by Lindgren J in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 ( White Industries ) and Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ( Boston ). In White Industries 160 FCR at [59], Lindgren J considered that a claim requires "real" as opposed to "fanciful" or "merely arguable" prospects in order for it to have reasonable prospects of success as required by s 31A. Justice Rares in Boston 236 ALR at [45] was of the view that, unless there are no real issues of fact --- such that "only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable" --- summary judgment (or dismissal) ought not be given pursuant to s 31A.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs57" from="[2009] FMCA 428">In a recent case, I considered and summarised the principles applicable in summary disposal applications under s.17A of the Federal Magistrates Act ("the FMC Act"). That case is Clement v Minister for Finance &amp; Deregulation [2009] FMCA 43. The principles are set out at [100] --- [107]. I will not repeat what I said there. The principal cases to which I referred were the decisions of Lindgren J in White Industries Australia Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 , and the Full Court decision in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 246 ALR 465. I emphasise and respectfully agree with Gordon J's analysis of s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 at [122] --- [135] and the six principles that her Honour articulates. Those principles, in my view, are applicable to applications in this Court under s.17A of the FMC Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs58" from="[2009] FCA 426">At the outset it should be recognised that s 31A has been said to be a provision which " lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment ": Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [5] per Gilmour J. A " reasonable prospect of success " for the purposes of the section is one which is real and not fanciful or merely arguable: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [59] [2007] FCA 511 ; , 160 FCR 298 at 312 per Lindgren J; Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1305 at [41] , [2008] FCA 1305 ; 250 ALR 82 at 92. And, unlike an application pursuant to O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) that a matter be struck out, where it is the adequacy of the pleadings which is in issue, an action pursuant to s 31A " not only permits, but requires, a consideration of matters outside the pleadings ": Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd (in liq) [2008] FCA 1920 at [3] to [8] [2008] FCA 1920 ; , 252 ALR 41 at 43 to 45 per Finkelstein J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs59" from="[2009] FCA 403">In any event, a general denial of the claim is not sufficient. Nor is it sufficient to simply put the applicant to proof in response to an application under s 31A of the Federal Court Act ( Vans, Inc. v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137). Section 31A is directed to the proceeding itself not simply with deficiencies in the pleadings and in that sense the section addresses the substance and not just the form by which the action or proceeding is structured ( White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [50] ). Before judgment might be entered pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court Act, the Court is required to be satisfied that the respondents have no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding. Even though the defence filed by the respondents need not be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success, it is clear in the face of the affidavit evidence of the applicant and the terms of the defence filed by the respondents, that the defence is bound to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs60" from="[2009] FCA 256">Plainly, s 31A was, as Lindgren J held in White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at 310 [54] , designed "to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment" from the level that had been fixed by the High Court in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-2 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 128-130. Although the standard which must be met by an applicant who seeks summary judgment under the Federal Court Act has been expressed in a variety of different ways, where, as here, an application is made under s 31A, the Court is required to give close attention to the statutory language and to apply that test to the exclusion of all others. As Kenny J said in PZ Cussons (International) Ltd v Rosa Dora Imports Pty Ltd (2007) 74 IPR 372 ; [2007] FCA 1642 at [13] : 
 "The key is to address the statutory question. That is, under s 31A, in order to grant summary judgment, I must be satisfied that the respondents have no reasonable prospects of success in defending the infringement claim. As s 31A(3) makes clear, this does not mean that I must be satisfied that their defence is hopeless or bound to fail. " 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs61" from="[2009] FCAFC 38">There is no meaningful difference between that circumstance and the application under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act in the present case. Insofar as this submission of Mr Spencer embraced the argument that s 31A did not permit the dismissal of a proceeding because the section refers to giving judgment, it is sufficient to note that s 4 of the Federal Court of Australia Act defines judgment as meaning a judgment, decree or order, whether final or interlocutory. The decision in White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 160 FCR 298 ; [2007] FCA 511 , referred to by Mr Spencer, does not support any conclusion to the contrary (see, in particular, at [50]). (2) Arnold involved water entitlements not carbon rights. This is not a relevant point of distinction.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs62" from="[2009] FMCA 69">In White Industries Australia Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (2007) FCA 511 Lindgren J noted at [50]: "Section 31A of the FCA Act, like 0 20 of the Rules, is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form ... " His Honour continued: " [51] Is there a difference between the concept of no reasonable cause of action being disclosed (O 20 r 2(1)(a)) and no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding (s 31A(2))? The only difference that suggests itself to me is that the latter makes plain that there may be taken into account the unavailability of evidence necessary to bring success at trial, whereas it is arguable that the former does not permit the unavailability of such evidence to be taken into account. 52.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs63" from="[2009] FCAFC 6">43 In considering whether to exercise the power to give judgment under s 31A of the Act, the Court is not concerned with mere pleading points. Rather, as Lindgren J held in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at 310 [50] (see too Noble Investments Pty Ltd v Southern Cross Exploration NL [2008] FCA 1963 [34]-[40] per Lander J) the section is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings and with substance, not just with form.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs64" from="[2009] FCA 53">Section 31A is not concerned as such with the bare question whether a person's pleading discloses a reasonable cause of action. Its concern is with substance and not just form. But as Lindgren J observed in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [47] , while the existence of a reasonable cause of action and the pleading of a reasonable cause of action remain distinct concepts --- 
 [a] failure after ample opportunity to plead a reasonable cause of action may suggest that none exists and therefore that the applicant has no reasonable prospects of success. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs65" from="[2009] FMCA 43">[67] (2007) 160 FCR 298. [68] Lindgren J also cited --- which I need not --- Queensland and New South Wales Courts of Appeal decisions, which follow the same reasoning. See [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [59] . [69] [1997] HCA 21 ; [1997] HCA 21 ; (1997) 144 ALR 677. These comments should be considered also in the light of his Honour's observations in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at [114] and [170].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs66" from="[2008] FCA 1920">6 In contrast, a s 31A application not only permits, but requires, a consideration of matters outside the pleadings: Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [37] . The application is, after all, a trial albeit a summary trial. In White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [50] , Lindgren J said that s 31A "is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form". That is to say, the "no reasonable prospect of success" standard is designed to test the adequacy of the evidence in support of the allegations, not just the allegations themselves. At the same time, it is important to understand that the court in deciding a motion for summary judgment does not, in testing that evidence, find any facts; rather, the court determines, as a matter of law, whether there are any facts that need to be found such that a trial is required: Three Rivers DC v Bank of England (No 3) [2003] 2 AC 1 , 282. To put the point another way (ie in language that perhaps had more resonance in the days when juries were still used in civil cases), the court determines whether there is a real or genuine dispute as to any material fact --- whether any reasonable juror could find for the non-moving party on one or more of those material factual issues: Boston Commercial [2006] FCA 1352 ; 70 IPR 146 at [43] . If the answer to this question of law is no, then the judge can and must take the case from the jury and enter judgment accordingly. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs67" from="[2008] FMCA 1617">The grounds raised by the applicant do not have any reasonable prospect of success in the sense considered in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 , White Industries Aust Ltd and Another v Federal Commissioner of Taxation and Another [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 and SZBMN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 268. The application is in effect an attempt to re-agitate the same issues as were dealt with previously that were unsuccessful. The grounds relied on are not such as to establish a basis on which it can be said that the applicant has a reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding having regard to the nature of those claims and the fact that the decision of the Tribunal has been the subject of judicial review proceedings on five previous occasions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs68" from="[2008] FMCA 1604">I am satisfied that this application is in effect an attempt to reagitate the same issues that have been dealt with in past judicial review proceedings. In light of my discussion of the grounds relied on and the findings in the prior judicial review proceedings, as submitted by the first respondent, the application should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 13.10(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules on the basis that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting these proceedings (see Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 , White Industries Aust Ltd and Another v Federal Commissioner of Taxation and Another [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 and SZBMN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 268x). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs69" from="[2008] FCA 1529">41 In Jefferson Ford at [45], Rares J commented that, when the Court gives judgment for a party under s 31A(1) or s 31A(2) ' it is exercising a jurisdiction similar to the implied or inherent power of the Court to protect its own processes from proceedings which are an abuse of those processes '. His Honour expressed the view that, by enacting s 31A, Parliament broadened the categories of case in which the power summarily to determine proceedings could be exercised and (at [57]) that it was not intended to create final, rather than interlocutory, judgments. Rather, it was intended to ' lower the bar ' (per Rares J at [63]) or, to put it another way, to ' impose a different and less stringent test ' (per Gordon J at [124]) for obtaining summary judgment, below the level set by the test in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 ( White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 per Lindgren J). It was introduced ' to strengthen "... the power of the court to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases"' ( Jefferson Ford at [124] per Gordon J; Boston Commercial at [45] per Rares J; citing the Second Reading Speech to the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 (Cth)).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs70" from="[2008] FCA 1667">3 It is relevant, in my opinion, to note that this is an appeal by an unrepresented litigant from a judgment which is founded on the application of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Federal Court Act). As Lander J said in the judgment, the subject of the present appeal, at paragraph 49: 
 
 
 Section 31A of the Federal Court Act was enacted by the legislature with full knowledge of the decisions of the High Court in relation to the summary dismissal of proceedings and, in particular, the decision of the High Court in Dey [1949] HCA 1 ; 78 CLR 62 at 91 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. It may be thought, in those circumstances, that the purpose of the enactment of s 31A was to relax the rigours of the test imposed by the High Court in General Steel Industries [1964] HCA 69 ; 112 CLR 125 as to the necessary circumstances in which a proceeding may be struck out summarily: Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 ; (2006) 65 ATR 222 and White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. </sentence>

24 Although there has been debate about whether the word "may" in s 31A(2) vests in the Court a power conditional on certain facts being found or discretion (see, for example, Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd (2008) 167 FCR 372 ; [2008] FCAFC 60 at [127] --- [128] and JF Keir Pty Ltd v Sparks [2008] FCA 611 at [12] ), certain aspects of the operation of the provision are clear. First, s 31A(3) , in terms, discloses that s 31A(2) involves a less stringent test than that applicable at common law for summary dismissal. Secondly, and as Rares J observed in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; [2006] FCA 1352 at [46] , " s 31A regulates the attainment of justice by creating an entitlement in a party to be protected from claims or defences which fail to meet the threshold prescribed in the section". Thirdly, and again as Rares J said in Boston Commercial Services at [45], "in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s 31A , the court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing the proceedings where... contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed. As soon as the evidence may have such an ambivalent character prior to a final determination, I am of opinion that then, as a matter of law, at that point there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s 31A. Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, the moving party will not have discharged its onus to enliven the discretion to authorise a summary termination of the proceedings which s 31A envisages". This is consistent with the statement by Tamberlin J in Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCA 875 at [14] that "... it is essential that the Court must be careful not to do an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings, or denying an applicant an opportunity to ventilate their case ...". Fourthly, and as Lindgren J noted in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 160 FCR 298 ; [2007] FCA 511 at [50] , s 31A "is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs72" from="[2008] FMCA 1340">That is an abuse of the process of the Court. Had the claims not been dismissed already, they would be dismissed on this ground. Ms Watson referred to the decision in White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 240 ALR 792 that in determining whether there is no reasonable prospect of success, " the unavailability of evidence necessary to bring success at trial " may be taken into account. The Court takes the unavailability of evidence into account in determining that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of success. The applicant has placed all material before the Court that she is likely to be able to produce, as in SYG 2109 of 2006 she has filed 
26 affidavits and three points of claim documents; in SYG 655 of 2007 she has filed nine affidavits and one points of claim document.</sentence>

Having regard to those observations, I approach the application made by the Respondents on the basis that a reasonable prospect of success for the purposes of the section is one which is real, not fanciful or merely arguable.

Although s.17A of the FMCA Act (and the cognate s.31A Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ) were introduced to allow the courts more flexibility in dealing with what were perceived to be unmeritorious migration appeals (for the history of which see White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [55] ff) the legislation now embraces a test that allows a court considerably more scope in all proceedings than the 'traditional test' in cases such as Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125.

I think it is fair to say that the standard which s 31A sets, relevantly in the case of subs (2), '... no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding ...', apart from the fact that it does not require the proceeding to be hopeless or bound to fail (see subs (3)), has not been settled by an appellate court; and the recent decision of a Full Court in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Co of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 did nothing to advance this cause.

I have arrived at a similar construction independently of this extrinsic material. However, it confirms the meaning at which I have arrived see: sub-ss 15AB(1)(a), 2(e) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). In White Industries Ltd v FCT [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at 310-312 [51] - [60] Lindgren J discussed the legislative history and purpose for enacting s 31A and its cognate provisions. He said, and I agree, that the intention of the Parliament in enacting s 31A "... was to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment (including summary disposal) below the level that had been fixed by such authorities as Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-92 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129-130": White Industries 160 FCR at 310 [54].
  175 By and large, I do not disagree with the historical analysis undertaken by Finkelstein J at [3]-[16]. I say "by and large," because while it is no doubt true that summary judgment in Australia had its genesis in O XIV, the immediate historical predecessor for s 31A is not O XIV but Pt 24 of the English Rules of Civil Procedure (CPR) adopted in 1998: White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [53] ; see also JT Nominees Pty Ltd v Macks (2007) 97 SASR 151 ; Boston Commercial Services [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146. In other words, if an historical analysis is to be undertaken, reference needs to be made not only to English cases applying O XIV, but also to the English cases applying Pt 24 of the CPR.</sentence>

I have also borne in mind the scope of the test for summary dismissal now applicable under r.13.10(a) and s.17A of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 and the equivalent provision in s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 as discussed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Proprietary Limited v G E Capital Finance Australasia Proprietary Limited [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 and also in White Industries Australia Limited and Another v The Commissioner for Taxation and Another [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [45] --- [60]. </sentence>

4 Whether or not the applicant/cross-respondent was entitled to amend without leave need not be determined as the parties are agreed that the substance of the matter should be decided on the basis that the respondent/cross-claimant is to satisfy the Court that the test laid down by s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is met. There is a burgeoning number of authorities which have considered the relatively straightforward wording of s 31A. Many of the authorities are cited by Lindgren J in White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [58] ; see also Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] . Subsection (3) of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) makes it clear that the way in which the previous regime had developed should no longer govern the question. Beyond that I respectfully see little merit in this case in considering judicial paraphrases of ordinary English. </sentence>

 26 On the Second Reading Speech of the Bill, the Attorney-General noted that the courts would have an increased ability " to deal with unmeritorious matters, by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases" . In White Industries Aust Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 , Lindgren J examined the introduction and operation of section 31A at some length: see paragraphs [50] to [60]. At paragraph [53] Lindgren J noted that the "no reasonable prosects of success" formula echoed rule 24.2 of the United Kingdom's Civil Procedure Rules in which context that formula has been held to " require attention to be given to real, as opposed to ' fanciful ' or ' merely arguable prospects'": see Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91 at 92; Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England (No 3) [2003] 2 AC 1 at [90], [95], [133-134] [158-162], and ED &amp; F Man Products Ltd v Patel [2003] EWCA Civ 742 at [8] . His Honour also noted that the formula has been used in a similar context in Queensland's Uniform Civil Procedure Rules : see Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Salcedo [2005] QCA 227 ; [2005] 2 Qd R 232 at 235. At paragraph [54] his Honour observed that the " legislature's intention in enacting s31A was to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment (including summary dismissal) below the level that had been fixed by such authorities as Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-92. " At paragraph [55] his Honour noted that " by ' broadening the grounds ' the Attorney General was referring to the formula ' no reasonable prospect of success' , as contrasted with a 'hopeless' or ' bound to fail' test" .

<sentence id="cs96" from="[2008] FCA 55">5 The focus of Termicide's submissions on the hearing of the motion was on whether the substantive application itself should be dismissed in the exercise of the power conferred on the Court by s 31A(2) of the Act . Put another way, the focus was on the proceedings' prospects, not just with pleadings, on substance, not form: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [50] per Lindgren J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs97" from="[2008] FCA 29">39 The applicant accepts that it must show that the respondent has no reasonable prospect of successfully resisting the claim: see White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [54] ; Lawrenson Light Metal Die Casting Pty Ltd (in liq) v Cosmik Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 753 at [15] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs98" from="[2007] FMCA 2104">Section 17A was inserted into the Court's statute by the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 and commenced on 1 December 2005. It was designed to have general application and to strengthen the power of the Court to deal with unmeritorious proceedings by broadening the grounds on which the Court can summarily dispose of them: Explanatory Memorandum to Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 . The fact that the purpose of the section is to make obtaining summary dismissal easier than previously has been recognised: Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [27] ; Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [54] ; Balding v Ten Talents Pty Limited [2007] FMCA 145 ; Vivid Entertainment LLC v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Limited [2007] FMCA 157. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs99" from="[2007] FMCA 1788">That Act also amended the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 with an equivalent provision at s.31A ; the only difference being that s.31A applies only to proceedings commenced after 1 December 2005. The Explanatory Memorandum for s.17A of the Federal Magistrates Act is in identical terms to the Explanatory Memorandum for s.31A of the Federal Court Act and provides that a proceeding "need not be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success", signifying a movement away from the principles enunciated in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioner [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 ; cases which, the Explanatory Memorandum indicated, "demonstrate the great caution which the courts have exercised in regard to summary disposal, limiting this to cases which are manifestly groundless or clearly untenable". 
It has been accepted by the Federal Court that, as articulated by Lindgren J in White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [54] :
 
 "Under s.31A I must be satisfied that the applicants have no reasonable prospect of success, but as s.31A makes clear, this does not mean that I must be satisfied that the proceeding is hopeless or bound to fail. I suggest that the legislature's intention was to lower the bar for summary dismissal below the level that had been fixed. "

<sentence id="cs100" from="[2007] FCA 1642">
 

13 By enacting s 31A , Parliament intended "to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment (including summary dismissal) below the level that had been fixed by such authorities as Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-92 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129-130": see White Industries Aust Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [54] per Lindgren J. Judges have differed, however, about the extent to which the provision achieves this end, but these differences probably do not much matter. The key is to address the statutory question. That is, under s 31A , in order to grant summary judgment, I must be satisfied that the respondents have no reasonable prospect of success in defending the infringement claim. As s 31A(3) makes clear, this does not mean that I must be satisfied that their defence is hopeless or bound to fail. </sentence>

14 Section 31A Federal Court Act applies to all cases commenced on or after 1 December 2005. The nature of the provision and its overlap with O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules have been considered in a number of cases in this Court, including the recent decision of Lindgren J in White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511. In that case, his Honour articulated a number of principles including:
 
&#8226; Section 31A of the Federal Court Act, like O 20 of the Rules, is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form (at [50]). &#8226; Section 31A(2) is comparable to O 20 r 2 in that they are both concerned with dismissals of proceedings (at [50]). 28 In any event, having regard to the decision of Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 , it is clear that the applicant would be no more successful on the material before me in claiming relief under the ASIC Act than she was before his Honour in claiming relief under the Trade Practices Act . In light of the principles articulated by Lindgren J in White Industries [2007] FCA 511 , it is plain that the claim has no reasonable prospects of success in terms of s 31A Federal Court Act.

There has been no argument put before the Court by the applicant and nor indeed is there any argument available to the applicant which holds any prospect of success in establishing that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider afresh his entitlement to a protection visa or that it fell into jurisdictional error in finding that it had no jurisdiction. </sentence>

His Honour stated at [58-60] [58] Third, while s.31A of the FCA Act (mutatis mutandis, s.17A of the FM Act) achieves nothing of significance in relation to migration cases, it is of general application and therefore affects all proceedings brought in the Court.
