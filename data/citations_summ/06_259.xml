<citphrase id="cp2.21" type=cited from="[1982] FCA 231">administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (cth), s. 5. the three applicants applied, pursuant to the provisions of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 , for an order of review of (a) the decision of the respondent madigan refusing the grant of permanent resident status in australia to the applicants and of (b) deportation orders signed by the respondent menadue for the deportation of the first and second applicants who were husband and wife. the third applicant was their daughter. the applicants contended, inter alia, that in making her decision the respondent madigan (i) failed to give them an opportunity to put material concerning their character to the first respondent; (ii) failed to inform the applicants of criteria to be applied concerning the determination of character; (iii) took into account irrelevant considerations; and (iv) failed to take into account a relevant consideration.  the applicants further contended that the deportation orders were invalid because they were not made by the minister of state for immigration and ethnic affairs (the minister) but by the respondent menadue who, they alleged, lacked the requisite power.  at the request of the applicants, the director-general of the australian security intelligence organization (a.s.i.o) and the assistant commissioner (crime) of the australian federal police (the police commissioner) were subpoenaed to produce certain specified documents to the court. the director-general of a.s.i.o. swore an affidavit in which he objected to producing documents to the court on the ground that they contained intelligence relevant to security within the meaning of that expression in the australian security intelligence organization act 1979 (the 1979 act). the director-general contended that production of such documents would be contrary to the requirements of security, and hence contrary to the public interest. the director-general asserted that the court had no power to compel the production of the documents or to inspect such documents or to order production of the documents for inspection by the parties. the acting attorney-general, who was the minister responsible for a.s.i.o., swore an affidavit in which he objected to the disclosure of information which would be prejudicial to the national security. the attorney objected to the production of documents because disclosure would be contrary to the public interest as it could endanger the safety of persons and property. the minister for foreign affairs swore an affidavit objecting to the production of portions of the documents as disclosure would prejudice the conduct of australia's foreign affairs and hence would be contrary to the public interest. the police commissioner swore an affidavit in which he objected to production of portions of the documents because disclosure would be contrary to the public interest as disclosure of the identity of police informers could seriously prejudice the prevention of crime and the protection of persons and property.  the police commissioner produced the requested documents to the court for inspection to determine whether they should be produced for inspection by the applicants.  held: (1) the court would order that the documents produced to the court by the commissioner of the australian federal police would be released to him on condition that he returned copies of such documents or such parts of such documents which the court had stated might be inspected by the applicants, on or before a specified date.  (2) the proceeding would be adjourned to a specified date to deal further with the application by the applicants for inspection of the documents produced to the court by the police commissioner, and with the application by the applicants for production and inspection of the documents subpoenaed from the director-general of a.s.i.o.  (3) the final decision concerning the production of documents by the director-general of a.s.i.o. rested with the court, not with the executive.  haj-ismail v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs [1981] fca 124 ; (1981) 56 flr 67 ; sankey v. whitlam [1978] hca 43 ; (1978) 142 clr 1 ; united states v. nixon [1974] ussc 159 ; (1974) 418 us 683 ; conway v. rimmer [1968] ukhl 2 ; (1968) ac 910 ; australian national airlines commission v. commonwealth [1975] hca 33 ; (1975) 132 clr 582 ; lanyon pty. ltd. v. commonwealth [1974] hca 11 ; (1974) 129 clr 650 ; re grosvenor hotel london (no. 2) (1965) ch 1210 ; burmah oil co. ltd. v. governor and company of the bank of england [1979] ukhl 4 ; (1980) ac 1090 , referred to.  per lockhart j.</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp2.22" type=cited from="[1982] FCA 231">two aspects of the public interest may conflict, namely, the public interest that injury should not be done to the national interest by disclosure of certain documents, and the public interest that the ends of justice should not be defeated by the withholding of relevant evidence. in evaluating the respective public interests, the court would give considerable weight to the opinion of the responsible minister that the documents would not be produced, but the court was entitled to inspect the documents privately and reach its own conclusion on the question of whether or not the public interest was properly served by the production of the documents.  burmah oil co. ltd. v. governor and company of the bank of england [1979] ukhl 4 ; (1980) ac 1090 ; environmental defence society inc. v. south pacific aluminium ltd. (no. 2) (1981) nzlr 153 ; sankey v. whitlam [1978] hca 43 ; (1978) 142 clr 1 , referred to.  (4) the court's power to inspect documents should be exercised only if, after considering the affidavits or certificates of the acting attorney-general or the director-general of a.s.i.o., the issues in the case and the relevance of the documents, the court was in doubt whether they would be likely to contain material helpful to the case of the applicants as the parties seeking production of the documents.  sankey v. whitlam [1978] hca 43 ; (1978) 142 clr 1 , referred to.  (5) having inspected the documents the court was satisfied that the interests of justice did not require the disclosure to the applicants of the documents or parts of documents where objection was taken to their being inspected by the applicants, and the applicants would suffer no injustice by non-disclosure.  r. v. debic unreported (new south wales court of appeal, 27th may, 1982), referred to.  (6) as neither the acting attorney-general nor the director-general of a.s.i.o. swore that he had personally examined the documents which he objected to producing, nor were the documents identified with any precision, the acting attorney-general and the director-general should be afforded an opportunity to reconsider the matter of the production of the documents, including the swearing of further affidavits. further consideration might then be given to the inspection of the documents by the court and submissions may be made by the parties and the director-general of a.s.i.o.</citphrase>
