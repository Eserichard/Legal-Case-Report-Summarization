<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 266">alternatively, damages in respect of breach of the Offer Letter. The trial on the issue of liability was held on 12, 13 and 14 November 2008. On 18 December 2008 reasons for decision for were delivered: Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd v FKP Limited [2008] FCA 1915. The Court held a binding contract existed between Coles and Lifestyle comprised of the Offer Letter, Coles' standard agreement for lease and lease attached to the Offer Letter and development plans dated 19 November 2007 prepared by i2C Design and Management Pty Ltd (the Lease Agreement ). Final Orders were not made on that day. Parties were directed to file agreed minutes of Orders for the further conduct of the proceeding and, if no agreement could be reached, to file a joint statement identifying points of agreement, points of disagreement, and their respective positions on those points of disagreement. The parties could not reach agreement and the proceeding was listed for hearing on 16 February 2009. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 29">It is possible that it might include matters which are not personal injuries, and it might, for example, allege injury, being loss or damage, as a consequence of conduct which constitutes a breach of the Tenancy Agreement. That might constitute loss or damage for the purposes of a misleading and deceptive conduct claim, assuming that an appropriate contractual representation is relied upon, and the loss or damage was proven. [51] However, if this is what is intended, it is not readily discernible from the Amended Statement of Claim as presently pleaded. Ms Carter's claim is not therefore maintainable in relation to the "pain and suffering, humiliation, embarrassment and stress" referred to in paragraph 10 of the Amended Statement of Claim. At this stage, however, the Court is not prepared to conclude that the alleged misleading and deceptive conduct does not extend to the suffering of "injury" constituting "loss and damage" for the purposes of s.82 of the TP Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1098">The primary judge observed that at some points in the material before him, the applicant seemed to suggest these claims were based in contract. His Honour noted that a more fundamental legal issue would have to be resolved at trial concerning the interaction between the Trade Practices Act and the contractual promises relied upon by the applicant: see Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd v FKP Limited [2008] FCA 1915 at [67] - [69]. Insofar as the claims were contractual, his Honour concluded that it would be inappropriate to give summary judgment, as any breach of the licence agreements would sound in damages if the applicant suffered loss. His Honour concluded that "(m)aking a declaration of breach, even if breach was now established, would be a barren exercise. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 682">In Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd v FKP Ltd [133] a single Judge of the Federal Court observed as follows: 67 The interaction between the TPA and the law of contract is interesting and has been the subject of previous consideration: see by way of example Concrete Constructions Group v Litevale Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 670 ; (2002) 170 FLR 290 ; Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis [1992] VicRp 63 ; [1992] 2 VR 217 ; Mander Forklift Pty Ltd v Dairy Farmers Co-operative (1990) ATPR (Digest) 46-061. 68 In Futuretronics at 239, Ormiston J "expressed [his] doubts whether a contractual promise of itself carries with it any representation as to fact or conduct" actionable by reason of s 51A.

The issue was adverted to recently in a judgment of Gordon J in Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd v FKP Limited [2008] FCA 1915 at [67] --- [69]: 
 
 [67] The interaction between the TPA and the law of contract is interesting and has been the subject of previous consideration: see by way of example Concrete Constructions Group v Litevale Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 670 ; (2002) 170 FLR 290 ; Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis [1992] VicRp 63 ; [1992] 2 VR 217 ; Mander Forklift Pty Ltd v Dairy Farmers Co-operative (1990) ATPR (Digest) 46-061.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCAFC 21">34 Telstra placed reliance on the observations of Gordon J in Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd v FKP Ltd [2008] FCA 1915 ( Coles Supermarkets ) at [63] where her Honour rejected an argument that equitable and legal obligations of confidence can co-exist in reliance on Del Casale v Artedomus (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 172 ; (2007) 73 IPR 326 at [118] . There Campbell JA said that "If there was a contractual obligation that covered the topic, there would, of course, be no occasion for equity to intervene to impose its own obligation". However that does not cover the present case, where Optus wishes to be able to seek an account of profits, and the question is whether the contract permits that. In our view clauses 15.6 and 20.22 show that it does.</sentence>
