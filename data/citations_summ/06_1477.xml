<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 972">On appeal, Cowdroy J noted that in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SCAR (supra) the Full Court of the Federal Court found that the Tribunal innocently provided unfair treatment to the appellant in circumstances where the appellant was ill. [12] 
His Honour went on to find at [27] that there was in that case and in several other cases cited: Some error or omission or conduct on the part of the Tribunal which led to the hearing being infected with jurisdictional error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 871">The statutory obligation upon the Tribunal to provide a 'real and meaningful' invitation exists whether or not the Tribunal is aware of the actual circumstances which would defeat that obligation. " 


 
 22 Although the reasoning in SCAR has not met with universal approval (see, for example, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142 ; (2006) 154 FCR 365 at 417 per Graham J), it was a unanimous decision of a Full Court of this Court and has been followed by subsequent Full Courts: see Appellant P119/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 230 ; and NALQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 121 ; and also cf SZFDE at 389 per French J and 400 per Allsop J. In any event SCAR remains binding on me, as on other judges of this Court at first instance: also cf NAQF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 781 ; (2003) 130 FCR 456 (" NAQF ") at 475-476 per Lindgren J and SZBII v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1477 at [26] per Cowdroy J. In NAQF , at 476, Lindgren J referred to SCAR and observed, by way of illustration of the nature of the s 360(1) obligation, that there would be a breach of this provision "[i]f, at an MRT hearing, the member were to inform the applicant that it was not necessary for the applicant to give evidence or present arguments on such an issue, which, it transpired, in fact remained alive, and thereby dissuaded the applicant from exercising his or her right to give evidence or to present arguments on that issue". 23 SCAR is consistent with the approach adopted more recently by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 (" SZBEL ").</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 238">42 That expression of principle is entirely consistent with the views expressed by his Honour, Besanko J at paragraph 34 in the reasons in SZGQL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1420 ; SZBSZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 779 , per Bennett J, [25] and [26]; SZBII and Another v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Another [2006] FCA 1477 per Cowdroy J, at [26] and [27]; and NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184 at [16] per Tamberlin, Sackville and Hely JJ.</sentence>
