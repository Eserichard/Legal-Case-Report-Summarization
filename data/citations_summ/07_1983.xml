<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 368">However, in Slick v Westpac Banking Corporation (No 2) [2006] FCA 1712 at [43] , particular discovery was refused on the basis that 'the theoretical possibility that something might turn up [was] well and truly outweighed by the cost and burden to Westpac' (see also Betts [2007] FCA 1983).  It is well established that generally a discovery affidavit is conclusive on the question of whether a party has or has had in its possession, custody or control of any relevant documents other than those discovered: Betts Group Pty Ltd v Paul's Retail Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1983 at [15] ; Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341. </sentence>
