<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] SASC 337">Counsel for the defendant argued on a line of cases represented by Environmental Earth Sciences v Vouris [5] and McDonald v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [6] that the genesis for the order for costs had been sufficiently established at the commencement of the DOCA so that the circumstances giving rise to the debt should be found to have occurred before the relevant date. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] VSC 128">223 In Environmental and Earth Sciences Pty Ltd v Vouris, [60] Graham J of the Federal Court of Australia summarised the authorities on contingent liabilities at length. [61] His analysis confirmed the necessity that there be a present obligation owed by the debtor to the creditor which on the happening of a future event may ripen into a sum certain. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCAFC 185">122 The Second Deed, in its terms, imposed an obligation on LSE to make certain payments to Capital Finance on specific dates: see [102] and [103] above. It specified a liquidated sum in money as presently due and owing on a particular date --- by LSE to the Capital Companies. "Creditor" is not defined in the Corporations Act . Its meaning is flexible and varies according to its context: see, by way of example, Environmental &amp; Earth Sciences Pty Ltd v Vouris [2006] FCA 679; [2006] FCA 679 ; (2006) 152 FCR 510 at [40] - [41] and Dimos v Willetts [2000] VSCA 154 ; (2000) 2 VR 170 at [106] - [108]. In the present context, it can be taken to include persons who had existing rights in relation to monetary claims against LSE and who would be entitled to prove in a winding up of LSE under s 553 of the Corporations Act . The relevant date for ascertaining which persons or entities were creditors who might prove in the winding up was the date the administration commenced: Re Crawford House Press Pty Ltd (1995) 17 ACSR 295 at 298 and Environmental &amp; Earth Sciences at [41]. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] NSWSC 289">The chairperson of a meeting to which regulations 5.6.12 to 5.6.57 apply has certain duties with respect to assessment, admission and rejection of proofs of debt for voting purposes. It is not necessary to go into the details of those duties here. They have been examined in a number of cases: see, for example, Vincent, White &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Vouris (1998) 28 ACSR 93 , Re Oriel Homes Pty Ltd [1998] 1 QdR 652 , Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd v Wily [2003] NSWSC 467 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 612 , Kirwan v Cresvale Far East Ltd (above), Spiteri v Lindholm [2003] VSC 42 , Selim v McGrath [2003] NSWSC 927 ; (2003) 47 ACSR 537 , J Aron Corp v Newmont Yandal Operations Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 238 and Environmental &amp; Earth Sciences Pty Ltd v Vouris [2006] FCA 679 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 629. The important point, for present purposes, is that decisions on proofs of debt for the purposes of voting must be made and completed before any question of the exercise of a casting vote by the chairperson arises. Indeed, they must be completed before the activity which determines whether the casting vote will become available to be exercised, that is, voting by creditors.</sentence>
