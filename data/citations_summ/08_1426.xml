"The discretion is at large. There are no mandatory statutory criteria, and it is wrong to regard factors seen as relevant by one court as statutory criteria. Indeed, lists of factors can confuse an essentially straightforward task and lead to over-elaborate reasoning. "
 
  The relevant considerations in assessing an appropriate penalty for breaches of industrial relations legislation have also been discussed extensively in other recent authorities; see eg, Australian Building &amp; Construction Commissioner v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2010] FCA 977 ; Stuart v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2010] FCAFC 65 ; (2010) 185 FCR 308 ; Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Cahill [2010] FCAFC 39; (2010) 269 ALR 1 ; Cozadinos v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2010] FCA 48 ; Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61 , at [40]. The appeal
  I do not accept the appellants' contention that the learned Federal Magistrate regarded the lack of contrition or remorse by Deans and the CFMEU as an aggravating matter when he came to quantify the pecuniary penalties. The presence or absence of contrition or cooperation by a contravening party are matters to which regard may properly be had when considering specific deterrence and assessing an appropriate penalty (see, Australian Building &amp; Construction Commissioner v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2010] FCA 977 , at [85]; Cozadinos v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2010] FCA 48 , at [38]; Construction, Forestry, Mining, Energy Union v Safety Glass Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 989 , at [16]; Hardwick v Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union [2010] FCA 818 , 198 IR 312 , at [14] and Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61 , at [40].

 [40] In my view, potentially relevant and applicable considerations for determining the appropriate penalty for a contravention of the BCII Act include:

A Court could even feel embarrassment at quoting once again the highly relevant and considered views of Buchanan J in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 246 ALR 35 at [91] that: "These matters should not be treated as "a rigid catalogue of matters for attention". The overriding principle is for the Court to "fix penalty which pays appropriate regard to the circumstances in which the contraventions have occurred and the need to sustain public confidence in the statutory regime which imposes the obligation. "" 
The Court is of course sensible of the fact that it is not writing for solely an appellate division but is explaining to those whose conduct has offended the reasons why it has chosen a particular penalty to be imposed. It is for this reason that it is necessary to set out those matters that the Court proposes to take into account even though they have been expressed before in such cases as CFMEU v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at 232 [7-8] per Branson J; Stewart-Mahony v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61 ; Alfred v Wakelin (No 1) [2008] FCA 1455 ; Alfred v Wakelin (No 4) [2009] FCA 267 ; (2009) 180 IR 335 ; Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169.

 The factors relevant to a penalty for a contravention of the BCII Act have been set out in a number of decisions of the Federal Court such that the factors which are to be considered in relation to penalty are now well established; see, eg, Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 per Tracey J at [40]. The relevant considerations include: the nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches. the circumstances in which that relevant conduct took place. Conclusion 
 I note as referred to in submissions, that given the admission by the first respondent in these proceedings a fine previously suspended by order in Gregor v CFMEU &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 1266 will become payable. [6] I also note the agreed penalties in this matter are 25% of the maximum.

Having regard to the nature of the conduct and the other factors referred to in the parties submissions I am prepared to accept the agreed position of the parties on penalty. I accept as was said in Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 at paragraph [53] that: "... (iii) There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation... (iv) The view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is relevant, but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty... (vi) Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty, it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement.</sentence>

 CONSTRUCTION FORESTRY, MINING AND ENERGY UNION 
First Respondent
 
And
 DANIEL BERARDI 
Second Respondent
 
 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 (Ex tempore) 
 Murray Gregor ("the applicant") is an inspector appointed pursuant to s.57 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 
 2005 ("the BCII Act"). On 20 May 2009 the applicant commenced proceedings against the Construction Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ("the first respondent") and Daniel Berardi ("the second respondent").  It will be appropriate if within the permissible range. [10] " As is clear from the above the parties had agreed not only on the quantum on the penalty they submitted the Court should impose but also that at least one of those penalties should be suspended. [11] The Court was referred to a number of decisions of the Federal Court where suspended penalties had been considered appropriate [12] . In relation to the second respondent I am satisfied an order in those terms is appropriate. Conclusion 
 I am prepared to accept the agreed position of the parties on penalty. 

23. The maximum penalties for a contravention of s.38 of the BCII Act are $22,000 for an individual and $110,000 for an organisation [4] . Approach to penalty proceedings 
 The factors relevant to a penalty for a contravention of the BCII Act have been set out in a number of decisions of the Federal Court such that the factors which are to be considered in relation to penalty are now well established; see, eg, Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 per Tracey J at [40]. The relevant considerations include: The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches. The circumstances in which that relevant conduct took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2009] FMCA 1248">In relation to the relevance of prior contraventions the respondent's submissions were: "20. The respondents submit the following principle should be applied in the Court's consideration of prior contraventions: a. prior contraventions are relevant and may justify heavier sentence than may otherwise be imposed but, in the absence of statute, they cannot lead to the imposition of a penalty that is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence: see Veen v The Queen (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14 ; [1988] 164 CLR 465 at 477 - 478; b. prior contraventions of a different statute and/or of a different character should not be considered as relevant prior contraventions or relevant prior conduct: see Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v CFMEU [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at 390 and Stuart-Mahoney v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1426 at [44] ; c. prior contraventions of another autonomous division and/or branch of the first respondent should not be taken into account: see Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v CFMEU [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at 390 and Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 173 IR 189 at [63] ; d. conduct engaged in prior to 3 October 2006 and for which a contravention was not recorded until 3 October 2006 is not a prior contravention: see Alfred v Walter Construction Group Ltd [2005] FCA 497 at 13; e. if conduct prior to 3 October 2006 for which a contravention was not recorded prior to 3 October 2006, is taken into account it is to be given less weight than a prior contravention: see R v McInerney (1986) 42 SASR 111 at 113 and 124; f. In relation to the second respondent, the only prior contraventions which are relevant are those which relate to his conduct (although it is noted in this case the application does not seek a penalty to be imposed on the second respondent). 21. In Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v CFMEU (Supra) the Supreme Court of Western Australian in fixing a penalty for unlawful industrial action in contravention of s38 of the BCII Act, was referred to eight proceedings against the CFMEU over the previous 6 years. A penalty unit is an amount of $110 [7] and under s.38 of the BCII Act the maximum penalty for each contravention thereof by the first respondent is $110,000. [8] 
 Approach to penalty proceedings 
 The principles that should be applied in the approach to penalty proceedings such as the matter before the Court were not in dispute. The factors relevant to a penalty for a contravention of the BCII Act have been set out in decisions of the Federal Court so that the factors which are to be considered, in relation to penalty, are now well established; see, eg, Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 per Tracey J at [40] and citations therein. As Tracey J observed in Stuart-Mahoney at [40], the relevant considerations include: The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches. The circumstances in which that relevant conduct took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2009] FCA 1040">There are various considerations that may be relevant in determining an appropriate penalty for a contravention of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act . They include: 
(a) the circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place;
 
(b) the nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches, including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate disregard of the applicable law; 
 
(c) the consequences of the contravening conduct, including the nature and extent of any loss or damage sustained as a result;
 
(d) where more than one contravention of the Act is involved, whether the contraventions are properly seen as distinct or whether they arise out of the one course of conduct;
 
(e) whether the respondent has previously been found to have engaged in similar unlawful conduct; and
 
(f) the need for specific and general deterrence. See Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61 , at 69 [40] per Tracey J and Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at [7] - [8] per Branson J, both of which have been cited with approval. These factors are relevant in this case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2009] FCAFC 120">42 His Honour then proceeded to deal with the factors identified by Tracey J in Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2008) 177 IR 61 ; [2008] FCA 1426 at [40] , as relevant to the determination of the appropriate penalty for contravention of the BCII Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2009] FCA 865">Whilst the discretion is at large and informed by the particular circumstances of a contravention, the discretion should be exercised broadly according to settled principle which nevertheless recognises the important flexibility necessary to adapt the exercise of the discretion to particular conduct, the contextual circumstances of that conduct and any other matter relevant to the exercise of the discretion. Judges of this Court have sought to isolate principles or criteria informing the exercise of the discretion to impose a pecuniary penalty and the quantum of the penalty. The observations of Branson J in Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No. 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at [8] are well known and have been applied regularly in this Court (some examples of which are Australian Nursing Federation v Alcheringa Hostel Inc. (2004) 138 IR 122 per Ryan J at [44]; Alfred v Walter Construction Group Limited [2005] FCA 497 per Branson J at [10]; Employment Advocate v Barclay Mowlem Construction Ltd (2005) 139 IR 237 per Branson J at [4]; Hadgkiss v Blevin [2004] FCA 917 per Conti J at [3]; Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 per Tracey J and Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 per Tracey J at [39]; McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No. 4) [2006] FCA 1302 ; (2006) 158 IR 181 at [92] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2009] FMCA 746">In assessing penalty in relation to contraventions of a civil penalty provision regard must be had to the objects of the relevant legislation. [29] This principle has been particularly applied both before this Court and the Federal Court in relation to workplace relations legislation where civil penalty provisions have been contravened. [30] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2009] FCA 787">The factors relevant to a penalty for a contravention of the Act have been thoroughly discussed by this Court; see, eg, Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 per Tracey J at [40] and citations therein. As Tracey J observed in Stuart-Mahoney at [40], the relevant considerations include: The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches. The circumstances in which that relevant conduct took place.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs28" from="[2009] FCA 548">Branches, Divisions, officers and representatives of the first defendant are involved in dealings with employers in relation to industrial matters every day. It is inappropriate to take account of conduct of the first defendant through various Branches, Divisions and officers or representatives that is of a different character than the contravening conduct in question and are contraventions of different legislation. 

 
It was said that the following passage from the judgment of Tracey J in Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 , [44] was authority for much the same proposition:
 
 This consideration is derived from the decision of Branson J in Coal &amp; Allied Operations. In the present case, the applicant invites the Court to have regard to previous contraventions by the CFMEU of the WR Act in determining the appropriate penalty for the CFMEU's contraventions of the BCII Act. Similar previous conduct demonstrates that the respondent has a history of engaging in the particular conduct in question, that the penalties previously imposed were insufficient to deter the respondent from re-engaging in that conduct and that the respondent has failed to take adequate steps to prevent further contraventions. October 2004: Contravention of s 170NC of the WR Act: Martino v CFMEU and Maher (unreported, Magistrates Court of Victoria, 10 May 2006). May 2005: Contravention of s 298SC(c), and s 170NC, of the WR Act: Cruse v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1267. October 2005: Contravention of ss 38 and 43 of the BCII Act: Stuart-Mahoney v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1426. February 2006: Contravention of s 43 of the BCII Act: Cahill v CFMEU (No 3) [2009] FCA 52. 

In each of the above instances, the Union was found to have contravened the provision or provisions referred to.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2009] FMCA 272">Although prior contraventions are self-evidently a relevant matter to be taken into consideration, much of the parties' submissions involved this question and it is for this reason that I deal with it separately. Once again, this is an area in which there is a developing field of authority. The remarks of Le Miere J in Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 ("Leighton Contractors") have, it seems to me, been somewhat qualified by the subsequent observations of Tracey J in Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 at [44] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs30" from="[2009] FMCA 236">In Stuart Mahoney v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1426 at [39] and [40] Justice Tracey set out the potentially relevant considerations for determining the appropriate penalty for a contravention of the BCII Act. Those paras provide: "39 In Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 I set out a non-exhaustive range of considerations to which regard may be had in determining whether conduct calls for a penalty, and if so, the amount of such penalty. These considerations were derived from a number of decisions of this Court including Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd [1991] HCA 7 ; [1991] ATPR 52 ,135 (41-076) (which concerned contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)) and Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 (which concerned contraventions of Part XA of the WR Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs31" from="[2009] FCA 299">Within about six months of the relevant events, the Union organised a seminar designed to educate its officials about the effects of the Act. This conduct indicates a desire to avoid repetition of conduct in breach of the Act; see Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 at [53] per Tracey J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs32" from="[2009] FCA 267">In Alfred v Wakelin (No 1) (at [28] to [31]) I referred to certain decisions which identified principles of general application to the question of penalty: 
 28 In Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) (1999) 94 IR 231 ; [1999] FCA 1714 Branson J identified certain factors relevant to the assessment of whether conduct calls for a penalty to be imposed and, if so, the amount of the penalty as including: 

 
 (a) The circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place (including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act);
 (b) Whether the respondent has previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of ...the Act;
 (c) Where more than one contravention ...is involved, whether the various contraventions are properly seen as distinct or whether they arise out of the one course of conduct;
 (d) The consequences of the conduct found to be in contravention ...of the Act;
 (e) The need, in the circumstances, for the protection of industrial freedom of association; and
 (f) The need, in the circumstances, for deterrence. 

 
 29 Observations in other cases are also relevant. In Leighton Contractors (2006) 164 IR 375 ; [2006] WASC 317 at [58] Le Miere J made the following comment when dealing with contraventions of the BCII Act: 

 
 [ 58 ] Contraventions of the Act, whether by individuals or organisations, are always to be treated as a serious matter. The main object of the Act is to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building work to ensure that building work is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole. 

 
 30 In Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 at [58] Tracey J observed as follows: 

 
 ...in light of the statutory purposes of the BCII Act, the need for general deterrence for contraventions of the BCII Act is particularly strong. Penalties must be imposed at a meaningful level if they are to serve as a general deterrent to others who may be disposed to engage in proscribed conduct. 

 
 31 Any penalty must nevertheless be proportionate to the conduct of the individual or organisation in contravention ( Temple v Powell (2008) 173 IR 189 ; [2008] FCA 714 at [58] ). 

 The relationship between the unions and the totality principle
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs33" from="[2009] FCA 243">In Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 at [40] , Tracey J set out a number of "potentially relevant and applicable considerations for determining the appropriate penalty for a contravention of the BCII Act". Those considerations include: The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches. The circumstances in which that relevant conduct took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs34" from="[2009] FMCA 158">Although in the criminal context, to be relevant, a prior offence need not be one of a nature similar to the one for which the defendant is being penalised: R v Armstrong (1996) 1 Qd R 316 at 319, it has been held, when considering breaches of civil penalty provisions of particular industrial relations legislation, that it is inappropriate to take account of contraventions of other legislation which were different in character from the contravening conduct in question: Leighton Contractors v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at 390 [67] . Later, in Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No.3) [2008] FCA 1426 Tracey J said: In the present case, the applicant invites the Court to have regard to previous contraventions by the CFMEU of the WR Act in determining the appropriate penalty for the CFMEU's contraventions of the BCII Act. Similar previous conduct demonstrates that the respondent has a history of engaging in the particular conduct in question, that the penalties previously imposed were insufficient to deter the respondent from re-engaging in that conduct and that the respondent has failed to take adequate steps to prevent further contraventions. Conduct which is of a different character does not assist this assessment see: Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Constructions, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at [67] . Similar conduct which has been found to contravene other legislative provisions will have potential relevance. In this case, any previous contraventions of the provisions of Part 9 of the WR Act which relate to unlawful industrial action and coercion are relevant in determining the appropriate penalty. (at [44]) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs35" from="[2008] FMCA 1392">Based on a series of decided cases in the Federal Court and this Court [53] there does not appear to be a dispute about the relevant considerations for assessment of penalty, which are as follows: the nature and extent of the conduct which led to the contraventions; the circumstances of the conduct (including deliberate defiance or disregard of the WR Act ); relevant record of civil penalty contraventions; whether the contraventions are distinct or arise from a single course of conduct; the consequences of the contravening conduct; deterrence, both general and specific; the objects of the WR Act ; the size and financial resources of the contravener; co-operation with regulatory authorities; the contravener's contrition; the size of the prescribed penalty, and any recent increases to that prescription; and the totality principle. [54] The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the contraventions
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs36" from="[2008] FMCA 1435">It is now becoming increasingly apparent that there are a number of potentially relevant and applicable considerations for determining considerations as to penalty in cases such as these. They have been summarised yet again more recently by Tracey J in Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 (" Stuart-Mahoney v CFMEU ") at [40] (and noting the cases therein cited). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs37" from="[2008] FCA 1455">30 In Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 at [58] Tracey J observed as follows:
 ...in light of the statutory purposes of the BCII Act, the need for general deterrence for contraventions of the BCII Act is particularly strong. Penalties must be imposed at a meaningful level if they are to serve as a general deterrent to others who may be disposed to engage in proscribed conduct. </sentence>
