 (2) a court will not approve an agreement if its terms are unclear: Re United Medical Protection (No 4) [2002] NSWSC 844 ; (2002) 20 ACLC 1 ,647;
 (3) the role of the Court is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator's proposal. Its role is not to develop some alternative proposal which might seem preferable: Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd [1998] NSWSC 596 ; (1998) 16 ACLC 1 ,642;
 (4) in reviewing the liquidator's proposal, the task of the Court is: 
 
 
 
 
 [not] to reconsider all of the issues which have been weighed up by the liquidator in developing the proposal, and to substitute its determination for his in ... a hearing de novo [but] ... simply to review the liquidator's proposal, paying due regard to his or her commercial judgment and knowledge of all of the circumstances of the liquidation, satisfying itself there is no error of law or ground for suspecting bad faith or impropriety, and weighing up whether there is any good reason to intervene in terms of the "expeditious and beneficial administration" of the winding up. 
 
 
 
 
 See ASC Timber at 1,650; see also Re Gate Gourmet Australia Pty Ltd (in liq) [2005] NSWSC 392 ; (2005) 23 ACLC 834 at [10] and Warne v GDK Financial Solutions; Peridon Village Nominees [2006] FCA 1805 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 1 ,019 at [60]. The Court's approval is not an endorsement of the proposed agreement but is merely a permission for the liquidator to exercise his or her own commercial judgment in the matter;
 (5) further, in judging whether or not a liquidator should be given permission to enter into a funding agreement (whether retrospective or not), it is important to ensure, inter alia, that the entity or person providing the funding is not given a benefit disproportionate to the risk undertaken in light of the funding that is promised or a "grossly excessive profit": Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd [2003] NSWCA 71 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 1 ,347 at [11] and Re ACN 076 673 875 Ltd (2002) 20 ACLC 1 ,551 at [28];
 (6) generally, the Court grants approval under s 477(2B) of the Act only where the transaction is the proper realisation of the assets of the company or otherwise assists in the winding up of the company: GDK Financial Solutions at [58] and the cases cited therein.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] VSC 257">14 In Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deakin Financial Services Pty Ltd [28] Finkelstein J held that the predecessor to FOS, (FICS), had contracted with its members to the general effect that the members would be bound by the FICS rules that established the dispute resolution scheme as amended from time to time and that the private contract between them was the source of the power and authority for FICS to hear and determine complaints against the members.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] NSWSC 950">29 However the defence then goes on to assert in paragraph 7 that the first plaintiff procured the defendants' execution of the DGI by its misleading and deceptive conduct, breaching ss 51A, and 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). It is asserted that the first plaintiff failed to disclose at or around the time that it induced the guarantors to enter into the DGI that it was insolvent or that it was about to become insolvent, and that it was unlikely to be in a position to meet in full its contractual obligations to the mortgagor under the mortgage and loan facility or to the guarantors under the DGI. This assertion of misleading and deceptive conduct is directed only at the first plaintiff and not Equity Trustees. Mr Carroll nevertheless submits the two plaintiffs were joint promisees and that a defence available against one joint promisee would defeat the claim brought by the other. Mr Carroll cited the dicta of Finkelstein J in Financial Industry Complaints Service Limited v Deakin Financial Services Pty Limited (2006) FCA 1805 at [67] in support of this submission. Mr Condon who appeared before me in the interests of the second plaintiff submitted otherwise, relying upon the decision of Branson J in Krambousanos v Jedda Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 64 FCR 348. Mr Condon referred me to the decision in Brewer v Westminster Bank Ltd [1952] 2 All ER 650 which may tend to support Mr Carroll's submission, but Mr Condon also referred to later cases in which Brewer was not followed: Ardern v Bank of New South Wales [1956] VicLawRp 87 ; [1956] VLR 569 and Catlin v Cyprus Finance Corporation (London) Ltd [1983] QB 759. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] VSC 7">6 Section 912A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) requires a financial planner, as a condition of the obtaining of a financial services licence, to be a member of an external dispute resolution scheme that is approved by ASIC and that covers complaints against the licensee made by retail clients in connection with the provision of financial services covered by the licence. [1] The dispute resolution scheme conducted by FICS answers that description. [2] The rules of the scheme have been amended from time to time. It is common ground that the rules under which the complaint by the Norrises against Wealthcare fell to be determined were the rules as promulgated in a document dated 1 January 2005 published by FICS. [3] The history and nature of the scheme, and the effect of the main amendments made to the constitution and rules of FICS up to 2002, are described in detail by Finkelstein J in Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deakin Financial Services Pty Ltd [4] . In that case, as Wealthcare itself submits, Finkelstein J found that the external facts established the existence of a contract between Deakin and FICS to the general effect that Deakin would be bound by the FICS rules that established a dispute resolution scheme as amended from time to time; and that this private contract --- not any statutory provision --- was the source of the power and authority of FICS to hear and determine complaints against Deakin. [5] Despite the passage of time and further amendment of the rules, Wealthcare does not suggest that the facts surrounding the relationship between itself and FICS are distinguishable in any relevant way from the facts surrounding the relationship between Deakin and FICS which were considered and ruled upon by Finkelstein J. </sentence>

 AAM contends also that the discontinuance of court proceedings denies to it some juridical benefits which it could not raise before FICS. He referred to the decision of Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deacon Financial Services Pty Ltd [5] . See Re Sailport Pty Ltd ; [3] Wickham v Bells Securities Pty Ltd. [4] But AAM asserts that the condition should also preclude the claimants intended approach to FICS. The court should therefore grant leave, if it can without injustice to the defendant, but in doing so should be careful to see that the defendant is not deprived of some advantage which he has already gained..." [2] 
 
 [4] The claim by each of the claimants is virtually the same. The general principle on which questions of this type are resolved was expressed in Covell Matthews &amp; Partners v French Wools Ltd [1] in the following terms:- 
 
"...the court will, normally at any rate, allow a plaintiff to discontinue if he wants to, provided that no injustice will be caused to the defendant.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] SASC 111">Part 7.9 of the Corporations Act is concerned with financial product disclosure. As was observed by Finkelstein J in Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deakin Financial Services Pty Ltd , [60] "financial product" is defined by reference to a general definition (section 763A) , some specific inclusions (section 764A) and specific exclusions (section 765A). Section 762A establishes that a product may be included under either the general or specific inclusions but the specific exclusions have overriding force. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] AATA 62">This decision was applied in Norths Ltd v McCaughan Dyson Capel Cure Ltd (1988) 12 ACLR 739 in relation to a dispute between members of the Australian Stock Exchange Ltd, a company limited by guarantee, whose articles of association provided that disputes between members should be referred to arbitration before a sub-committee of the board of directors. In view of these cases, it is clear that s 140 does not create a statutory contract obliging Deakin to submit to FICS' jurisdiction with respect to disputes with its clients. " [333]  In light of s 140 of the Corporations Act , a contract is to be found between a company and each of its members by virtue of the Constitution and Rules of the EDR scheme when it is conducted by an incorporated body. [331] That contract is not, however, a sufficient basis on which to find that the members of an EDR scheme are obliged to submit to its jurisdiction with respect to disputes with its clients, retail or otherwise. In Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deakin Financial Services Pty Ltd , [332] Finkelstein J reviewed the authorities and concluded:
 
" ... the authorities indicate that although the constitution is a deemed contract it is nevertheless not possible by this contract to do everything that can be done by a private contract. In particular, a company cannot by its constitution enter into what is in effect a commercial arrangement with its members. 
 
 The first group of cases to which I will refer hold that a company cannot impose a financial obligation on a member in addition to his obligation to pay up the amount due on his shares. 260. In the case before him, Finkelstein J concluded that:
 
" In my view, the external facts establish the existence of a contract between Deakin and FICS to the general effect that Deakin would be bound by FICS' rules that establish its dispute resolution scheme. The external facts are, on the one hand, Deakin's application for membership of FICS and its payment of the applicable membership fee (conduct that might be described as an offer to contract) and, on the other hand, the acceptance by FICS of Deakin's application for membership and the entry of Deakin as a Category E member in FICS' register of members (the acceptance of the offer). The contract came into existence no later than 27 April 2000, the day on which Deakin became a member of FICS. The rules which Deakin agreed to be bound by were the rules in force at the time of the contract, namely the 1999 rules. " [335]  The consent may be ad hoc if supported by consideration or there may be a term that the contract may be altered in accordance with changes made to the constitution or the rules. Even if the 'special contract' contains a power of variation it is unlikely that the power will permit a variation that would retrospectively avoid a breach of contract or prevent the doing of an act which is a right conferred by the contract. " [334] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] NSWSC 1437">60 It must be said, however, that at this stage of the proceedings, a number of the so-called common issues outlined by Mr Abadee are matters about which Mr Robinson says that there is no contest. Included amongst these are that the promissory notes were financial products. He also points to the decision of Finkelstein J in Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deakin Financial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1805 ; (2006) 60 ACSR 372 , which has already elucidated what is a "retail investor" and "investment advice".</sentence>

 (2) a court will not approve an agreement if its terms are unclear: Re United Medical Protection (No 4) [2002] NSWSC 844 ; (2002) 20 ACLC 1 ,647;
 (3) the role of the Court is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator's proposal. Its role is not to develop some alternative proposal which might seem preferable: Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd [1998] NSWSC 596 ; (1998) 16 ACLC 1 ,642;
 (4) in reviewing the liquidator's proposal, the task of the Court is: 
 
 
 "[not] to reconsider all of the issues which have been weighed up by the liquidator in developing the proposal, and to substitute its determination for his in....a hearing de novo [but]... simply to review the liquidator's proposal, paying due regard to his or her commercial judgment and knowledge of all of the circumstances of the liquidation, satisfying itself there is no error of law or ground for suspecting bad faith or impropriety, and weighing up whether there is any good reason to intervene in terms of the "expeditious and beneficial administration" of the winding up.

The Court's approval is not an endorsement of the proposed agreement but is merely a permission for the liquidator to exercise his or her own commercial judgment in the matter;
 (5) further, in judging whether or not a liquidator should be given permission to enter into a funding agreement (whether retrospective or not), it is important to ensure, inter alia, that the entity or person providing the funding is not given a benefit disproportionate to the risk undertaken in light of the funding that is promised or a "grossly excessive profit": Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd [2003] NSWCA 71 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 1 ,347 at [11] and Re ACN 076 673 875 Ltd [2002] NSWSC 844 ; (2002) 20 ACLC 1 ,551 at [28]; 
 (6) generally, the Court grants approval under s 477(2B) of the Act only where the transaction is the proper realisation of the assets of the company or otherwise assists in the winding up of the company: GDK Financial Solutions at [58] and the cases cited therein. </sentence>

44 It will be observed that s 601MB(1) operates only on a contract to subscribe for an interest in a managed investment scheme. The definition of a managed investment scheme is found in s 9. The potential availability of s 601MB is based on the assumption that the Ann Street Development is a scheme that satisfies the definition. I have been asked to accept this assumption, at least for the time being. I think that is an appropriate course if for no other reason than that there are two decisions (including one of my own) in which it has been held that an arrangement that is in all material respects the same as the Ann Street Development is a managed investment scheme. The decisions are ASIC v Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd [2004] WASC 241 ; (2004) 52 ACSR 168 and Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deakin Financial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1805 ; (2006) 60 ACSR 372. </sentence>

70 Insofar as both of the definitions refer to a person in accordance with whose instructions or wishes the directors are accustomed to act, I should note the following well settled principles:
 
 
 (i) though the purpose of the definition is to identify those persons, other than professional advisers, who have real influence in, or indeed control of, the corporate affairs of a company, it is not necessary that such influence or control should be exercised over the whole field of its corporate activities: Secretary of State of Trade and Industry v Deverell [2001] Ch 340 at 354; and 
 
 (ii) the influence or control exercised by a shadow director may be strategic in character, defining the context in which, or conditions upon which, the company operates, or else contriving the transactions of significance to the company: Australian Securities Commission v A S Nominees Ltd [1995] FCA 1663 ; (1995) 133 ALR 1 at 52-53.
