<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWCA 325">8 The respondent then appealed to the Federal Court under s 46 of that Act; and on 23 November 2006, Buchanan J held that the Tribunal's decision was vitiated by errors of law and he reinstated the respondent's decision: Stevedoring Employees Retirement Fund Pty Ltd v Gilberg [2006] FCA 1590. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] NSWSC 1318">36 SERF rejected the claim. It gave reasons. Those reasons are set out in a letter dated 13 September 2007 from its solicitors, Mallesons Stephen Jaques, to Firths. In substance, SERF said, having regard, among other things, to the wording of the rules and the decision of Buchanan J ( Stevedoring Employees Retirement Fund Pty Ltd v Gilberg [2006] FCA 1590) , the trustee had no power to reconsider its earlier decision. SERF's view was that, "the TPD determination process has been exhausted in so far as [Mr Gilberg] is concerned". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] SCTA 133">The Complainant has argued that Dr JM's opinion should be discounted because it goes against the consensus of the other medical reports, in that Dr JM does not consider him to be unfit for work as a stevedore. The ability of the Trustee (and therefore the Tribunal) to consider the earlier medical evidence, once an additional medical practitioner is appointed under paragraph 17(d) was considered by the Federal Court in Stevedoring Employees Retirement Fund Pty Ltd v Gilberg [2006] FCA 1590 (23 November 2006), another case where an additional medical practitioner had been appointed because of a division of opinion. In that case, the Trustee had appealed against a decision of the Tribunal.
  It is the view of the Tribunal that the effect of the Trust Deed governing the Fund and of the Federal Court decision in Stevedoring Employees Retirement Fund Pty Ltd v Gilberg [2006] FCA 1590 (23 November 2006), discussed below, is that Dr JM came within s18(1)(d) of the Complaints Act and was, therefore, required to be joined as a party. That section states that a party to a complaint under s14 is, if the subject of the complaint relates to a disability benefit and the Tribunal decides that a person other than a trustee or insurer is responsible for determining either or both of the existence and the extent of the disability - that person.
