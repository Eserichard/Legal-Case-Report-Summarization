<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 945">The respondent claimed that the applicant had "abandoned" this element of his claim by the time of the hearing before the Tribunal. In this regard I note what was said in SZEIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798 at paragraph 34 per Bennett J: "A claim made to the Department and referred to in the delegate's decision would ordinarily be before the Tribunal, however where a claim has been made to the delegate and not advanced at all before the Tribunal, and does not arise from the material before the Tribunal, the Tribunal is entitled to assume that the claim is no longer made. The Tribunal is conducting a review of the delegate's decision, but on the basis of the claims advanced and materials before the Tribunal. If a claim does not so arise and is abandoned , especially where the applicant's are legally represented, the Tribunal is entitled to take the view that the applicant's do not make the claim, or a claim based on that claim.

 [62] Whatever the scope of the Tribunal's obligations it is not required to consider criteria for an application never made. ... 

 
In MZXLB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1588 at [14] , Finkelstein J referred to NABE and observed that " (t)here is no precise standard for determining when an issue is 'raised squarely', but it is clear the tribunal is obliged to consider any claim that is apparent on the face of the material before it ". See also: SZEIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798 at [30] to [31] and [56] to [57] per Bennett J; SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 599 ; Kasupene v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1609. That which is not to be permitted is for a claimant to " reformulate his claims on an ex post facto basis ": SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [23] , 171 FCR 134 at 140 per Gilmour J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1592">The authority for this proposition comes from two decisions of the Federal Court on appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court. In each case, coincidentally, they are decisions of Bennett J. In SZEIV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [10] her Honour held, at [34]: 
 Where a claim has been made to the delegate and not advanced at all before the Tribunal and does not arise from the material before the Tribunal, the Tribunal is entitled to assume that the claim is no longer made. The Tribunal is conducting a review of the delegate's decision, but on the basis of the claims advanced and materials before the Tribunal. If a claim does not so arise and is abandoned, especially where the applicants are legally represented, the Tribunal is entitled to take the view that the applicant's do not make that claim or a case based on that claim [11] .

  See also SZGLU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [12] at [20] where her Honour said: The Tribunal is conducting a review of the delegate's decision, but that review is conducted on the basis of the claims advanced in materials before the Tribunal(SZEIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798 at [34] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1654">The Tribunal noted that this differed significantly with what was in the protection visa application, but accepted (albeit with serious reservations) that these incidents had occurred as had been described by the applicant at the hearing. 
 
 By the time of the hearing, therefore, what was left of the applicant's original claim that she had been raped on a number of occasions, were the incidents relating to being touched on the hand (albeit in a sexual manner) and the unsuccessful attempt to enter her house. 
 
 I note the Minister's reference to what was said by Bennett J. in SZEIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798 at [34] . 
 
 
 
 "A claim made to the Department and referred to in the delegate's decision would ordinarily be before the Tribunal, however where a claim has been made to the delegate and not advanced at all before the Tribunal, and does not arise from the material before the Tribunal, the Tribunal is entitled to assume that the claim is no longer made.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 1237">
 NABE is not authority for the proposition that the Tribunal is required to consider a claim not made before it. If a claim does not arise, or is not advanced, the Tribunal is entitled to take the view (as it has done in the present case) that the applicant did not make the claim now asserted in the Court. This is especially so where, as in the present case, the applicant was legally represented: see SZEIV v MIMIA [2006] FCA 1798. 
 At no time did the applicant advance a claim for persecution on two distinct bases, one on the basis of his past employment with NARTO and a separate claim on the basis he was a member (in the sense that he belonged to a union). Consequently, the Tribunal was not obliged to consider such distinct claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 1495">
 
 28. In the present case, it is understandable that the applicant might have thought that he was being asked to recount the most immediate incident leading to his departure from his home town and Nepal. I cannot read the Tribunal's description of the hearing as allowing it to ignore other relevant parts of the applicant's history which might also explain the particular risks which might face him at the hands of Maoists if he returned to Nepal. I am not persuaded that it was open to the present Tribunal to conclude that the applicant did not rely upon the whole of the history presented with his visa application. I would not arrive at the same conclusions as did Bennett J in SZEIV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798 at [27] - [34]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FMCA 1377">I was also referred to a decision by Bennett J in SZEIV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2006) FCA 1798 where at [28]---[34] her Honour refers to the authorities and concluded at [34]: 
 
 
 
 A claim made to the Department and referred to in the Delegate's decision would, ordinarily, be before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FMCA 754">By the time of the hearing, therefore, what was left of the applicant's original claim that she had been raped on a number of occasions, were the incidents relating to being touched on the hand (albeit in a sexual manner) and the unsuccessful attempt to enter her house. 21. I note the Minister's reference to what was said by Bennett J. in SZEIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798 at [34] . 
 
 
 "A claim made to the Department and referred to in the delegate's decision would ordinarily be before the Tribunal, however where a claim has been made to the delegate and not advanced at all before the Tribunal, and does not arise from the material before the Tribunal, the Tribunal is entitled to assume that the claim is no longer made. The Tribunal is conducting a review of the delegate's decision, but on the basis of the claims advanced and materials before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 622">19 A claim made to the first respondent and referred to in the delegate's decision would, ordinarily, be before the Tribunal. However, where a claim has been made to the delegate and not advanced at all before the Tribunal and does not arise from the material before the Tribunal, the Tribunal is entitled to assume that the claim is no longer made. The Tribunal is conducting a review of the delegate's decision but on the basis of the claims advanced and materials before the Tribunal. If a claim does not so arise and is abandoned, the Tribunal is entitled to take the view that the appellant did not make that claim or a case based on that claim: SZEIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798 per Bennett J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCA 178">2 The Federal Magistrate dismissed the review application as an abuse of process under r 13.10(c) of the Federal Magistrate Court Rules 2001 , and ordered the applicant to pay the costs of the first respondent. His Honour's reasons also indicate that he dismissed the application because he did not have the jurisdiction to entertain it, although his order of 26 September 2006 is confined to the abuse of process determination. 3 The parties proceeded on the basis that, as the application to the Federal Magistrates Court was determined summarily as an abuse of process, it is an interlocutory judgment: see Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 78 ALJR 177 ; SYWB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 402 at [48] ; MZWHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 491 ; Rana v University of South Australia [2004] FCA 559 ; (2004) 136 FCR 344 at [8] - [15]; SZEIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798. The nature of the present application, being an application for leave to appeal, appears to recognise that position: see s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the FCA). By way of contrast, an appeal lies as of right from a final decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: see s 24(1)(d) of the FCA.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 363">20 The Tribunal is conducting a review of the Delegate's decision but that review is conducted on the basis of the claims advanced and materials before the Tribunal ( SZEIV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798 at [34] ). While the Tribunal is obliged, in certain circumstances, to review claims not expressly advanced at the hearing ( NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at [58] and [68]), if a claim raised before the Delegate is abandoned before the Tribunal, it is entitled to take the view that the applicant does not make that claim or a case based on that claim ( SZEIV at [34]). </sentence>
