<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 285">Although the position is not clear, I am inclined to the view that the reference to interlocutory orders in O 35 r 7(2)(c) should not be treated as including an order that proceedings be dismissed. To treat such an order in that way would completely undermine its effect. Tamberlin J appears to have taken that view in his decision in Kullilli People # 2 and Kullilli People #3 v State of Queensland &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 512 at [16] . His Honour did not dispose of the case on that basis. He rather disposed of it upon a discretionary basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 555">Nevertheless, treating the application to vary the second part of the orders of 18 March 2008 as an independent motion, the governing principles it was suggested are dealt with in the cases examining O 35 r 7(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules . It was submitted that the discretion to vary or set aside an order pursuant to O 35 r 7(2) of the Federal Court Rules will only be exercised in exceptional circumstances: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Black on White Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 363 ; (2004) 138 FCR 314 per Spender J at [14]-[16]; Kullilli People No. 2 and Kullilli People No 3 v Queensland [2007] FCA 512 per Tamberlin J at [17]; Dudzinski v Centrelink [2003] FCA 308 per Spender J at [11]; Paras v Public Service Body Head of Department of Infrastructure (No 2) (2006) 152 IR 352 per Young J at [4]; Wati v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 per curiam at 549-552. </sentence>
