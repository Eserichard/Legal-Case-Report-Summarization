<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 33">So expressed, however, the phraseology has also attracted reservation. The formula of a " proper, genuine and realistic consideration ", it has been said, " creates a kind of general warrant, invoking language of indefinite and subjective application, in which the procedural and substantive merits of any Tribunal decision can be scrutinized ": Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Anthonypillai [2001] FCA 274 at [65] , [2001] FCA 274 ; 106 FCR 426 at 442 per Heerey, Goldberg and Weinberg JJ. Most recently, in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJSS [2010] HCA 48 , 273 ALR 122 an appeal was allowed from a decision of the Federal Court. It was there contended that there had been a failure to " give proper, genuine and realistic evaluation " to objective credible material where it was said that such material had been given " no weight ". French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ concluded that the decision appealed from " depended on the Federal Court reviewing the factual findings of the Tribunal rather than the process by which it arrived at its conclusions ": [2010] HCA 48 at [36] , [2010] HCA 48 ; 273 ALR 122 at 131. The formula, it has been said, " operates as an invitation to Courts to enter on the merits of administrative decision-making ": Lawyers for Forests Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2009] FCA 330 at [37] , [2009] FCA 330 ; 165 LGERA 203 at 220 per Tracey J. See also: WAEH of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 364 at [12] to [13] per Wilcox, Nicholson and Downes JJ; Anderson v Director-General of the Department of Environmental and Climate Change [2008] NSWCA 337 at [51] to [60] [2008] NSWCA 337 ; [2008] NSWCA 337 ; , 251 ALR 633 at 648 to 651 per Tobias JA (Spigelman CJ and Macfarlan J agreeing).

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCAFC 21">Whether or not the Manual identifies considerations going beyond those that must be taken into account when making a decision under s 116, those considerations which must be taken into account when making such a decision include " the circumstances in which the ground for cancellation arose ". Counsel for the Respondent Minister did not contend to the contrary. Consideration of a matter which must be taken into account requires that the matter be " really and genuinely " considered and requires " an active intellectual process ": cf. NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 at [212] , [2005] FCAFC 134 ; 147 FCR 51 at 92 to 93 per Madgwick J (Conti J agreeing at [227] to [230]). Whilst care must be exercised to avoid trespassing into the merits of a decision (see: Lawyers for Forests Inc v Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2009] FCA 330 at [37] , [2009] FCA 330 ; 165 LGERA 203 at 219 to 220), there must nevertheless be a " proper, genuine and realistic " consideration of relevant material: Williams v Minister for the Environment and Heritage [2003] FCA 535 at [29] , [2003] FCA 535 ; 74 ALD 124 at 130. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 114">1 The second respondent (Gunns) proposes to build and operate a pulp mill at Bell Bay in Tasmania. When the mill is operative, effluent from the production process is to be discharged into Bass Strait 2.7 km offshore. That discharge may have an adverse effect on an area of Bass Strait that forms part of the Commonwealth marine environment which begins a further 2.9 km offshore. For this reason it was necessary for Gunns to obtain the approval of the first respondent (the Minister) under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (the Act) before undertaking the construction of the mill. The Minister gave his approval on 4 October 2007. The appellant sought judicial review of the Minister's decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1997 (Cth) and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). The primary judge dismissed the application: Lawyers for Forests Inc. v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2009] FCA 330. This appeal is from that decision.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 466">On 9 April 2009 the Court dismissed an application brought by Lawyers for Forests Inc. ("LFF") in which it sought to impugn a decision of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts ("the Minister") to grant conditional approval for the construction of a pulp mill by Gunns Limited ("Gunns") at Bell Bay in Tasmania: see Lawyers for Forests Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2009] FCA 330. I ordered that, if LFF wished to contend that costs should not follow the event, it should file and serve written submissions and that, if it did so, the respondents should file and serve answering submissions. LFF filed written submissions in which it contended that no order for costs should be made or, alternatively, that it should be ordered to pay no more than 70% of the Minister's costs and 40% of Gunns' costs. Both the Minister and Gunns filed submissions in which they sought orders that LFF pay their costs of the proceeding on the basis that they were successful in resisting the application. </sentence>
