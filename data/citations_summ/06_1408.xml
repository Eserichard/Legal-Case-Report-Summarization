<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCAfam 365">Subsequent to the amendments of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) which commenced in July of 2006, Kay J in Godfrey &amp; Sanders (2007) FamCA 102 considered the effect of those amendments on the principles I have just referred to. The case was an appeal from a Federal Magistrate. Dessau J in M v S (2006) FCA 1408 had concluded after extensive examination of the new provisions and explanatory memorandum that it did not alter the position that there was no presumption against or for relocation and no onus on a person wishing to relocate. Kay J came to the same conclusion. The paramount consideration remains the best interests of the child. Equal time
