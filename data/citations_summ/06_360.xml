<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] FCA 392">34 Having regard to the history of the matter and recognising that this proceeding was commenced on 5 December 1996, it is important that the controversy between these parties is resolved as soon as possible. I am not persuaded that it is in the interests of justice that the matter be adjourned. The Respondent Applicant relies upon an affidavit of Mr Andrew Charles which identifies the history of the matter, the preparation of the matter for re-trial, the analysis of the documents in preparation, the arrangements in relation to witnesses and the consequences of any adjournment. I am satisfied that the adjournment of the matter will inflict significant dislocation on the Applicant as it no doubt will upon the Respondents. It is important that the matter proceed to trial as soon as possible. There is a real need or necessity to determine the controversy by trial without any further delay having regard to the history and the field of the issues raised by the litigation. In that regard see Expectation Pty Ltd v PRD Realty Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [2006] FCA 360 , 4 April 2006. </sentence>
