<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 579">Before reaching conclusions on penalty, I will, for convenience, reiterate the substance of the views expressed in Kentwood No 2 on that topic (at [210]-[252]). The same abbreviations have been adopted. DECLARATIONS 
 In Kentwood No 2 (at [210]) I observed that there may be a public interest in the granting of declaratory relief in regulatory proceedings to record the contraventions' seriousness and to explain the basis for the imposition of pecuniary penalties and other relief (see the analysis by Heerey J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v FUELbanc Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 960 ; (2007) 162 FCR 174 (at [46]-[66]) and Warramunda Village Inc v Pryde [2001] FCA 61 ; (2001) 105 FCR 437 (per Gray, Branson and North JJ) (at [12])). A declaration in this case may indicate the importance of compliance with statutory standards, particularly in the employment of low paid and/or vulnerable employees.

"[51] While courts are still reluctant to grant declaratory relief on issues which are theoretical or hypothetical (see Zamir and Woolf, op cit, 117 et seq), the Intertax argument against the grant of declaratory relief is based on a hypothetical fact, indeed a hypothesis upon a hypothesis --- that there will be a prosecution and that such prosecution will result in an acquittal.</sentence>

 Introduction 
 
 This is an application by the plaintiff, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (" ASIC "), for winding-up orders against the second defendant, John West &amp; Associates Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) (" JWA ") and an alleged unregistered managed investment scheme (" the scheme "). In the circumstances of the present case, I consider that it is appropriate to make the declarations sought for the following reasons: &#8722; ASIC, in its capacity as the public regulator of the securities and investments markets in Australia, has a real interest in seeking the declarations. The subject of the proposed declarations concerns matters of public interest, [73] and the grant of declaratory relief serves an important law enforcement purpose; [74] &#8722; the proposed declarations are not abstract or hypothetical. They both formally record the conclusion that the Court has reached, on the evidence, as to the legal consequences of specific conduct of the defendants, [75] and mark the Court's disapproval of the contravening conduct; [76] &#8722; the Court has a substantial body of evidence supporting the findings and conclusions that in turn support the declarations sought by ASIC; [77] &#8722; the defendants engaged in serious and repeated breaches of provisions of the Corporations Act in the conduct of the mortgage investment business and it is right for the Court to so declare. [78] The scheme involved high risks, the extent of which was not disclosed in any proper way to investors. No proper books and records were kept by Mr West and JWA; [79] and &#8722; no embarrassment or legal or practical injustice to non-parties by the declarations being granted has been identified.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 1868">55 The other case is Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Fuelbanc Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 960 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1230. The case involved a petrol payment scheme where subscribers, by paying a joining fee and making upfront contributions of cash and so-called "barter units", were provided with a debit card to which a specified amount was deposited every week to purchase petrol at participating service stations. ASIC alleged that the scheme constituted an unregistered management investment scheme in breach of s 601ED and that the defendants conducted an unlicensed financial services business in breach of s 911A. It sought an order that the scheme be wound-up as well as declarations, injunctions and other ancillary relief. The defendants did not contest the facts upon which ASIC based its claim. Nor did they oppose the orders sought. But because counsel for ASIC could not rule out the possibility of future criminal proceedings against the defendants he drew the court's attention to Intertax Holdings . Heerey J was not troubled by the case. He referred to the "consistent practice" in company cases of courts making declarations of criminal conduct, citing, in particular, Transphere , Sankey v Whitlam and Australian Softwood Forest among other cases. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] QSC 376">Since that decision, the question has been considered by Justice Heery in the Federal Court in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Fuel Bank Australia Limited [2007] FCA 960.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1033">1 On 20 July 2006 Young J made interim orders in relation to an unregistered managed investment scheme known as the FUELbanc scheme. On 29 June 2007 I made final orders, including an order for the winding up the scheme: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v FUELbanc Australia Limited [2007] FCA 960. The present application is brought by Matthew and Timothy McDougall, who are the sixth and seventh defendants and the sons of Stephen McDougall, the fifth defendant. Stephen McDougall was, I have found, the mastermind of the scheme.</sentence>
