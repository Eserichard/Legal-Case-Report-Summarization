243. Although the Full Court in Arnotts contemplated an expert's making assumptions about propositions of law, it is clear from the judgment of French J in Woodside Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [355] and the cases to which he referred that:
 
" generally, it is not for an expert to give evidence as to the application of a legislative provision, as opposed to furnishing evidence from the view point of an economist with respect to what factors can or should be taken into account into consideration or ignored. " [356] 
 
 
244. Whether there is sufficient parity between the assumptions and the findings of fact made by the trier of fact is ultimately a question of fact as explained by the High Court in Paric v John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd : [357] 
 
" It is trite law that for an expert medical opinion to be of any value the facts upon which it is based must be proved by admissible evidence ... But that does not mean that the facts so proved must correspond with complete precision to the proposition on which the opinion is based.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1961">270 As I said in the interlocutory decision in Woodside Energy [2006] FCA 1303 ; 155 FCR 357 at 374, the words "in relation to" and similar terms such as "in respect of" or "in connection with" or just "in" have been considered in many cases and many contexts. All of them indicate a necessary connection between two subject matters which may be activities, events, persons or things. The nature and closeness or remoteness of the connection sufficient to answer the statutory description depends upon its context. The term "in respect of" was said to "[gather] meaning from the context in which it appears ...": Workers' Compensation Board (Qld) v Technical Products Pty Ltd (1988) 165 CLR 642 at 653-4 per Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ. The term "in relation to" has been called a "prepositional phrase" which is "indefinite" and which "subject to any contrary indication derived from its context or drafting history ... requires no more than a relationship whether direct or indirect between two subject matters": O'Grady v Northern Queensland Co Ltd [1990] HCA 16 ; (1990) 169 CLR 356 at 376 (McHugh J). As the present case illustrates the extent of the relationship required depends upon the context in which the words are used. See also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia [2001] FCA 1549 ; (2001) 114 FCR 472 at 482. Context and purpose are everything in the construction of such indefinite phrases as "in relation to". The citation of authorities, a number of which were canvassed in argument, is of limited assistance where they relate to different statutory settings. </sentence>

184 In so concluding, the primary judge relied upon observations in Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374 at 454 [247] ; Re Michael; Ex parte Epic Energy (WA) Nominees Pty Ltd [2002] WASCA 231 ; (2002) 25 WAR 511 at 544 [107] ; Visa International Service Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2003] FCA 977 ; (2003) 131 FCR 300 at 439 [665] and Woodside Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1303 ; 155 FCR 357 at 373 and 374 [52] --- [55]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 1764">175 A similar approach, with which I agree was taken at an interlocutory level in Woodside Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation for the Commonwealth of Australia [2006] FCA 1303 at [52] - [55] per French J (affirmed in [2006] FCA 1375 per Nicholson J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 1475">49 Earlier in this judgment I considered the meaning of 'decision' and 'in connection with' in the context of s 9A(4)(a). The differences between 'in connection with' and 'in relation to' are, as a general proposition, minimal (cf French J in Woodside Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1303). Indeed, related criminal justice process decisions are defined by the fact that there is a 'connection' between a decision and some other event, such as the issue of a warrant. 'In relation to' was explained by McHugh J in O'Grady v Northern Queensland Co Ltd [1990] HCA 16 ; (1990) 169 CLR 356 at 376 in the following terms:
 
 'The prepositional phrase "in relation to" is indefinite. But, subject to any contrary indication derived from its context or drafting history, it requires no more than a relationship, whether direct or indirect, between two subject matters. ' (followed by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Harris v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [2002] FCAFC 226 at [68] ) </sentence>

 On 4 October 2006 French J delivered reasons for judgment in Woodside Energy Limited (ABN 63 005 482 986) v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [2006] FCA 1303. In consequence he made orders having the effect of admitting the evidence of Professors Garnaut and Walker at the trial of the action. The applicant (the Commissioner, who is the respondent in the action) now brings a motion in reliance on O 52 r 10(2) of the Federal Court Rules (FCR) seeking leave to appeal from the judgment of French J. </sentence>
