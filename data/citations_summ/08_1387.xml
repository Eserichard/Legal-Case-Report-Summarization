<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1408">The unqualified submission that there had been no delay attributable to Dr Wenkart was surprising. Rather than being free from criticism, serious criticism can in fact be properly directed at his conduct. Even if the attempts presently being made to re-visit conclusions reached as recently as August 2010 are disregarded, as well as the delay occasioned by the filing of evidence leading to a yet further hearing on 23 November 2010, the following observations of Branson J in Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 1387 when addressing the Cross-Claim should be recalled, namely: 
 
 [18] ... I indicated in my reasons for judgment of 11 April 2008 at [92] why I regarded the option of simply dismissing Mr Pantzer's cross-claim on the basis that it had been instituted prematurely to be undesirable. It seemed to me to be a course likely to result in the institution of yet further litigation between the parties. Although there is no certainty in the fixing of any particular date, it is considered that interest should be ordered on the sum of $173,079.71 for only " part of the period ", that period commencing on 16 September 2008. That was the date of judgment of Branson J resolving an application made by Dr Wenkart to reconsider part of Her Honour's reasons for decision published in April 2008 and the date when Her Honour resolved an application by Mr Pantzer that she withdraw and reconsider part of those same April 2008 reasons: Wenkart v Pantzer, in the matter of Wenkart [2008] FCA 1387. Interest from that date, it is considered, affects an exercise of discretion having regard to two fundamental factors, namely: the fact that there has been a long-running dispute as to the entitlement of Mr Pantzer to monies and the time taken to resolve those claims; and the fact that the resolution of the claims in the present proceeding has not been free of difficulty. 
Also taken into account is a third factor, namely:
 the fact that the Cross-Claim was filed prematurely. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1379">This is not a case in which final orders have been pronounced or one in which a trial on all issues has been completed and the Court has sought the submissions of parties as to what orders should be made consistently with published reasons for judgment. Nonetheless, the approach adopted by Finkelstein J in Nutrasweet provides useful general guidance as to what course I should now adopt: cf Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 1387 at [7] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 866">In September 2008 Branson J thus made orders, including an order that a Registrar " conduct an inquiry to determine the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled from Dr Wenkart that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66 ": Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 1387.  Notwithstanding the order made by Branson J in September 2008 for such an inquiry to be conducted, and the conclusion expressed in the decision giving effect to the inquiry thereafter conducted, it must further be recalled that the September 2008 orders were preceded by Her Honour's decision in April 2008 wherein Her Honour: concluded that as at 31 October 2002 Mr Pantzer was not entitled to " orders in aid " of the 11 March 2002 consent orders made by Beaumont J; declined to dismiss the cross-claim, as Her Honour was then invited to do by Dr Wenkart as " Mr Pantzer could simply institute a fresh application seeking to enforce the charge over the Paddington property " ([2008] FCA 478 at [92]); and proposed the ordering of the inquiry " as a first step " in the " making of appropriate costs orders " to deal with the premature filing of the cross-claim. 
That was the purpose to be served by later ordering the inquiry to be held. It is also to be recalled that in her subsequent decision in September 2008, Branson J:
 expressed a belief that Dr Wenkart accepted that in determining the cross-claim filed by Mr Pantzer " the Court could take into account amounts ... after the date on which the cross-claim was filed " ([2008] FCA 1387 at [18]); and again adverted to her earlier disinclination to simply dismiss the cross-claim because such a course would be " likely to result in the institution of yet further litigation between the parties " and because this " did not seem ... to be in the public interest or in the interests of the parties, particularly having regard to the Court's wide powers to formulate orders for costs ".  It should be noted that, after the April 2008 judgment, both Dr Wenkart and Mr Pantzer applied unsuccessfully to have various paragraphs of the judgment " reconsidered " or " withdrawn ". Her Honour published further reasons for so deciding in a decision published on 16 September 2008: Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 1387. In doing so, Her Honour referred to an exchange between then Senior Counsel for Dr Wenkart and the Court and continued: 
 
 [18] The above exchange caused me to believe that Dr Wenkart accepted that, in determining Mr Pantzer's cross-claim, the Court could take into account amounts to which Mr Pantzer became "legally entitled" from Dr Wenkart within the meaning of the consent orders made by Beaumont J on 11 March 2002 after the date on which the cross-claim was filed --- albeit that he contended that the preferable course would be not to do so. I indicated in my reasons for judgment of 11 April 2008 at [92] why I regarded the option of simply dismissing Mr Pantzer's cross-claim on the basis that it had been instituted prematurely to be undesirable.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1086">The present proceeding arises out of an order made by Branson J in September 2008 that an inquiry be held pursuant to O 39 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules : Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 1387. An inquiry was held and a Certificate subsequently issued by a Deputy District Registrar on 28 May 2009. An " objection " has been taken to this Certificate and the present proceeding before the Court is a " hearing " pursuant to O 39 r 10(3) of the Federal Court Rules .  Counsel on behalf of Mr Pantzer took a more confined view as to the task presently confronting the Court. She maintained that the Certificate should be given such weight that the Court should conclude that the date calculated by the Deputy District Registrar (namely 10 January 2005) was the date on which the 28 day period referred to in the order of Beaumont J as made on 11 March 2002 expired. Counsel on behalf of Mr Pantzer further maintained that the only task confronting the Court when conducting the " hearing " provided for in O 39 r 10 was the task of determining the " weight " to be given to the Certificate . Excluded from consideration, on this approach, was any task of revisiting the orders as made by Branson J or the constraints imposed by Her Honour upon those who were to carry out the " inquiry ". Indeed, on this approach, and given the findings as made by Branson J, the task performed by the Deputy District Registrar was a simple mathematical calculation of amounts and the correlation of expenditure with dates. The confined nature of the current " hearing ", it was contended, was not only dictated by the terms of O 39 r 10 but also by the fact that Branson J had herself been previously asked to revisit the findings she had made and declined to do so in her September 2008 judgment: [2008] FCA 1387.  Subsequent to the publication of those reasons for decision, two Notices of Motion were filed on behalf of Dr Wenkart seeking that further consideration be given by the Court to some of the conclusions then reached. One Notice of Motion was filed on 2 June and another on 5 June 2008. Her Honour dismissed both Motions in September 2008: [2008] FCA 1387. In doing so, Her Honour expressed her conclusions and made orders as follows: 
 
 CONCLUSION 
 

 
 
 [30] The parties have not reached an agreement as to the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled from Dr Wenkart that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding the total amount received by Mr Pantzer as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate. On the approach that I have considered, and continue to consider, it appropriate to adopt, before final orders can be made on Mr Pantzer's cross-claim it is necessary to know when, if at all, Mr Pantzer became entitled to enforce the charge over Dr Wenkart's Paddington property reflected in order 2 of the consent orders made by Beaumont J on 11 March 2002.</sentence>
