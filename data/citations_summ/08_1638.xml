No error is revealed in these circumstances. The Tribunal was entitled to consider the applicant's credibility and then separately turn its consideration to the documentary evidence ( Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZNSP [2010] FCAFC 50 ; [2010] FCAFC 50 ; (2010) 184 FCR 485 at [37] per North and Lander JJ). Complaint: Bias
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 6">The appellant's claim for refugee status has a long and unhappy history. With the assistance of a migration agent he lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship ("the Department") on 30 November 2007, just over a month after he arrived in Australia. On 28 February 2008 a delegate of the Minister refused his application, notifying the appellant the following day. On 20 March 2008 the appellant applied to the second respondent ("the Tribunal") for a review of that decision and on 24 June 2008, after a hearing on 24 April, the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate, although it appears that decision was delivered on 3 July 2008. On 27 January 2009 the Federal Magistrates Court, by consent, ordered that the Tribunal's decision be quashed and remitted the matter to the Tribunal to be determined according to law. On 15 April 2009 a differently constituted tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision after a further hearing but, once again, on 19 October 2009 the Federal Magistrates Court, by consent, ordered that the Tribunal's decision be quashed and remitted the matter again to the Tribunal to be determined according to law. In each case the Minister conceded that the decisions of the respective tribunals had been affected by jurisdictional error, in the first instance when it failed to consider whether China's one child policy, being a law of general application, had a discriminatory impact on the applicant, and in the second, by rejecting corroborative documentary evidence without regard to the principles discussed in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1638 and SZMSJ v Minister for Immigration [2009] FMCA 102. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1132">This evidence was accepted by the learned Federal Magistrate. Although there was some doubt as to the precise date on which the guarantee had been signed the Federal Magistrate found that Ms Mani had gone to the Economix offices and had signed the document. The Federal Magistrate also took into account evidence that Ms Mani had delivered sandwiches to her husband and son at a construction site and had been identified in a bank document which she had signed as the "office manager" in her husband's business as confirming that she was far more familiar with her husband's business activities than she was prepared to admit. The Federal Magistrate considered that the case before him fell into the rare category, described by Finkelstein J in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638 at [23] "where a witness' credit has been so badly destroyed in cross-examination that it is possible to make findings of fact based on that evidence alone and simply disregard any corroborative evidence. " His Honour said (at [27]) that: 
 
 "... I am afraid I just do not believe the applicant. It is not just the fact that she visited Economix with a parrot on her shoulder, which after all the witnesses were most unlikely to forget, but the Westpac documentation and the evidence of Mr Dimech about sandwiches all point to the same conclusion. Because of the way the applicant has herself run her case, denying both guarantees, and I find she signed one of them for a certainty, it seems to me that the finding I make regarding the Economix guarantee properly founds a conclusion that she signed the Transcrete one as well.

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 (Revised from transcript) 
 The matter before the Court is an application for review filed on 
6 April 2010 by Reyhan Mani, whom I shall describe as the applicant, to annul her bankruptcy and to set aside a sequestration order and another order made by Registrar Luxton on 22 October 2009.  In SZGDC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638 at [23] , Finkelstein J observed that cases of this sort of poisoned-well scenario would be rare. What his Honour said was: "There may be circumstances where it is not necessary to pay due regard to corroborative evidence. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FCAFC 50">20 The first respondent relied upon a decision of Finkelstein J in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638. In that case, Finkelstein J said at [23] after considering the dicta of McHugh and Gummow JJ at [49] in Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; 198 ALR 59: 
 That proposition is no doubt true. But the circumstances for its application will be rare indeed. Even experienced applicants can only point to a handful of cases where a witness' credit has been so badly destroyed in cross-examination that it is possible to make findings of fact based on that evidence alone and simply disregard any corroborative evidence. He referred to WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 80 ALD 568.  17 The Federal Magistrate referred to a decision of Finkelstein J in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1638 and said:
 
 
 12. In the instant case the Tribunal did not find that the applicant had lied. It found it difficult to believe a number of assertions that she had made but it did believe others. 38 The RRT would fall into jurisdictional error if, after making an adverse credibility finding, it simply refused to consider the corroborative evidence. Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; 198 ALR 59 does not sanction a practice of disregarding corroborative evidence. It still requires that the corroborative evidence be assessed and weighed in the balance with all the other evidence. Consequently, the observation concerning the dicta of McHugh and Gummow JJ at [49] in Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; 198 ALR 59 made in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638 ; (2008) 105 ALD 25 at [23] is probably misdirected. Those observations addressed the situation where the corroborative evidence was disregarded. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] FMCA 357">As Ms Sirtes submits, the Tribunal disregarded the applicant's attendance at church pursuant to s.91R(3). It did not reject the letter or fail to consider this evidence as in the sense found, for example, in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638 at [27]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] FMCA 247">In the written submissions relied upon by Ms Palmer it is noted that the Tribunal did not simply reject the business card based on its adverse view of the Applicant's credibility. Rather it assessed the document independently and relied on an anomaly contained in the document itself and the Applicant's oral evidence to support its general adverse credibility finding: Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Applicant s20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 per McHugh and Gummow JJ at [49] and SZDGC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638 at [27] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2010] FMCA 110">A further problem with the manner in which the Tribunal has dealt with the Newspaper Article is highlighted by the following passages from SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship : [88] "23 It is only necessary to deal briefly with the second ground. The complaint is that the tribunal failed to "consider the corroborative evidence in the form of the Summons against the husband of the applicant and the Administrative Penalty Order, before making the adverse credibility finding". I take it to be a trite proposition that a decision-maker required to find facts, whether the decision-maker be a judge or an administrative official, must consider the totality of the evidence that bears upon the facts to be found.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2010] FCA 154">The appellant relied on what Finkelstein J had said in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638 at [23] , [24] and [27]. He observed that a decision-maker had to consider any direct evidence of the existence of the facts in issue, together with any corroborative evidence that bore on that issue, and that it would only be a rare case indeed where the exception to the general rule referred to in Applicant S20/2002 198 ALR 59, would operate. He also referred to what Lee and Moore JJ had said in WAIJ v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 80 ALD 568 at 574-575 [27]. There, an applicant for review had complained that the tribunal had failed to have regard to certain documents because it was not convinced that the documents could overcome difficulties with the applicant's evidence. They held that for the exception of a "poisoned well" to apply there would need to be cogent material to support a conclusion that the appellant had lied. Their Honours said that it would not be open to exclude such material as worthless or not worthy of consideration as corroboration of an applicant for review's claims merely because the tribunal would consider it unlikely that the events described by the applicant would occur. They continued:
 
 
 "In such a circumstance the tribunal would be bound to have regard to corroborative material before attempting to reach a conclusion on the applicant's credibility. Failure to do so would provide a determination not carried out according to law and the decision would be affected by jurisdictional error. "

Second Respondent
 
 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Application 
 The critical issue in this case is whether the applicant was so affected by a psychiatric disorder that he was unable to give proper evidence to the Refugee Review Tribunal at two hearings.  Mr Young submitted that the Tribunal placed no weight on the document because it repeated the applicant's claim, in other words, that it corroborated the claim. He submitted that a decision maker must consider the totality of the evidence that bears on the facts to be found, which requires the decision maker to consider any direct evidence together with any corroborative evidence ( SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [27] per Finkelstein J at [23]-[27]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FMCA 1269">On the basis of these inconsistencies in the documents provided by the applicant the Tribunal formed the view that they were not genuine (CB 217 at [85], CB 218 at [89], CB 219 at [91]). However the Tribunal acknowledged that other documents were genuine and relied on the inconsistencies between those documents and the applicant's claims as the basis of rejection (CB 219 at [91]-[93], CB 220 at [96]). I agree with the submission made by Ms Johnson that the Tribunal did not simply reject these particular documents based on its adverse view of the applicant's credibility ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Re; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002; Appellant S106/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 30 ; SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638). Rather the Tribunal member assessed the documents independently and relied upon identified inconsistencies and implausibilities in the documents to support its general adverse credibility finding. Care should be taken when assessing documents in these circumstances. However, care should be exercised as indicated in the decision of SZTGC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638 per Finkelstein J at [27] where His Honour said: This is not a rational approach. Putting to one side the fact that the tribunal misunderstood the appellant's claim, it is false reasoning to find that the corroborative evidence was not authentic because the tribunal without regard to that evidence found the appellant to be dishonest. The tribunal should have had regard to the documents when assessing the appellant's credibility. In that process it might have found the documents not to be authentic. But that would need to have been for independent reasons, unless the appellant's evidence fell into the S 20/2002 category. It plainly did not fall into that category. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FMCA 1200">While the applicant accepted that the Tribunal does not act irrationally it if discounts corroborative evidence on the basis that the applicant's allegations have been rejected as not being credible ( Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59) , it was submitted that such circumstances will only occur in rare cases and the Tribunal cannot simply discount corroborative evidence because it considers the applicant's claim unlikely. In this regard, the applicant referred to the comments of Finkelstein J in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638 ; (2008) 105 ALD 25 where his Honour acknowledged that a party's credibility may be so weakened in cross-examination that any corroborative evidence is given no weight. While accepting this proposition to be true, his Honour continued: But the circumstances for its application will be rare indeed. Even experienced advocates can only point to a handful of cases where a witness' credit has been so badly destroyed in cross-examination that it is possible to make findings of fact based on that evidence alone and simply disregard any corroborative evidence. (at 30-31 [23]) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] FMCA 1217">The applicant stated that original documents would be submitted in the hearing. There are a number of aspects to the claims made in the amended application. First the applicants take issue with the fact that the Tribunal did not believe their claims about what occurred in India, although they " gave all evidence to prove it . " Insofar as the applicants take issue with the Tribunal's fact finding or its findings in relation to their credibility, fact finding and credibility findings are matters for the Tribunal ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v SBAA [2002] FCAFC 195 at [36] , Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham (2000) 74 ALJR 405, [2000] HCA 1). The Tribunal findings were open to it on the material before it for the reasons that it gave. Insofar as it may be intended to submit that the Tribunal did not consider evidence submitted by the applicants, on the contrary, it is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons for decision that it considered the applicants' claims and also their supporting documentation, but for the reasons it gave did not accept the claims and did not accept that the supporting documentation established or supported the claims. It engaged in the necessary consideration of the claimed corroborative material ( SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 105 ALD 25 ; [2008] FCA 1638). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] FMCA 1169">Notwithstanding Kirby J's views, those of McHugh and Gummow JJ have prevailed. But it is, in my view, prudent for Tribunals to bear in mind the views expressed by Finkelstein J in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1638 which were cited positively in SZGYT v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 705 and SZMSB v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 373. His Honour said, at [23]: "There may be circumstances where it is not necessary to pay due regard to corroborative evidence. In Re Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 , McHugh and Gummow JJ said "it is not unknown for a party's credibility to have been so weakened in cross-examination that the Tribunal of fact may well treat what is proffered as corroborative evidence as of no weight because the well has been poisoned beyond redemption.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] FMCA 1143">In SZDGC v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1638 cited positively in SZGYT v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 705 and SZMSB v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 373 Finkelstein J said of the passage from S20 that I have extracted: [23] ...That proposition is no doubt true. But the circumstances for its application will be rare indeed. Even experienced advocates can only point to a handful of cases where a witness' credit has been so badly destroyed in cross-examination that it is possible to make findings of fact based on that evidence alone and simply disregard any corroborative evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2009] FMCA 891">In any event the Tribunal's obligation is to make its determination having regard to " relevant" material in the sense considered in Craig v The State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 and Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at [16] --- [17]. If a Tribunal granted or failed to consider relevant material in a way that affected the exercise of power it would fall into jurisdictional error ( Craig at 179 and Toro Martinez v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 528 at [43] per Rares J). The jurisdictional error considered above can be characterised as a failure by the Tribunal to have regard to such relevant material, being the material before it evidencing the value of independent orders shipped by G Ping in the period between 2006 and early 2007. As discussed, such evidence " bears upon the facts to be found" (see SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 1638 ; (2008) 105 ALD 25 at [23] ) and was " relevant material" in the Craig v South Australia sense (see WAFP , SBAA, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [82] and Martinez at [43]-[51]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2009] FMCA 886">A third factor which Mr Young submits is that Tribunal 3 had already accepted that the applicant has been subject to various acts of past persecution. He submits that at [145] of the decision, Tribunal 3 effectively said that even though there was nothing in the applicant's oral evidence which undermined his claims, it gave the documents no weight. Mr Young also referred to SZDGC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638 per Finkelstein J and SZMSJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 102 per Driver FM.

<sentence id="cs21" from="[2009] FMCA 770">Accordingly, the Tribunal did not comprehensively reject the Applicant's credibility; rather, it accepted the Applicant's claims in a number of important respects. Therefore it follows that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by rejecting the corroborative evidence on the basis of its credibility concerns alone. " 

In SZDGC v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1638 Finkelstein J said at [23] after quoting from Applicant S20/2002 :
 
 "[23] ... That proposition is no doubt true. But the circumstances for its application will be rare indeed. Even experienced applicants can only point to a handful of cases where a witness' credit has been so badly destroyed in cross-examination that it is possible to make findings of fact based upon that evidence alone and simply disregard any corroborative evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2009] FCA 705">His Honour also found that the Tribunal's rejection of the appellant as a witness of credit provided a basis for the rejection of his claims (at [21]). That was not justification, the appellant submitted, for the Tribunal failing to consider corroborative evidence. Reference was made to what Finkelstein J said in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1638 ; (2008) 105 ALD 25 at [27] : 
 [I]t is false reasoning to find that the corroborative evidence was not authentic because the tribunal without regard to that evidence found the appellant to be dishonest. The tribunal should have had regard to the documents when assessing the appellant's credibility. In that process it might have found the documents not to be authentic. But that would need to have been for independent reasons, unless the appellant's evidence fell into the S20/2002 category. It plainly did not fall into that category.

<sentence id="cs23" from="[2009] FMCA 554">Counsel for the Applicant referred the Court to various authorities which stand for the proposition that a decision maker cannot be said to have regard to all of the information to hand without at least really and genuinely giving it consideration and engaging in an intellectual process in respect of that evidence ( NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [212] ; WAFP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 319 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SBAA [2002] FCAFC 195 (" SBAA "); SZKHD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 112 ; SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638).

<sentence id="cs24" from="[2009] FMCA 427">Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the Tribunal should have considered whether government officials in China were capable of being bribed. In support of that submission, counsel for the Applicant referred the Court to SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638 (" SZDGC ") at [42] where Finkelstein J referred to the passage of Allsop J (with whom Spender J agreed), in Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 ; (2001) 194 ALR 244 at [42] , as follows: "The requirement to review the decision under s 414 of the Act requires the tribunal to consider the claims of the applicant. To make a decision without having considered all the claims is to fail to complete the exercise of jurisdiction embarked on. The claim or claims and its or their component integers are considerations made mandatorily relevant by the Act for consideration... It is to be distinguished from errant fact finding. The nature and extent of the task of the tribunal revealed by the terms of the Act... make it clear that the tribunal's statutorily required task is to examine and deal with the claims for asylum made by the applicant.

<sentence id="cs25" from="[2009] FMCA 432">The Federal Court dealt with the issue of the Tribunal's obligation to take into account corroborative evidence in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1638 at [23] to [27]: It is only necessary to deal briefly with the second ground. The complaint is that the tribunal failed to "consider the corroborative evidence in the form of the Summons against the husband of the applicant and the Administrative Penalty Order, before making the adverse credibility finding". I take it to be a trite proposition that a decision-maker required to find facts, whether the decision-maker be a judge or an administrative official, must consider the totality of the evidence that bears upon the facts to be found.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2009] FMCA 412">I have also considered whether it might be argued that the Tribunal erred in its treatment of the baptismal certificate provided by the applicant to support her claims of being a Christian in China [6] . At paragraph 83 of its reasons (CB 119), the Tribunal states that it placed no weight on the baptismal certificate. However, in my view, it is not arguable that the Tribunal fell into the error identified by the Federal Court in SZDGC .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2009] FCA 373">In those supplementary written submissions, in relation to the "no weight" issue, Ms Francois submitted that the relevant authorities held that: It is not irrational, nor is it an error, for a Tribunal to reject, or give no weight to, corroborative evidence without further analysis or reasons, where it has determined an appellant is fabricating a story, provided that there is cogent evidence to support such adverse findings: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex Parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at [12] and [49] ; WAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 912 at [34] --- [36] ; WAJQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1580 at [21] and see also SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 105 ALD 25 ; [2008] FCA 1638 at [23] to [24]). The Tribunal does not have to repeat its adverse analysis of evidence given in an earlier part of its decision when it states in its "Findings and Reasons" that it has given no weight to that evidence: SZJJA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 111 at [13] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2009] FMCA 171">In relation to the other particulars the applicant submits that the Tribunal failed to give meaningful consideration (or engage in an active intellectual process in considering) the documentary evidence referred to. The applicant relies upon the Federal Court decision in NAJT v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 , in particular at [213] and the decision of his Honour Sackville J in Singh v Minister for Immigration (2001) FCR 152 at [59]. During the course of oral argument, counsel for the applicant also adopted the reasoning of his Honour Finkelstein J in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1638 at [23] - [27] in order to support the proposition that the Tribunal did not properly take into account corroborative evidence in the form of certain documents in dealing with the applicant's claims. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2009] FMCA 102">The issue was recently and cogently dealt with by the Federal Court in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1638 at [23] - [27] where his Honour Finkelstein J said: It is only necessary to deal briefly with the second ground.

<sentence id="cs30" from="[2009] FCA 205">On balance, however, it is considered that the reasons of the Magistrate: (i) disclose the reasoning process in fact adopted; and (ii) display no appellable error. 
Notwithstanding the extent to which the Magistrate has placed reliance upon the material incorporated within his reasons for judgment, the remaining brevity of the language of the Magistrate does indicate that he did give independent consideration to each of the grounds sought to be advanced. The Magistrate correctly concluded that " the applicant failed before the Tribunal because he was not believed ": [2008] FMCA 1644 at [5] . He then went on to address, albeit briefly, the arguments founded upon an alleged breach of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and an allegation of actual bias. The decision in SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1638 , 105 ALD 25 , it was concluded, was to be distinguished. The very process of distinguishing that decision exposes not only an independent consideration of the facts of SZDGC but an independent consideration of the facts of the case then before him and an analysis of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs31" from="[2009] FMCA 110">I prefer the Minister's submissions. I accept that, leaving aside cases where an applicant's credibility has been so comprehensively destroyed that a decision maker need not pay any regard to otherwise corroborative evidence, which is necessarily a restricted class of cases, the Tribunal needs to grapple with corroborative evidence presented before reaching an adverse credibility conclusion [41] . I also accept that in doing so the Tribunal needs to grapple with the relevant issues in an active intellectual process [42] . The Tribunal dealt with Ms Chook's letter at paragraph 81 of its reasons (CB 165): First, the applicant lived in South Korea from July 2004 until December 2007, and did not enquire about or seek refugee protection in that country.</sentence>

I consider this case is distinguishable from SZDGC on the basis that it was not simply a prior adverse finding on credibility that led the Tribunal to give the documents no weight. In addition, the Tribunal decision is supported by the alternative conclusion that the somewhat euphemistically named "caretaker government" of Bangladesh would be unlikely to pursue politically motivated false cases that had previously been made. </sentence>
