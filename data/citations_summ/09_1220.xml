<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 423">The following recent analysis by Finn J in Australian Medic-Care Company Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1220 (" Australian Medicare ") at [632]-[634], provides a useful summary of the relevant principles to be applied in a case like the present; The agreed elements of the action for breach of confidence are, for present purposes, that: 
(i) the information in question must be confidential in character: it must have "the necessary quality of confidence about it": Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v Campbell Engineering Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 203 at 215; 
 
(ii) it must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence: Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd [1969] RPC 41 at 47; Ansell Rubber Co Pty Ltd v Allied Rubber Industries Pty Ltd [1967] VicRp 7 ; [1967] VR 37 at 40; and
 
(iii) there must have been an actual or threatened unauthorised use or disclosure of that information: Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories (Aust) Ltd v Department of Community Services and Health [1989] FCA 384 ; (1990) 22 FCR 73 at 87, 111-112; Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG (a firm) [1998] UKHL 52 ; [1999] 2 AC 222. See generally, Dean, The Law of Trade Secrets and Personal Secrets (2 nd ed, 2002); Toulson and Phipps, Confidentiality (2 nd ed, 2006). The essential attribute of confidential information is what has been described as "relative secrecy": Franchi v Franchi [1967] RPC 149 , at 153; Interfirm Comparison (Australia) Pty Ltd v Law Society of New South Wales [1975] 2 NSWLR 104 at 119. Whether this attribute exists in a given case will be often a question of degree and a variety of criteria have been invoked in varying contexts to sharpen the inquiry to be made: 
(i) is the information in question widely known, or publicly available in the relevant industry, trade, etc: Coco at 51; cf Ansell Rubber Co at 50; Titan Group Pty Ltd v Steriline Manufacturing Pty Ltd (1990) 19 IPR 353 at 381; 
 
(ii) has the confider made the information public by using it in its manufactured products and placing it on the market, or would the ascertainment of the information from the manufactured product by reverse engineering or otherwise require the expenditure of time, effort, money or experimentation: see eg Ackroyds (London) Ltd v Islington Plastics Ltd [1962] RPC 97 ; Aquaculture Corporation v New Zealand Green Mussel Co Ltd (1985) 5 IPR 357 at 379; 
 
(iii) did the confider produce or obtain the information only after the expenditure of time and/or money by way of research or in the application of skill and ingenuity; Saltman Engineering Co Ltd ; cf United Sterling Corporation v Felton [1974] RPC 162 ; Interfirm Comparison (Australia) Ltd , at 117; could another person acquire or duplicate the information only by going through a like process: Cranleigh Precision Engineering Ltd v Bryant [1966] RPC 81 at 89-90; Ansell Rubber Co at 49;
 
(iv) what steps has the confider taken to preserve the secrecy of the information and to prevent it becoming public knowledge: Amber Size &amp; Chemical Co Ltd v Menzel (1913) 30 RPC 433 at 438; Dean, at [3.165]-[3.175]; 
 
(v) is the information intrinsically valuable or is it valuable to the confider or to a competitor or other interested party: Surveys &amp; Mining Ltd v Morrison [1969] Qd R 470 ; Measures Brothers Ltd v Measures [1910] 1 Ch 336 ; and
 
(vi) would a reasonable person in all the circumstances recognise the information to be the "property" of the confider: Deta Nominees Pty Ltd v Viscount Plastic Products Pty Ltd [1979] VicRp 17 ; [1979] VR 167 at 191; Printers &amp; Finishers Ltd v Holloway (No 2) [1965] RPC 239 at 255. There is no single test for determining when the communication of confidential information will import an obligation of confidence. As Gowans J said in Ansell Rubber (at 40): 
 
 
 
 That obligation may come into existence by reason of the terms of an agreement, or what is implicit in them, by reason of the nature of the relationship between persons, or by reason of the subject-matter and the circumstances in which the subject-matter has come into the hands of the person charged with the breach.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 21">38 The notion that no equitable duty of confidence arises where there is a comparable contractual duty is opposed to much authority. Dr Dean says that "Equitable protection ... may be used in preference to an existing contractual obligation or alongside a contractual obligation": Dean, The Law of Trade Secrets and Personal Secrets (2 nd ed, 2002) at [2.55] where many examples in the case law are recorded. They include Morison v Moat [1851] EngR 790 ; (1851) 9 Hare 241 , Robb v Green [1895] 2 QB 315 , Mense v Milenkovic [1973] VicRp 78 ; [1973] VR 784 , Attorney-General v Jonathan Cape Ltd [1976] QB 752 and Nicrotherm Electrical Company Ltd v Percy (1957) 74 RPC 207. See also Australian Medic-Care Co Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1220 ; (2009) 261 ALR 501 at [628] - [629] per Finn J and Gurry, Breach of Confidence (1984) pp 39-46.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWCA 407">I note that in Australian Medic-Care Company Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Limited [2009] FCA 1220 at [119], Finn J expressed the view that the present state of the law in Australia is not yet settled on whether it is possible to use post-contractual conduct as an aid to construction of a written document, though his Honour accepted that the "more favoured view" was that it is not. By reason of what was said in the High Court in Agricultural and Rural Finance v Gardiner , I would respectfully differ from Finn J. In regard to this question, I respectfully agree with Campbell JA that the expressed approach of the majority High Court judgment in Agricultural and Rural v Gardiner evidences a departure from statements in earlier High Court authorities to the contrary, being in particular Farmer v Honan and Dunne [1919] HCA 13 ; 26 CLR 183 at 197 where Isaacs J and Rich J expressly followed Watcham v Attorney-General of the East Africa Protectorate [1919] AC 533 at 540, being the Privy Council decision taken as authority for the use of the later conduct to construe a written agreement; Thornley v Tilley [1925] HCA 13 ; 36 CLR 1 at 11 where Isaacs J expressly referred to utilising later conduct in the process of construction; Sinclair Scott &amp; Company Limited v Naughton [1929] HCA 34 ; 43 CLR 310 at 327 per Isaacs J; E.T. Fisher &amp; Company Pty Limited v The English Scottish and Australian Bank Ltd [1940] HCA 42 ; 64 CLR 84 at 102 where Williams J applied Watcham ; and White v Australian and New Zealand Theatres Limited [1943] HCA 6 ; 67 CLR 266 at 275 and 281 where Starke J and Williams J, respectively, expressly permitted later conduct to construe a document. These cases can be taken to have been departed from by Agricultural and Rural Finance v Gardiner .

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1494">I recently published my reasons in this matter and directed that the parties bring in draft Minutes of Orders: Australian Medic-Care Company Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Limited [2009] FCA 1220. While I gave them the opportunity to put on submissions on costs, I indicated my then present inclination was to make no order as to costs. That view reflected my appreciation of the balance of wins and losses on disputed issues and claims made in the proceedings viewed as a whole. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] NSWSC 1170">If it is not possible to make a finding about the particular words that were used (as sometimes happens when a contract is partly written, partly oral and partly inferred from conduct) the surrounding circumstances can be looked at to find what in substance the parties agreed: County Securities v Challenger Group Holdings at [7]-[8] per Spigelman CJ. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (6) A quite separate type of contractual arrangement to a contract that is partly written and partly oral is where there is a contract wholly in writing and an oral collateral contract: J Evans &amp; Son v Anthony Merzario at WLR 1083C-E; All ER 934h-5a per Roskill LJ, at WLR 1084H; All ER 936c per Geoffrey Lane LJ; Hoyt's v Spencer at 144-5 per Isaacs J; Equuscorp v Glengallan Investments at 484 [36] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ. cf: Australian Medic-Care Company Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Limited [2009] FCA 1220 at [115] et seq per Finn J.
