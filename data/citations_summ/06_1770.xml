<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 3">21 Worimi had also filed two claimant applications in respect of the Land. Both were struck out pursuant to s 84C of the NT Act for failure to comply with s 61: Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 ; Worimi v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 1770. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1929">9 I have recorded the history of this matter in Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2007] FCA 1357 (' Worimi 2007 '). That history includes the striking out of two claimant applications filed by the third respondent, Mr Gary Dates, who prefers to be called Worimi. I will refer to him as Worimi. Each application was struck out pursuant to s 84C of the Act for failure to comply with s 61 ( Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 ; Worimi v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 1770 (' Worimi 2006 ')). Worimi did not give notice within the notification period that he wanted to be a party to the non-claimant application. On 30 March 2007, Worimi filed an amended notice of motion to be joined as a party to the non-claimant application pursuant to s 84(5) of the Act. For the reasons set out in Worimi 2007 , I made an order that he be joined as a respondent to these proceedings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1357">1 The Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council ('the Land Council'), previously represented by an administrator, Mr Hillig, seeks a declaration that no native title exists over land at Port Stephens, being Lot 576 in Deposited Plan 48823 ('the Land'). By notice of motion filed on 23 August 2005, Mr Gary Dates, also known as Worimi, sought to become a party to the proceedings. Worimi has previously filed two claimant applications for a determination that native title exists over the Land. I struck out each application pursuant to s 84C of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act') for failure to comply with s 61 of the Act ( Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 ; Worimi v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 1770). Worimi had previously indicated that he intended to file a further claimant application. That has not occurred and there is no present suggestion of any intention on Worimi's part to do so. By an amended notice of motion filed on 30 March 2007, Worimi seeks to be joined as a respondent to this non-claimant application under s 84(5) of the Act. The application for joinder is opposed by the Land Council. </sentence>

1 I refer to my decision in Worimi v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 1770 in which I dealt with an application to strike out a native title claimant application ('the claimant proceedings').</sentence>
