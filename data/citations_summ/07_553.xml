<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] AATA 679">In Lo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 553 ; (2007) 159 FCR 160 (" Lo "), Ms Lo had her Business Skills visa cancelled. The NOIC was sent to Ms Lo and not to her authorised recipient. The Court held that the relevant authorisation had not been operative at the time of sending the NOIC and dismissed her application. However, the Court also considered whether Ms Lo would have been validly notified given that she had actually received the NOIC within the time limit. The Court considered the Minister's submissions in relation to the notification issue, as stated above, and did not express disagreement with them, though ultimately the Court held that in this case there had been no authorised recipient at the time the NOIC was sent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 1205">However in Lo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 553 at [44] , Conti J accepted the submission of the Minister that a breach of s.494D(1) (which is in terms equivalent to s.441G of the Act ) does not constitute jurisdictional error in circumstances where the principal receives actual notice. 
 Since preparing these reasons, I have also considered the reasons for judgment of Conti J in Lo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 553 ('Lo').</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCAFC 62">42 Since preparing these reasons, I have also considered the reasons for judgment of Conti J in Lo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 553 (" Lo "). That decision concerned the appointment of an authorised recipient under s 494D of the Act and may be distinguished on the ground that Conti J found that at the relevant time there was no appointment of an authorised recipient in existence. To the extent that his Honour may have decided the case on a broader basis which is inconsistent with the reasoning set out above, I would, with respect, decline to follow the decision in Lo .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCAFC 63">56 After the hearing of this appeal the legal representatives of the first respondent drew our attention to a judgment of Conti J delivered on 18 April 2007 in Lo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 553 (" Lo "). Although in that judgment his Honour mentions both Le and Makhu those references (which arose from submissions by the parties) do not change the view which I take. The decision in Lo turned upon factual findings to the effect that at the relevant time the applicant in that case did not have an authorised recipient to whom correspondence to her must be sent. 1 I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Besanko J in a draft form. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes for the reasons he gives. I remain of that opinion notwithstanding the recent judgment of the Court in Lo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 553. I certify that the preceding one (1) numbered paragraph is a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore. Associate:

Dated: 11 May 2007

 
 


  As I have said, I have reached the conclusion that under ss 359A, 379A and 379G the authorised recipient must be given a document by one of the methods specified in s 379A. That follows in my view from the express terms of s 359A(2)(a) of which there was no equivalent in Le. 
 
 Since preparing these reasons, I have also considered the reasons for judgment of Conti J in Lo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 553 (' Lo '). That decision concerned the appointment of an authorised recipient under s 494D of the Act and may be distinguished on the ground that Conti J found that at the relevant time there was no appointment of an authorised recipient in existence. To the extent that his Honour may have decided the case on a broader basis which is inconsistent with the reasoning set out above, I would, with respect, decline to follow the decision in Lo .</sentence>
