<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 106">7 The second appeal concerned a challenge to a recommendation made on 20 August 2008 by the Chief Executive Officer of Customs to the Minister to take steps to secure the continuation of anti-dumping measures in respect of exports from Thailand. This recommendation was contained within Trade Measures Report No. 137 . A challenge was also made to the decision of the Minister on 27 August 2008 to accept that recommendation. The primary Judge also upheld those challenges and set aside the recommendations and the Minister's declaration: Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd v Minister of State for Home Affairs (No 2) [2009] FCA 838. This proceeding became known as " the continuation proceeding ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 86">110 Building upon that conclusion, the primary Judge further concluded that the reliance upon Report 134 in Report 137 was the taking into account of an irrelevant consideration. The conclusion of the primary Judge was expressed as follows in [2009] FCA 838: 
 [64] However, Report 137 also relied on the analysis in Report 134 to arrive at non-injurious prices for Siam's exports to Australia. Relying on that analysis, Report 137 found that imports of the product from Thailand, if dumped, "have the potential to cause injury to Qenos". I have found in the review judgment that Report 134 provided an insufficient basis in law for the Minister to arrive at a conclusion that the measures should have remained in place. It follows that in making his determination under s 269ZHG(1) , the Minister had regard to an irrelevant consideration (namely the findings in Report 134 and the notice made under s 269ZDB((1)(a)) in arriving at the conclusion that the measures should be continued under s 269ZHG(1). His Honour went on to conclude that " Report 137 did not provide any reasoning process as to why the removal of measures against Siam would be likely to cause material injury to Qenos ": at paragraph [65].  90 His Honour relevantly concluded that the term " likely " in s 269ZHF(2) meant " more probably than not " and that the " character of the threat " for the purposes of s 269TG(2) is " governed " by s 269TAE(2B): [2009] FCA 838 at [48] and [49].  93 The learned primary Judge relevantly concluded that " Report 137 did not make a finding that it was likely (i.e. more probable than not) that dumping by Siam would cause material injury to Qenos if the measures expired ": [2009] FCA 838 at [53] .  26 Siam again sought judicial review of both the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer and the declaration of the Minister. In the continuation proceeding, the primary Judge set aside the recommendations made by the Chief Executive Officer and the declaration made by the Minister in so far as they related to Siam: Siam Polyethylene Co Limited v Minister of State for Home Affairs (No 2) [2009] FCA 838 ; 258 ALR 515. The primary Judge concluded that the Chief Executive Officer and the Minister had failed to apply the correct test and had failed to ask the correct question for the purposes of ss 269ZHF(1) and 269ZHG (1). His Honour considered that the likelihood of dumped product from Thailand causing material injury to Qenos had to be addressed. 134 A different conclusion, however, has been reached with respect to His Honour's second decision in Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd v Minister of State for Home Affairs (No 2) [2009] FCA 838 , 258 ALR 515.  125 Even if it be presently assumed, however, that s 269TAE(2B) " operate[s] on a sunset review under Div 6A of Pt XVB " ([2009] FCA 838 at [55]), it is not considered that Report 137 failed to address the matters referred to in s 269TAE(2A) or (2B).  88 In reaching his conclusion that the recommendations made on 20 August 2008 and the declaration made on 27 August 2008 should be set aside in so far as they apply to Siam, the primary Judge set forth both the manner in which he construed and applied s 269ZHF(2) and his analysis of Report 137 : [2009] FCA 838. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 837">In Oil Country Tubular Goods (AB-2004-4) at [177], [276]-[285] the WTO Appellate Body analysed the differing processes applicable in the initial decision to impose measures and the issues involved, at that stage, in determining whether there was an injury (including a threatened injury) under Art 3 and the subsequent decision in a "sunset review" to continue measures at the end of the initial five year period contemplated in Art 11.3 and in ss 269TM(1) and Div 6A of Pt XVB (Siam's related case involves a "sunset review" Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd v Minister of State for Home Affairs (No 2) [2009] FCA 838). The WTO Appellate Body concluded that in a sunset review Art 11.3 did not require that injury and likelihood of injury be determined again in accordance with Art 3. It found that for the purpose of determining that there was a likelihood of injury on a review, a decision-maker did not have to undertake all of the analyses required by Art 3 in order for the decision-maker to have a "sufficient factual basis" to arrive at a "reasoned conclusion" permitting a decision to continue measures at the end of the five year period: Oil Country Tubular Goods (AB-2004-4) at [280]-[283].</sentence>
