<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 240">In separate proceedings in this Court, Esso and BHP have sued the shipowner for damages in respect of the cost of repair of the pipeline and other alleged losses estimated to exceed $27 million. The cost of repair of the pipeline alone is said to amount to nearly the whole of the value of the ship. Two other plaintiffs, Huntsman Chemical Corporation Pty Ltd and Qenos Pty Ltd, both large consumers of ethane gas supplied from the Altona end of the pipeline, have each begun other proceedings in this Court against the shipowner claiming damages for pure economic loss estimated at $12 million and $27.6 million respectively. A trial of a separate question in the latter proceedings was ordered to determine whether the gas customers' claims were capable of being made subject to a limitation of liability under Art 2 of the Convention. Finkelstein J has found that they are: Qenos Pty Ltd v Ship "APL Sydney" [2009] FCA 1090 ; (2009) 260 ALR 692. And the Port of Melbourne Corporation has sued for damages, or indemnity or contribution but has not yet given an estimate of its claim. </sentence>
