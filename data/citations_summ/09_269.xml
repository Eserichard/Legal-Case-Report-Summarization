<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 488">The concept of the "public interest" has been said to be both nebulous and amorphous (see Tomasic, "Commercial Morality and Public Policy as Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law" in Cranston (ed) Making Commercial Law: Essays in Honour of Roy Goode (1997) p 463). In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Storm Financial Ltd [2009] FCA 269 , Logan J stated (at [64]) that: 
 
...of course the interest of the public is not synonymous with the public interest. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 498">As noted, under s 461(1)(k) of the Act, the Court may order the winding up of a company if the Court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable that the company be wound up. The categories of circumstances that satisfy the just and equitable ground are not closed or rigid: Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Storm Financial Ltd [2009] FCA 269 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 81 at [65] and Re Westbourne Galleries Ltd [1973] AC 360 .  In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Storm Financial Ltd [2009] FCA 269 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 81 at 109 [67] , Logan J observed: 
 
 
 That Parliament intended that ASIC would act as a scrutineer of the public interest in a case like the present is evident from s.1(2)(a) and (b) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001(Cth), which materially provide that it is to strive to: 
 
 

 
 
 
 (a) maintain, facilitate and improve the performance of the financial system and the entities within that system in the interests of commercial certainty ...; and 
 
 

 
 
 
 (b) promote the confident and informed participation of investors and consumers in the financial system.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 295">They seek ancillary orders in respect of the notification of creditors of companies within the RiverCity Motorway Group and the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission. In addition, they seek an order which would confer upon all other interested parties liberty to apply on not less than three business days notice. In Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Storm Financial Ltd [2009] FCA 269 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 81 at [1] to [3], I made the following observations in respect of Pt 5.3A of ch 5 of the Corporations Act : 
 
 Part 5.3A of ch 5 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) makes provision for inter alia, the administration of a company's affairs with a view to the execution of a deed of company arrangement after its approval at a meeting of creditors. Its origins may be traced to amendments made to the Act's predecessor, the Corporations Law (repealed), by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 (Cth) (Corporate Law Reform Act). 
 
 In the Explanatory Memorandum circulated by the then Attorney-General when introducing the bill which became the Corporate Law Reform Act , it was noted (paras 14, 15 and 21) that the proposed Pt 5.3A would implement recommendations made in the Law Reform Commission's Report No 45 in respect of the Commission's General Insolvency Inquiry, popularly known as "the Harmer Report".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FCA 63">This is the first directions hearing in respect of an application which the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (the Commission) makes under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) against Mr and Mrs Cassimatis for the imposition of pecuniary penalties. In 2009, it fell to me to hear and determine an application which the Commission made for the winding up of Storm Financial Ltd: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Storm Financial Ltd (recs and mgrs apptd) (admin apptd) and Others (ACN 064 804 691) [2009] FCA 269 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 81. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 502">But considerations beyond mere quantum may be relevant to take into account in determining what is in the interests of the creditors and whether it is established that an adjournment may be said to be in the creditors' interests. Where there are advantages in either course, in general terms it may well be the proper course to give such adjournment as will allow the creditors themselves to vote upon the proposal and determine which course they prefer. In a judgment which I recently delivered in Australian Securities and Investments Commission, in the matter of Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) v Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) [2009] FCA 269 , I observed of such a survey of authority that the long and the short of it was that s 440A(2) means what it says. It is for the person seeking the adjournment to satisfy the court that in the circumstances of the particular case, it is in the interests of the company's creditors for it to continue under administration rather than be wound up. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1399">In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) [2009] FCA 269 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 81 at [20] - [27] , I canvassed authorities touching upon the question of the judicial satisfaction to which s 440A(2) of the Corporations Act refers. I shall not repeat afresh what is there stated. The subsection requires that there be some persuasive case that it is in the interests of creditors for a company to continue under administration. On analysis, for reasons given above, the material now to hand reveals no such case. Rather, it reveals a situation where creditors may come to vote at the meeting on the false premise that there is a substantial benefit being conferred in relation to the deed by Mr James Tonge's offer of subordination and more generally on the basis of an absence of consideration of the ramifications of the company's having acted as the trustee of the Barr Trust. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 476">In a judgment which I recently delivered in Australian Securities and Investments Commission, in the matter of Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) v Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) [2009] FCA 269 , I observed of such a survey of authority that the long and the short of it was that s 440A(2) means what it says. It is for the person seeking the adjournment to satisfy the court that in the circumstances of the particular case, it is in the interests of the company's creditors for it to continue under administration rather than be wound up. I approach the question of whether to adjourn having regard to the authorities just mentioned and what I have described as the long and the short of it. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 410">In the matter of Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed); Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) [2009] FCA 269 at [65] , I canvassed both learned academic authority as well as judicial decisions relating to the history and nature of the jurisdiction to wind up a company on the just and equitable ground. I shall not repeat what I there stated. It suffices to note that the just and equitable ground is one which provides for a very broad basis indeed upon which a company may be wound up. Further, it is neither necessary nor desirable to seek to place limits on language which Parliament has made deliberately broad in its purview.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 298">I delivered judgement on 26 March 2009 in respect of the substantive application made by ASIC: Australian Securities and Investments Commission; in the matter of Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) v Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) [2009] FCA 269. Both in the course of submissions and after delivering judgement on 26 March 2009, I raised with the parties the question of what further material, if any, beyond that referred to in O 46 r 6(2) of the Federal Court Rules , ought to be the subject of a grant of leave to a non-party to inspect on the Court's file. </sentence>
