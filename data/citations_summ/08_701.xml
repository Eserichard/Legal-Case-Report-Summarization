<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 276">That construction is consistent with a number of authorities. In Bhagat 
 v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] NSWCA 160 , Spigelman CJ (with whom the other members of the court agreed) observed at [29], that a demand for surrender may constitute an attempt to negotiate a settlement. In Korean Airlines Co Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) [2008] FCA 701 , Jacobson J at [73], relying upon the effect of the authorities at common law, emphasised that it is not necessary that an offer to negotiate include an offer capable of acceptance. In South Shropshire District Council v Amos [1987] 1 All ER 340 , the English Court of Appeal held that the common law privilege was not limited to documents which are offers. Nor is it necessary for there to be a specific proposal for compromise for the protection of the without prejudice rule to be attracted. As Hasluck J said in Chandler v Water Corporation [2004] WASC 95 at [56] : 
 
 It is true that the Veersma letter does not contain a specific proposal for compromise. However, the letter contains assertions bearing upon the strength of the plaintiffs' case and is clearly directed to the plaintiffs' wish to settle along the lines adopted in settlement discussions with other plaintiffs. This gives a degree of specificity to the letter which is sufficient to attract the protection of the without prejudice rule.

 Communications made "in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement" 
 
 The statutory requirement that the communication be "in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement" reflects the language used by the High Court in Field : at 293. There, Dixon CJ, Webb, Kitto and Taylor JJ contemplated that the privilege extends to cover communications that are reasonably incidental to negotiations. The effect of the authorities at common law is that the privilege applies to offers to negotiate and expressions of willingness to do so; it is not necessary that there be an offer capable of acceptance: Arnotts at 72---3. The same position applies under the Evidence Act . It is sufficient that the communication can be described as an "opening shot" in negotiations: GPI Leisure Corporation Ltd v Yuill (1997) 42 NSWLR 225 at 226.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] NSWDC 213">17 Although cases such as Moran v Moran (No.3) [2000] NSWSC 151 and Mulkearns v Chandos Developments Pty Ltd (No.4) [2005] NSWSC 511 have arguably taken a broader view of s 131(2)(g) than Brown those cases are very different to the present case. In both Moran and Mulkearns the privileged communication tendered was directly relevant to an issue in the proceedings. In Moran without the privileged communication the jury may have been misled as to the state of mind of a person in the days before his death. This was an issue which had been given some prominence in the case. I note that Jacobsen J in Korean Air Lines v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) [2008] FCA 701 at [83] considered that the document in Moran was admitted in accordance with s. 131(2)(g) because the jury would have been misled without it. In Mulkearns the fact that the defendant had made an offer of settlement was relevant for without it the Court could have been misled into thinking that the defendant was a greedy defendant not prepared to give an inch. This fact was relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 312">There was no direct evidence from Mr Samuel that he had regard to the burden imposed on the applicants when deciding to issue the Notices. In proceedings of this nature I would not expect Mr Samuel to provide direct evidence: see eg Korean Air Lines v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) [2008] FCA 701 at [116] per Jacobsen J. The only available evidence suggesting that Mr Samuel might have taken into account the effect of issuing the Notices on the applicants is derived from the Reason to Believe papers, and the objective matters available to Mr Samuel at the time of the issuing of the Notices, including the Notices themselves. </sentence>
