<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 415">The application was unusual as it was made 15 years after the transaction for the reasons set out at [5] to [10] of the reasons published in Carringbush Corporation Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (" Carringbush v ASIC ") [2008] FCA 474 ; (2008) 72 ATR 17 , which I will not repeat in these reasons. The securities regulator (ASIC) and the liquidators of Rothwells did not contest the application although served with the papers and given notice of the hearing. The Commissioner did not appear although served with the papers and also given notice of the hearing. As there was no prejudice to Rothwells or its former liquidators arising out of the disposition of the shares which were fully paid and the transaction did not have the effect of avoiding any liability on the part of CPL as the entity recorded in the share register of Rothwells and no prejudice arose to the shareholders, the Court ordered that the transfer of the Rothwells shares by CPL to CCPL on 26 May 1993 was not rendered void by operation of s 468(1) of the Act.  The solicitor for the applicants, Mr Damien Bourke, swore an affidavit on 2 February 2010 in which he deposes to these things: I have calculated the quantum of the costs which had been incurred (solicitor/client) by the Applicants as at 25 November 2008. The Applicants at this time had filed a significant body of evidence including affidavits from each of the Applicants Mr/s Clark (filed 29 August 2008 and 15 September 2008 respectively); an Affidavit of Mr Denoon (filed 29 August 2008); a further Affidavit of Mr Scott (filed 15 September 2008); an Affidavit of Mr Anthony Lovett (filed 1 September 2008) and an affidavit of Mr Roxborough (filed 26 September 2008). The Respondent was fully informed by 25 November 2008 of the nature of the case it was to meet --- a fortiori since it had the benefit of the sworn evidence of Mr Denoon as well as the Judgment which was given in the Carringbush proceedings [Carringbush Corporation v ASIC (2008) FCA 474]. The investigations which were carried out with witnesses as well as the history of the matter (including the Respondent's shifting of position), resulted in costs totalling $307 510 (solicitor/client --- including Counsel). I am a solicitor having been admitted to practice in 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1401">No question arises under s 468(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth): Carringbush Corporation Pty Ltd v ASIC [2008] FCA 474 ; (2008) 26 ACLC 506. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWSC 618">28 In Carringbush Corporation Pty Ltd v ASIC [2008] FCA 474 , Greenwood J granted approval under the unamended s 468(1) to a transfer of shares of a company in liquidation that had been made 15 years earlier. His Honour carefully considered the case law as to the nature and scope for power, but evidently did not think it necessary to address expressly the retrospective aspect of the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] VSC 426">14 The short answer to the propositions in Mr Landeryou's defence and written submissions is that the construction of s 468 contended for by him is wrong. Whilst any transfer of shares made after the commencement of a winding up is void unless appropriately sanctioned so far as regards any effect to be given to it by the company, a contract to transfer shares is not rendered void by the section as between the parties themselves. [20] This is because the purpose of s 468(1) in relation to the transfer of shares [21] is to prevent a shareholder from evading liability as a contributory by transferring shares to some impecunious person after a winding up has commenced [22] and this purpose is sufficiently served by avoiding the transfer only so far as the company is concerned. It follows that the defences raised by Mr Landeryou in his pleadings are no answer to Jordanlane's claim against him. In any event, I note for the sake of completeness that there is no evidence that Jordanlane knew or ought to have known that the Deed of Settlement was not valid and there is no evidence that Mr Landeryou had any belief (mistaken or otherwise) as to the force and effect of it.</sentence>
