<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 318">On 4 September 2009 Mr Kowalski filed a notice of appeal from the decision of Besanko J in Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited [2009] FCA 991: see [95] above. The notice of appeal stated that if the decision of Besanko J was interlocutory then leave to appeal was sought. There followed a number of interlocutory applications in the appeal proceeding.  Ms Bochner also provided "a chronological summary of the corresponding Federal Court decisions in relation to proceedings instituted by the Respondent". She lists 33 decisions in respect of which written reasons were given. I have added another decision (number 34) that was relied upon by the applicants and discussed in their submissions although not listed in Ms Bochner's affidavit. The citations for those decisions and other relevant details are as follows: Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd (1998) FCR 55 , SG 100 of 1997, 16 October 1998; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1153 , SAD 190 of 2001, 17 September 2002; Kowalski v Trustee of Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 14 , SAD 234 of 2002, 15 January 2003; Kowalski v Trustee, Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 18 , SAD 234 of 2002, 28 February 2003; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1069 , (2000) 242 ALR 370 SAD 11 of 2007, 24 July 2007; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 691 , SAD 11 of 2007, 20 May 2008; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2008] FCA 1873 , SAD 171 of 2008, 4 December 2008; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1970 , SAD 168 of 2008, 22 December 2008; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 47 , SAD 216 of 2008, 30 January 2009; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 48 , SAD 205 of 2008, 3 February 2009; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 153 , SAD 3 of 2009, 27 February 2009; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 , SAD 168 of 2008, 30 July 2009; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCAFC 107, (2009) 259 ALR 444 ; SAD 26 of 2009, 14 August 2009; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 , SAD 171 of 2008, 3 September 2009; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 117 , (2009) 259 ALR 319 ; SAD 20 of 2009, 9 September 2009; Kowalski v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2009] FCA 1044 , SAD 75 of 2009, 17 September 2009; Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia [2009] FCA 1072 , SAD 81 of 2009, 23 September 2009; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 1289 , SAD 133 of 2009, 9 November 2009; Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia [2009] FCA 1420 , SAD 165 of 2009, 2 December 2009;  Justice Besanko rejected all of Mr Kowalski's claims as being without substance and doomed to fail: Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited [2009] FCA 991. His Honour stated at [43]: 
 
 Not only is the proceeding doomed to fail as presently pleaded, but I am satisfied that there is no claim of the type advanced. The applicant has already amended once and he has put forward a number of affidavits and written submissions in respect of his "claims", all of which I have read carefully. In an interlocutory application Mr Kowalski applied to Besanko J for his Honour to disqualify himself from involvement in the application for judicial review. Besanko J rejected any suggestion of actual bias but agreed to disqualify himself because of his involvement in other proceedings: Kowalski v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2009] FCA 1044. His Honour said that the question was whether by reason of either or both of his decisions in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 (see [85] above) and Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 (see [95] above) he should disqualify himself from further participation in the proceeding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 270">One application sought to invoke the Trade Practices Act 1975 (Cth) (the TP Act) in a non-specific way, making allegations of fraud, breach of trust, misrepresentation and non-compliance with statutory requirements in relation to the Heads of Agreement. The other was an appeal from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal about its finding concerning the asserted responsibility of the respondent to the Health Insurance Commission or Medicare under the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (Cth) (the HOSC Act), because the Heads of Agreement included resolution of his compensation claims or some of them, and also invoking in a non-specific way the TP Act apparently to enliven the jurisdiction of the FCA. Those proceedings were each summarily dismissed: Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 and Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia [2010] FCA 413. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1171">The applicant then returned to the FCA. One application sought to invoke the Trade Practices Act 1975 (Cth) (the TP Act) in a non-specific way, making allegations of fraud, breach of trust, misrepresentation and non-compliance with statutory requirements in relation to the Heads of Agreement. The other was an appeal from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal about its finding concerning the asserted responsibility of the respondent to the Health Insurance Commission or Medicare under the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (Cth) (the HOSC Act), because the Heads of Agreement included resolution of his compensation claims or some of them, and also invoking in a non-specific way the TP Act apparently to enliven the jurisdiction of the FCA. Those proceedings were each summarily dismissed: Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 and Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia [2010] FCA 413. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCAFC 73"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1466">I delivered my decision in Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors on 3 September 2009: Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited [2009] FCA 991. In my reasons, I dealt with a further application made by Mr Kowalski that I disqualify myself in that proceeding. I again refused to disqualify myself. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1289">On 3 September 2009, Besanko J delivered a judgment in proceedings between Mr Kowalski and Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited (Mitsubishi) in which his Honour ordered that certain Notices of Motion be dismissed, that the Amended Statement of Claim filed in that proceeding be struck out and that the proceeding itself be dismissed: Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991. The following day, Mr Kowalski applied by a document entitled "Notice of Appeal" to appeal from that decision. That application is this proceeding. It is listed for hearing before the Full Court in the February session of the Full Court. The "Notice of Appeal" set out the orders sought, including in paragraph 3.1 of the "Notice of Appeal", an order for leave to appeal if the decision he sought to appeal from was an interlocutory decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 1072">The applicant's letter of 17 March 2009, in reply, refers to part of a judgment in proceedings in the Supreme Court of South Australia, and separate proceedings apparently instituted by the applicant against Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd (MMAL) in this Court (in respect of which judgment was delivered on 3 September 2009: see Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 , from which an appeal has been instituted and is shortly to be heard). The letter then proceeds to assert that MMAL had failed to comply with s 23 of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (Cth) (the HOSC Act). It seeks a reply to those assertions. The subsequent letter of 25 March 2009, apart from referring to that letter, is in the following terms: 
 
 As outlined in my letter dated 11 March 2009, Medicare Australia is entitled to accept the Heads of Agreement as a declaration of the agreed terms of settlement between yourself and Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited, until it is otherwise legally determined. 
 

 
 
 At this stage, I am unable to provide you with any further information in relation to this matter. 
 

 
 
 I remind you that your completed history statement and statutory declaration are now due to be returned to Medicare Australia. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 1044">After I had delivered judgment in the appeal in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 , but before I had delivered judgment in Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited (SAD 171 of 2008), the applicant again asked me to disqualify myself. I again declined to do so and I proceeded to deliver judgment in the matter of Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 at [7]- [12].  It seems to me that the question on this application is whether, by reason of my decision in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 991 or my decision in Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited [2009] FCA 991 , or both, I should disqualify myself from hearing this proceeding.  As a judge of this Court, I have sat on two cases involving the applicant. They were Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 (SAD 168 of 2008) and Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 (SAD 171 of 2008).  I am disposed to think that my decision in Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 does not provide a reason for me to disqualify myself from further involvement in the present proceeding, but in the circumstances, I do not need to express a concluded view. I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Ruling herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko. Associate:
 
 
Dated: 17 September 2009
 
 The Applicant appeared in person. Counsel for the Respondent: Ms R J Evans 
 
 Solicitor for the Respondent: Sparke Helmore 
 Date of Hearing: 8 September 2009 
 
 Date of Judgment: 17 September 2009
