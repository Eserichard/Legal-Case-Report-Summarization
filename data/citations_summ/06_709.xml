<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 309">12 I have no doubt that the applicant sought to have regard to matters of this kind when it put forward the figure of $8,250. It should also be borne in mind that the financial inability of an unsuccessful party to meet costs is generally not a sufficient reason to deprive a successful part of a costs award: see Selliah v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [1998] FCA 469 and MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 709. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 893">
 
11 The first respondent sought the costs of this appeal. The appellant submitted that he was not working and would be unable to pay such costs. The authorities establish that this is not a sufficient reason to depart from the ordinary rule: MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 709. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal, with costs. I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny. Associate:

 Counsel for the Respondent: S Moore 
 
 Solicitor for the Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor 
 
 Date of Hearing: 11 July 2006
