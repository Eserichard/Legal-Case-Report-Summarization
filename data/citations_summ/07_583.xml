<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1480">84 Conduct is " likely to mislead or deceive " if there is a " real or not remote chance or possibility regardless of whether it is less or more than fifty per cent ": Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 87 per Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ (applying Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union [1979] FCA 85 ; (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 346 per Deane J; Sheen v Fields Pty Ltd (1984) 58 ALJR 93) ; Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 7) [2008] FCA 1364 at [97] . A corporation's state of mind is immaterial in making out a case of misleading or deceptive conduct. In Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88 the Full Court relevantly observed:
 If a corporation is alleged to have contravened s 52(1) by making a statement of past or present fact, the corporation's state of mind is immaterial unless the statement involved the state of the corporation's mind. Whether or not s 52(1) is contravened does not depend upon the corporation's intention or its belief concerning the accuracy of such statement, but upon whether the statement in fact contains or conveys a meaning which is false; that is to say whether the statement contains or conveys a misrepresentation. Most commonly, such a statement will contain or convey a false meaning if what is stated concerning the past or present fact is not accurate; but a statement which is literally true may contain or convey a meaning which is false. See also: Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Hadgkiss [2007] FCAFC 197 at [79] ---[83] [2007] FCAFC 197 ; , 248 ALR 169 at 182---3 per Buchanan J. The liability created by s 52 , it must also be recalled, was not " designed for the benefit of persons who fail, in the circumstances of the case, to take reasonable care of their own interests ": Elders Trustee and Executor Co Ltd v E G Reeves Pty Ltd [1987] FCA 332 ; (1987) 78 ALR 193 at 241 per Gummow J. See also: Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1981) 149 CLR 191 at 199 per Gibbs CJ ; Rawley Pty Ltd v Bell (No 2) [2007] FCA 583 at [212] , 61 ACSR 648 at 701 per Finn J; Webster v Havyn Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 227 at [73] per Palmer J. 109 Section 75B provides in relevant part as follows: 
 75B Interpretation (1) A reference in this Part to a person involved in a contravention of a provision of Part IV, IVA, IVB, V or VC, or of section 75AU, 75AYA or 95AZN, shall be read as a reference to a person who: (a) has aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contravention; ... (c) has been in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention; ... Section 75B does not require that a person knew he was participating in a contravention of the Act; what is required is actual knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention and intentional participation in it: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 666---70 per Mason ACJ, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ; Rawley Pty Ltd v Bell (No 2) [2007] FCA 583 at [40] per Finn J; Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 at [267] ---[280]. There may be some circumstances where knowledge may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances: cf Pereira v Director of Public Prosecutions [1988] HCA 57 at [11] , 82 ALR 217 at 219---20.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1429">1 When I handed down my decision in Rawley Pty Ltd v Bell (No 2) [2007] FCA 583 , such was my dissatisfaction with the course and conduct of this matter that I indicated a provisional inclination not to make orders as to costs in either of the applications that I had there dismissed. Nonetheless, I invited the parties to put on submissions as to costs. They did so voluminously, save for Mr Bell who indicated he would abide by the orders of the Court. Having considered the parties submissions and having reviewed the costs issues in light of what are well accepted principles that properly inform the exercise of my discretion under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), I am satisfied that to deny the successful respondents any costs at all would, in the circumstances, be punitive. It is not a proper use of the power to award costs to punish either a successful or an unsuccessful party: cf Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 566-567.
