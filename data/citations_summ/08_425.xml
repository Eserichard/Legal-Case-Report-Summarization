<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 234">Maranoa also takes no issue with his Honour's general approach to the determination of penalty and his application of the totality principle. In that regard, see QR Limited v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia [2010] FCAFC 150 at (62), where Keane CJ and Marshall J said: 
 
 Once the appropriate level for each of the contraventions has been assessed, it is necessary to consider the aggregate of those to form a view as to whether that aggregate is so out of proportion to the overall misconduct of the appellants as to constitute an unjust result: see Australian Opthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 at [23] ; McIver v Healey [2008] FCA 425 at [30] - [31].

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 956">The first step for the Court is to identify the separate contraventions involved. Each breach of each separate obligation found in the AFPCS, the NAPSA is a separate contravention of a term of an applicable provision for the purposes of s.719. [11] 23. However, s.719(2) provides for treating multiple breaches, involved in a course of conduct, as a single breach. 24.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 905">3.13 The maximum penalty that may be imposed by the Court for each breach of the WR Regs is: $5,500 for each contravention by the First Respondent (as a body corporate); and $1,100 for each contravention by the Third Respondent (as an individual). Approach to determining penalty 
 The applicant submitted, and the respondents accepted, that the proper approach to determining penalty in cases such as this is as follows: 4.2 The first step for the Court is to identify the separate contraventions involved. Each breach of each separate obligation found in the Award and the AFPCS in relation to the employee is a separate contravention of a term of an applicable provision for the purposes of section 719 of the WR Act [4] ; as is each breach of each applicable regulation for the purposes of regulation 14.4 of the WR Regs. However, section 719(2) of the WR Act and regulation 14.5 of the WR Regs provide for treating multiple breaches, involved in a course of conduct, as a single breach. 4.3 Secondly, the Court will then consider an appropriate penalty to impose in respect of each contravention (whether a single contravention or a course of conduct), having regard to all of the circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 621">The first step is to identify each of the separate contraventions involved. Each breach of each separate obligation found in the Workplace Relations Act in relation to the employees is a separate contravention of a term of an applicable provision for the purposes of s.719 [17] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 599">The first step for the Court is to identify the separate contraventions involved. Each breach of each separate obligation found in the AFPCS, the NAPSA is a separate contravention of a term of an applicable provision for the purposes of s.719. [2] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FMCA 718">In those circumstances, it is incumbent on this Court to take into account the following principles in determining the question of penalty. Each separate contravention of the respective AWAs in respect of each employee has been identified. In the decision above, each separate contravention of the relevant AWA has been identified for the purposes of s.719: Gibbs v Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of City of Altona [1992] FCA 374 ; (1992) 37 FCR 216 at [223] ; McIver v Healy [2008] FCA 425 per Marshall J at [16]. The Court notes that s.719(2) provides for treating multiple breaches involved in the course of conduct as a single breach. Where two or more contraventions have common elements, this should be taken into account in considering what is an appropriate penalty in all the circumstances for each contravention and the Respondent should be penalised more than once for the same conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] VMC 26"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] FMCA 252">The respondents seek then to rely on the decision in McIver v Healey [2008] FCA 425 apparently to submit that nominal penalties should be imposed for some breaches and substantial penalties in respect of others. In the circumstances of this case with 148 breaches, the Court finds it appropriate to apply the same averaged penalty for each breach and then decide whether the penalties in total are appropriate to the conduct. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 1255">Insofar as the respondents submitted that breaches of separate provisions arose out of the one course of conduct within the meaning of s.719(2) of the Act or reg.2.14.5, I reject this submission. Both s.719(2) and reg.2.14.5 operate in relation to two or more breaches of the same " term " or " provision " of the Act, Regulations or NAPSA and not to breaches of a number of different provisions of the Act, Regulations or NAPSA (see McIver v Healey [2008] FCA 425). In Gibbs Gray J held that each separate obligation (in that case in an award) should be regarded as a term for the purposes of the predecessor to s.719, although, as his Honour also stated (at 223): The ascertainment of what is a term should depend not on matters of form, such as how the award maker has chosen to designate by numbers or letters the various provisions of an award, but on matters of substance, namely the different obligations which can be spelt out. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] VMC 14"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] VMC 10"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FMCA 208">The applicant submitted that: "6.18. There is a lack of evidence from TKM and Ms Loone explaining the underpayments. McIver v Healey [2008] FCA 425 at [34] .McIver v 6.19. Any submission made by the respondent in mitigation of penalty which is not supported by evidence should not be given any weight. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FMCA 38">The applicant does not accept that s.719(2) has any application to group the contraventions by the respondents concerning Ms Iglesias and Mr Elbehidi. It was submitted that the employees were engaged at quite different periods of time, such that the contraventions, whilst similar, did not arise out of the same course of conduct. I agree (see McIver v Healey [2008] FCA 425). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FMCA 1028">In Gibbs v The Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of the City of Altona (1992) 37 FCR 216 Gray J stated at 223: The object of s 178(2) appears to be that a party bound by an award and pursuing a course of conduct involving repeated acts or omissions, which would ordinarily be regarded as giving rise to a series of separate breaches, should not be punished separately for each of those breaches. If such a party has pursued a course of conduct which gives rise to breaches of several different obligations, there is no reason why it should be treated as immune in respect of its breach of one obligation, merely because it has acted in breach of another. This reasoning leads to the conclusion that each separate obligation found in an award is to be regarded as a "term", for the purposes of s 178 of the Act. The ascertainment of what is a term should depend not on matters of form, such as how the award maker has chosen to designate by numbers or letters the various provisions of an award, but on matters of substance, namely the different obligations which can be spelt out. For these reasons, I incline to the view that each separate obligation imposed by an award is to be regarded as a "term", for the purposes of s 178 of the Act. If the different terms impose cumulative obligations or obligations that substantially overlap, it is possible to take into account the substance of the matter by imposing no penalty, or a nominal penalty, in respect of breaches of some terms, but a substantial penalty in respect of others.

<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FMCA 714">In Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1384 , Heerey J approached the case on the footing that he should fix a quantum of penalty and reduce that by a discount to give effect to the various mitigating factors present (which were few). In a subsequent decision in McIver v Healey [2008] FCA 425 , Marshall J does not appear to have adopted this approach. </sentence>
