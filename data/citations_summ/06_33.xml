<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 606">The Act provides for the payment of costs. The primary rule as set out in section 67(1) of the Act is that ' the costs incurred by a party to proceedings instituted under Pt VI before the Tribunal shall be borne by that party' . That rule is intended to be given primacy. [1] The relevant exception to the general rule is found in section 67(8) which provides that: 
 Where, in any proceedings instituted by the claimant, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal makes a decision (a) varying a reviewable decision in a manner favourable to the claimant ... the Tribunal may, subject to this section, order that the costs of those proceedings incurred by the claimant, or a part of those costs, shall be paid by the responsible authority. 
  In addition, before the offer can be accepted as a Calderbank offer the terms of the offer must be ' clear, precise and certain' . [6] That requirement applies to the terms of the offer, the time within which the offer must be accepted, an indication that the offer is being made in accordance with the principles in Calderbank v Calderbank, and that there is some provision for costs separate from the principal claim. [7] The Tribunal finds that all four offers by Comcare met these requirements and left no reasonable doubt as to the nature and extent of what was being offered. [8]  Comcare also submitted that taking account of the principles in Perry v Comcare [2006] FCA 33 ; (2006) 150 FCR 319 (see below) and comments of the Tribunal in Re Hronopoulos and Telstra Corporation Ltd [2002] AATA 625 ; (2002) 68 ALD 419 at 421 concerning the need for parties to approach a conciliation conference in a realistic manner, it was not appropriate for Ms Brown to be awarded the whole of her costs of her proceedings.  In addition, before the offer can be accepted as a Calderbank offer the terms of the offer must be ' clear, precise and certain' . [6] That requirement applies to the terms of the offer, the time within which the offer must be accepted, an indication that the offer is being made in accordance with the principles in Calderbank v Calderbank, and that there is some provision for costs separate from the principal claim. [7] The Tribunal finds that all four offers by Comcare met these requirements and left no reasonable doubt as to the nature and extent of what was being offered. [8]  That exception grants the Tribunal discretion to vary the primary rule that each party must bear their own costs and to order that some or all of the costs in a proceeding shall be paid by the ' responsible authority' , [2] in this case, Comcare. In Perry v Comcare Greenwood J found that in exercising the discretion: 
 ..the Tribunal ought to have regard to the rule of primacy reflected in section 67(1), the circumstances of the case which gave rise to a decision enlivening the qualification upon section 67(1), the background circumstances concerning the claim, the nature and character of proceedings for the purposes of the SRC Act, the complexity of the claim and the conduct of the parties in relation to the proceedings . [3] 
  In the compensation jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeal Tribunal, it is accepted that if a Calderbank offer is made by the respondent, the offer is relevant to the discretion in relation to a costs decision. [4] However, the existence of the Calderban k offer cannot be determinative given the overriding statutory code in section 67. [5] In considering the offer, the Tribunal should also take into account the Policy Advice when assessing the conduct of Comcare and its legal representatives.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] VCAT 1230">It is true that the sentence goes on to say that the full and final settlement is of the compensation for legal expenses ordered by the tribunal. I take this to mean the compensation for legal and like expenses but not the costs of the tribunal proceedings. If it is meant to exclude Coryule's costs of the tribunal proceedings and that such costs will be met as an addition to the $33,500.00 it does not say so explicitly. I conclude that the offer of $33,500.00 is inclusive of costs to that date, and if it is not, then I regard it as ambiguous and unclear on that important point. A Calderbank offer or an offer subject to similar statutory provisions must be, in terms of Perry v Comcare [11] , "clear, concise, certain and capable of acceptance". Even without authority I think it is obvious that clarity and certainty are essential. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 965">The Court has stressed the importance of compliance with the requirement that a notice of appeal identify a question of law arising on the appeal. In Perry v Comcare [2006] FCA 33 ; (2006) 150 FCR 319 , Greenwood J stated (at [32]): 
 The practice of formulating the question of law to be determined by the Court as an element of demonstrating an error of law by the Tribunal is both procedurally important (and required) and designed to crystallise the proper analysis identified by their Honours at [107] of ASIC v Saxby . This practice should not be ignored and a failure to act consistently with the practice is apt to cause an appeal to miscarry for an appellant.

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 742">Although these cases are distinguishable because they concern the approach to cases of uncertainty of provisions within extant contracts there is no reason in principle why such an approach ought not to apply to the construction of an offer made pre-contract. That is, if the offer is one which is plain in its expression but is incapable of being applied to the facts it too must fail and cannot be capable of acceptance. [5] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] AATA 579">The costs power under s 67 of the SRC Act arises in an inter-parties context, involving elements of the adversarial process. Consequently, the scope of the discretion should be given a liberal construction and " ought not to be read down other than by reference to specific legislative constraints ". [19]  The discretionary power to order costs under s 67 of the SRC Act stands as a discrete head of power, once enlivened the functions of the Tribunal are not complete until the power has been exercised. [24] The discretion of the Tribunal to award costs pursuant to s 67 is unfettered by temporal considerations or by the need for an application. [25] That approach is consistent with subs 33(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 . Thus, once the discretionary power to order costs pursuant to subs 67(8), (8A) or (8B) of the SRC Act is enlivened in the particular circumstances of each subsection, the Tribunal is not functus officio until the power is exercised or expressly extinguished by operation of legislation, such as the exclusionary provisions of subs 67(11) or (12). [26]  The provisions of s 67 of the SRC Act are a code in the area of costs. [14] Even though the only provision of that section that is immediately relevant in the present case is subs 67(8A), it is desirable to consider that provision in the context of the section as a whole. The general rule is set out in subs 67(1): each party to a proceeding shall bear their own costs. Subs 67(2) to (12) set out the circumstances in which the general rule may not apply. [15] Subs 67(2) renders a responsible authority (as defined at subs 67(1A)) liable to reimburse a claimant for costs reasonably incurred in a proceeding that is rendered abortive in circumstances that are not presently relevant; if the particular circumstances are established, the liability to pay flows as a function of the subsection, without a determination by the Tribunal. Subs 67(3) to (7) inclusive concern the making of declarations in reference to subs 67(2) that are also not presently relevant.  There are a number of things to say about the costs code under s 67 of the SRC Act that are presently relevant. The discretion to order costs under s 67 involves the exercise of administrative power, in relation to which the Tribunal must act with " judicial detachment and fairness " and not " arbitrarily, capriciously or so as to frustrate the legislative intent ". [18]  The provisions of s 67 of the SRC Act are a code in the area of costs. [14] Even though the only provision of that section that is immediately relevant in the present case is subs 67(8A), it is desirable to consider that provision in the context of the section as a whole. The general rule is set out in subs 67(1): each party to a proceeding shall bear their own costs. Subs 67(2) to (12) set out the circumstances in which the general rule may not apply. [15] Subs 67(2) renders a responsible authority (as defined at subs 67(1A)) liable to reimburse a claimant for costs reasonably incurred in a proceeding that is rendered abortive in circumstances that are not presently relevant; if the particular circumstances are established, the liability to pay flows as a function of the subsection, without a determination by the Tribunal. Subs 67(3) to (7) inclusive concern the making of declarations in reference to subs 67(2) that are also not presently relevant.  If the discretion to order costs under subs 67(8A) is enlivened by an application of the requisite kind, there is no controlling rule or policy concerning the exercise of the power. [21] The discretion is broad and, subject to the exclusions at subs 67(10), (11) and (12) is only confined by considerations relevant to the case at hand. [22] Nevertheless, the discretion is subject to subs 67(1) and, therefore, the Tribunal should have regard to: (a) the rule of primacy set out in subs 67(1), (b) the circumstances of the case which gave rise to a decision enlivening the qualification upon subs 67(1), (c) the background circumstances concerning the claim, (d) the nature and character of proceedings for the purposes of the SRC Act, (e) the complexity of the claim, and (f) the conduct of the parties in relation to the proceeding. [23]  If the discretion to order costs under subs 67(8A) is enlivened by an application of the requisite kind, there is no controlling rule or policy concerning the exercise of the power.

[23]  The discretion under subs 67(8A) of the SRC Act is essentially preconditioned by the following factors: (a) the institution of any proceedings (the making of an application to the Tribunal for review of a reviewable decision [20] ) by the Commonwealth, (b) the incurring of costs of those proceedings by a claimant, and (i) the Tribunal varying or setting aside the reviewable decision in a manner less favourable to the claimant, in which case Comcare may be order to pay the claimant's costs, or (ii) any other case, in which case the Commonwealth may be ordered to pay the claimant's costs. </sentence>

One of those circumstances is provided by s 67(8) of the SRC Act which confers discretion upon the Tribunal to make an order that the costs incurred by a claimant, or part of those costs, be paid by the responsible authority, in this case the Commission, where either of the circumstances postulated in the subsection are made out. The discretion is unfettered but must be exercised having:

<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] AATA 103">In the normal course, each party to proceedings before the Tribunal shall bear their own costs (subs 67(1) of the Act). However, section 67 of the Act provides a code in relation to costs ( Riley v Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees (1994) [5] ). Subs 67(8) confers discretion on the Tribunal to order the responsible authority (in this case, Comcare) to pay a claimant's costs if the application is decided in terms that are more favourable to the Applicant. That discretion is curtailed in cases in which the reviewable decision is set aside and the particular matter is remitted to the determining authority for re-determination (subs 67(9)). Exercise of the discretion is essentially preconditioned by an outcome of the particular proceedings that is more favourable to a claimant than the decision under review, whether by varying or setting aside that decision. However, exercise of the discretion, once enlivened, is not mandated by the preconditioning factor alone. In order to alter the balance struck by subs 67(1) it is necessary to first consider the particular circumstances of the case. The nature and character of the proceedings, the complexity of the claim, the circumstances in which the costs were incurred, and the behaviour of the parties must be taken into account [6] . This is to be done with an eye to the requirements for justice and fairness in the particular case [7] . </sentence>

4 According to Greenwood J in Perry [2006] FCA 33 ; 150 FCR 319 at [76] :
 
 In exercising the discretion, the Tribunal ought have regard to the rule of primacy reflected in s 67(1), the circumstances of the case which gave rise to a decision enlivening the qualification upon s 67(1), the background circumstances concerning the claim, the nature and character of proceedings for the purposes of the SRC Act, the complexity of the claim and the conduct of the parties in relation to the proceeding . (Emphasis added. ) 9 The Senior Member referred to Perry [2006] FCA 33 ; 150 FCR 319 as authority allowing consideration of a "Calderbank letter" in the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 67(8). The Senior Member considered that the letter of offer in this matter satisfied the criteria set out in Perry 150 FCR at 327, 333-5, that it be clear, precise and certain, particularly with respect to the question of costs. 12 Perry 150 FCR at [89] makes it clear that it is not necessary that a Calderbank offer must conform to the principles dictating the validity of such an offer for it to be considered by the Tribunal in the exercise of its discretion under s 67(8). This is because the Tribunal is to have regard to the "circumstances of the case", and any such offer, regardless of validity, forms part of these circumstances. As outlined above, the Senior Member held that the Calderbank offer would not have been capable of being confirmed by the Tribunal, due to the principle in Lees [1999] FCA 753 ; 56 ALD 84. However, he seems to have reasoned that this prevented him from taking the offer into consideration when exercising his discretion as to costs. Such reasoning is incorrect in the light of Perry [2006] FCA 33 ; 150 FCR 319. This was an error of law in the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion, but it was an error in favour of, rather than against, the applicant. Even though the Senior Member purported not to consider the offer while exercising his discretion, he clearly outlined how he would have taken the letter into account, had he considered himself able to do so. Such treatment would not have been favourable to the applicant.  2 The legal principles governing costs in proceedings brought under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) (the SRC Act) are found in s 67 of that Act. Greenwood J in Perry v Comcare [2006] FCA 33 ; (2006) 150 FCR 319 at [65] - [66] made the following observations:
 
 The provisions of s 67 "constitute a code in the area of costs": Riley v Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees (1994) 48 FCR 449 per Beaumont J. The elements of that code are these. The primary rule, subject to the operation of the section is, "the costs incurred by a party to proceedings instituted under Pt VI before the Tribunal shall be borne by that party": (s 67(1)). Subsections (2) to (12) of s 67 provide specific circumstances where the primacy of s 67(1) might be displaced. (Emphasis in original. )</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2007] AATA 1379">Section 67 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 sets out matters concerning the costs of proceedings in the Tribunal, providing 'a code in the area of costs' [3] . The costs incurred by a party to proceedings are to be borne by that party [4] unless the Tribunal exercises the discretion conferred by subs 67(8) or other specified circumstances (which are not presently relevant) pertain. The discretion is broad and it is not controlled by any rule or policy, or fettered by any binding principle [5] . Exercise of the discretion is essentially preconditioned by an outcome of the particular proceedings that is more favourable to a claimant than the decision under review, whether by varying or setting aside that decision. However, exercise of the discretion, once enlivened, is not mandated by the preconditioning factor alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2007] VCAT 331">
 21 As I read the cited cases, the central tenet of the principles underlying such offers are that 'it can be said that the offer is clear, precise and certain for the purposes of the common law principles governing the construction of Calderbank offers of settlement' ; Perry v Comcar [2006] FCA 33. In that decision Greenwood J held that: 

'The respondent's letter of offer was not sufficiently clear so as to convey without any room for ambiguity that the applicant as a term of the proposed settlement would obtain his tax costs of the proceeding to the date of the offer. Accordingly, the letter of offer did not satisfy the central requirement of a Calderbank letter. '</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2006] AATA 965">That such an offer of compromise can be considered by the Tribunal in deciding whether costs might be withheld from an otherwise successful Applicant was made clear by the judgment of the Federal Court in Perry v Comcare [2006] FCA 33 ; (2006) 150 FCR 319 .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2006] FCA 481">4 The Tribunal's decision was the subject of an appeal heard by Greenwood J [2006] FCA 33. His Honour dismissed the appeal. In his Honour's view, whilst the letter did not amount to a 'calderbank' letter, that did not mean that the Tribunal was obliged to disregard it in the exercise of its discretion and order that the respondent pay the applicant's costs for the whole of the proceeding. That was a matter within its discretion. </sentence>
