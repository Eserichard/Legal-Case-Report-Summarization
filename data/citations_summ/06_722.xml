<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 885">The applicants rely particularly on O 35A r 3(2)(c) of the Rules, which does not require proof by way of evidence of their claim. Instead, on the face of the statement of claim, there must be a claim for the relief sought and the court must have jurisdiction to grant that relief: see Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 433 at [3] per Heerey J; Diesel SPA v Hwang [2005] FCA 1619 at [2] per Tamberlin J; Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 at [57] per Kenny J; and HIT Entertainment Ltd v Lodin [2006] FCA 722 at [5] - [6] per Stone J. Having read the statement of claim, I find that these conditions are satisfied. O 35A r 3 is, nonetheless, discretionary and the circumstances attending the application must be taken into account. In some circumstances, although not here, it is appropriate to exercise some caution before granting relief: see Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey t/as DVD Kingdom [2006] FCA 727 ; (2006) 232 ALR 525 at 527 [10] per Sackville J. </sentence>
