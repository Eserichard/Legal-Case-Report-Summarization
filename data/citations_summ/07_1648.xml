<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 161">3 From the summary made by the primary judge (see Marijancevic v Mann [2007] FCA 1648 (" Marijancevic v Mann ") at [6] and [7] of his reasons) of the evidence adduced at trial by Mr Marijancevic (also known as John William Henderson) and the Commissioner, and the material to which our attention was drawn, it can be said that there was before his Honour uncontested evidence to the following effect:
 
 
 &#8226; On 20 April 2002, Mr Marijancevic was arrested in Queensland in possession of approximately $620,000 in cash and was charged with possession of property reasonably suspected of being tainted and drug related offences. &#8226; On about 21 April 2002, without Mr Marijancevic's permission, the Queensland Police placed the money into a bank account nominated by the Police. &#8226; On 27 November 2002, the Queensland Police faxed to the Serious Non-Compliance Team of the Australian Tax Office profile information on Mr Marijancevic (referred to in the faxed document as "John William Henderson").</sentence>
