<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 261">The next matter which was asserted by the respondents in relation to the matter of costs addressed the issue of whether or not the respondents had been caused to incur costs by an unreasonable act or omission on the part of the applicant. In that regard, the provisions of s.824(2) have been helpfully explained by the Full Court in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) v Clarke, [6] where the Full Court stated that: 
 "As the authorities indicated there is a distinction between a party who pursues arguments which are ultimately abandoned or rejected by the Court and a party who commences a proceeding which is misconceived in the sense of being unsupportable. Simply because a party does not conduct its litigation in the most efficient way does not mean that the court should exercise its discretion in section 824(2) of the Act to make a costs order. In our view, neither the late abandonment of some of its defence, nor the use of a notice of contention to advance a previously minor and ultimately unsuccessful argument, crosses the threshold of being "an unreasonable act or omission" for the purposes of section 824(2). 
 
 Indeed, while courts should use the discretion in section 824(2) to ensure that parties to litigation arising from the Workplace Relations Act do not engage in unreasonable acts and omissions which put the other party to undue expense, they should also be careful not to exercise the discretion with too much haste, given that such haste may discourage parties, for fear of an adverse costs order, from pursuing litigation under the Workplace Relations Act in the manner which they deem best. "

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCAFC 87">1 This case concerns accessorial liability in relation to breaches of provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) as it stood in 2004 ("the Act") relating to a greenfields certified agreement. On 17 March 2006 a judge of the Court dismissed an appeal from judgment and orders of the Industrial Magistrate's Court of Western Australia imposing penalties upon the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ("the Union"), Michael Powell and Walter Vinicio Molina for breach of s 170MN of the Act in engaging in industrial action contrary to the terms and conditions of a certified agreement ( Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Clarke [2006] FCA 245 ; 149 IR 224). Notwithstanding that the Chief Justice had determined pursuant to s 25(5) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the appellate jurisdiction of the Court be exercised by a single judge ( Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Clarke [2005] FCA 986 ; (2005) 144 FCR 226) , it has been held, in this case, that there is an appeal from that judge to the Full Court ( Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Clarke [2007] FCAFC 8 ; (2007) 156 FCR 291).  16 When the primary judge came to express his conclusions in his reasons for judgment, the first heading was 'Whether Conduct of Union Members is Conduct of Appellants' and the second was 'Effect of Steps Taken by Appellants to Prevent Industrial Action'. In answering the first question, unfavourably to the appellants, the primary judge did not refer to, or consider, the effect of the evidence given as to the steps taken on behalf of the Union to prevent industrial action and encourage adherence to the Certified Agreement including the dispute resolution procedure. That, as the structure of the judgment shows, was to be given separate consideration. However, in considering that second question, the primary judge rejected the relevance of that evidence for reasons which are not supported by the respondent ([2006] FCA 245; 149 IR 224 at [46]---[67]). The result was that an important, perhaps crucial, aspect of the appellants' case was never considered. Appealable error having thus been established, the appeal to this Court must be allowed and this Court must consider the substance of the appeal from the orders of the Industrial Magistrate's Court of Western Australia for itself ( Zhang v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 30 at [17] ). As the jurisdiction being exercised by the primary judge was appellate, this does not create any particular difficulties in this case.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] WAIRComm 4715">In support of this submission, the CFMEU referred to CFMEU v Clarke [2006] FCA 245. There, Nicholson J at [61] stated, for the purpose of an alleged contravention of s170MN of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth), that a union was not a " separate juristic entity " from its members. In that paragraph and by reference to the rules of the union before the Court, his Honour said, " the Union consists of the Employees. The Union comprises every part of the Union. There is no constitutional concept of the Union on the one hand and the Employees on the other hand... The consequence is that if the Employees make a decision to go on strike, the Union is on strike. " The CFMEU, in these appeals, therefore argued in effect that if an organisation's member was, together with the organisation, involved in a dispute about payments due under s74(1) of the MSIA , that organisation was a party to the dispute. </sentence>
