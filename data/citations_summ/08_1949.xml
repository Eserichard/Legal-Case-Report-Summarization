<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 497">The Commissioner also relies on the amendment of the GST Act in 2008 by the addition of s165-5(3). That subsection provides that schemes entered into or carried out to put an entity in a position so as to be able to make an election which has the effect of reducing GST liability are not eligible for the concessional treatment afforded by s 165-5(1)(b). The Commissioner relies on the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill introducing the amending legislation to the effect that the amendment confirms the pre-existing law. The difficulty with this contention is that that Explanatory Memorandum was not before the Parliament at the time of passing the original legislation which did not have that provision. And, as Graham J observed in MW McIntosh Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [42] , 
"Needless to say, one cannot treat an Explanatory Memorandum in respect of a later Bill as extrinsic material to which reference may be made in discerning the meaning of an earlier statutory provision. "
