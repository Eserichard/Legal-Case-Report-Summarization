<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 762">Ms Cass submits that the correct approach to take to the application for summary dismissal is to: adopt a cautious approach and carefully consider the matter bearing in mind the primary obligation to permit the parties to be heard; [32] if, as a consequence of there being contested evidence which might be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed, then the Court's discretion to summarily dismiss must be exercised cautiously, and is not enlivened unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable; [33] and the alleged conduct of Kingston Capital complained of is anterior to the provision of financial product advice, so properly conduct in respect of which the TP Act applies. [34] Legislation
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 916">While in his written opening submissions counsel for the applicant tended to leave open the question whether s 51AF of the TPA applied in this case, in his closing written submissions he submitted that it did not and referred to my earlier decision in Avoca Consultants Pty Ltd v Millennium3 Financial Services Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 883 ; (2009) 179 FCR 46 at [231] - [238]. In Avoca , I held that a representation conveyed in an agreement whereby one person authorised another person to be their representative for the purpose of providing financial product advice was not an instance of the first person "engaging in conduct in relation to the providing of financial product advice". However, the circumstances of that case were quite different from those here. In my view, there is little doubt that the conduct and representations pleaded by Mr Clifford, in order to fix liability on the respondents for misleading or deceptive conduct, are "in relation to a financial product or a financial service", because they are connected with the acquisition of a security or securities. </sentence>
