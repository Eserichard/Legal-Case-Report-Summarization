<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 61">Mr Harvey conceded that the expression serious and imminent risk was not settled in its application to matters such as this before me. He referred to the analysis of that expression by Madgwick J in Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Graeme Boatman [2006] FCA 460 . While his Honour said the expression was difficult to comprehend fully in relation to all possible circumstances in which it might fall for consideration, he nevertheless agreed it was a composite phrase and that it was not appropriate to see serious as only referring to the risk of harm occurring. He said, in the context in which it appears in the CA Act, serious means something like really significant .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 866">5 By specific provisions which were inserted into the Act in 2003 there are provisions in Division 3A which deal with the suspension by CASA of particular authorisations. Those suspensions and the period during which they have effect are made subject to conditions including a requirement that CASA must apply to this Court within five days in order for the suspension to have continuing effect. The introduction of those legislative provisions and the policy reasons for them were discussed by a Full Court in Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Boatman [2004] FCAFC 165 ; (2004) 138 FCR 384 and referred to by Madgwick J in Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Boatman [2006] FCA 460. The new provisions were introduced in part to 'address the perception in aviation circles that CASA was somehow judge, jury and executioner' . </sentence>
