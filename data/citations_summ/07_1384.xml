<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 322">Plainly, the respondents have subsequently admitted liability and, at least, that element of co-operation, including the signing of the statement of agreed facts has obviated the need for a full hearing. The question however, arises as to what sort of discount ought be allowed for its admission and conduct. In this case, I find the observations of the Full Court in Glenn Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd [7] particularly helpful where the court noted adopting Branson J in Alfred v Walter Construction Group : [8] "The rationale for providing a discount for an early plea of guilty in a criminal case does not apply neatly to a case, such as the present, where a civil penalty is sought and the case proceeds on pleadings. Nevertheless, in our view, it should be accepted, for the same reasons as given in Cameron, that a discount should not be available simply because a respondent has spared the community the cost of a contested trial. Rather, the benefit of such a discount should be reserved for cases where it can be fairly said that an admission of liability: (a) has indicated an acceptance of wrongdoing and a suitable and credible expression of regret; and/or (b) has indicated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice.

It is clear that both specific and general deterrence are important criteria to be taken into account in setting pecuniary penalties ( CPSU, The Community &amp; Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Limited [2001] FCA 1364 at [9] ; 108 IR 228 , Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1847 at [60] ; [2005] FCA 1847 ; 224 ALR 467 ; 147 IR 462). Acknowledgment of breach may be grounds for mitigation of penalty as may be an apology to the persons concerned ( Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1384 ; (2007) 166 IR 33 at [114] ). In such cases, the timing of the acknowledgment will be important ( Alfred v Walter Construction Group Limited [2005] FCA 497 at [15] ).

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 422">Finally, in Glenn Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd [7] Heerey J at 99 noted: "As to the respondent's own financial position, however, in considering the size of the penalty, capacity to pay is of less relevance than the objective of general deterrence. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1417">RailCorp submitted that I should do so as all of the breaches related to cl 22.1 of the 2005 agreement. All arose out of RailCorp's mistaken belief that part of cl 3.10 of the 2002 agreement continued in force and qualified RailCorp's obligations under cl 22 of the 2005 agreement. All related to positions rather than individual employees. All were a consequence of one course of "multifaceted conduct" ( Klousia v TKM Investments Pty Ltd [2009] FMCA 208 at [75] citing Wells J in Attorney-General (SA) v Tichy (1982) 30 SASR 84 at 92---3, Gibbs v Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of the City of Altona [1992] FCA 374 ; (1992) 37 FCR 216 , Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 citing Quinn v Martin [1977] FCA 11 ; (1977) 16 ALR 141 at 143---145; Seymour v Stawell Timber Industries Pty Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 241 at 244 and 266-267, and Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Southern Cross Clothing Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 325 at [28] ). According to RailCorp, the facts in Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd (2007) 166 IR 33; [2007] FCA 1384 (affirmed in Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan (2008) 168 FCR 383 ; [2008] FCAFC 70) are distinguishable. In that case the employer applied duress to employees on separate occasions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 632">In relation to the respondents submissions filed 9 June 2009 and their arguments at paragraphs [5] to [12] in Glenn Jordan v Mornington Inn Proprietary Limited [2007] FCA 1384 at [91] it was said: "91...The statutory provisions are not directed to a continuing state of affairs, but rather conduct which answers a particular description. If there are episodes of conduct distinct in time or place, albeit related and engaged in with the same purpose, there will be separate contraventions. 
 To take an example discussed in argument, if an employer on each morning of a week threatened to assault an employee if he did not sign an AWA, there would be a contravention on each day. The evidence in relation to Ms Thompson is in essence no different: cf Carr v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2005] FCA 1802 at [12] and [16]. However, before penalties are finally fixed in respect of all contraventions, and not just those concerning Ms Thompson, I must look at the totality of all the unlawful conduct: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70 ; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 2) (2005) 215 ALR 281 at [14]. 92. Counsel agreed that the appropriate course would be to make declarations in respect of all contraventions, but to impose penalties only in respect of the duress (s 400(5)) contraventions, those being the more serious. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 36">I have considered the circumstances of other cases where employers have been penalised for contravening the duress provisions of the Act. These cases include the following: Smith v Granada Tavern &amp; Ors (No2) [2007] FMCA 904 ; Glenn Jordan v Mannington Inn Proprietary Limited [2007] FCA 1384 ; Jones v Hanssen Pty Ltd [2008] FMCA 291 ; and Mason v Sereo Sodexho Defence Services [2008] FMCA 373. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1470">65 The appellant referred to two decisions ( Byrne v Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd (2008) 169 IR 236 ; [2008] FCA 66 and Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd (2007) 166 IR 33 ; [2007] FCA 1384) to support his reliance on Belandra (2003) 126 IR 165 ; [2003] FCA 910 as a decision contrary to the trial judge's approach to construction. Both concerned penalties for contravention of Pt 16 (and its predecessor) and neither expressly dealt with any requirement over and above the terms of the prohibited reasons. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 714">In Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1384 , Heerey J approached the case on the footing that he should fix a quantum of penalty and reduce that by a discount to give effect to the various mitigating factors present (which were few). In a subsequent decision in McIver v Healey [2008] FCA 425 , Marshall J does not appear to have adopted this approach. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 646">76 No legal right or legitimate expectation of Ms Wills removed or threatened . Removal or threatened removal of something which can be characterised as a legal right or legitimate expectation is not an essential element of the concept of duress under the statute. In any event, with her established pattern of weekend work, an "unwritten agreement" as Mr Taylor termed it, Ms Wills plainly did have a legitimate expectation; cf Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1384 ; (2007) 166 IR 33 at [43] . Of necessity, a legitimate expectation is something less than a legal right.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCAFC 70">1 This is an appeal against the imposition of penalties for admitted breaches of s 400(5) and s 792 of the Workplace Relations Act 1966 (Cth) (the Act) based upon an agreed statement of facts. Those facts are summarised in the judgment below ( Jordan v Mornington Inn Proprietary Limited (2007) 166 IR 33 , [2007] FCA 1384 at [5] ---[87]) and need not be repeated in full. I would join Stone and Buchanan JJ in dismissing the appeal against the penalties imposed were it not for one issue --- the failure of the trial judge to apply the totality principle, firstly, to the contraventions in relation to Sharon Ann Thompson and, secondly, overall, leading to a result that is manifestly excessive.  

14 At that point his Honour correctly distinguished between the question as to whether there were separate contraventions and the different question as to the application of the totality principle. The later reference to the totality principle by his Honour was in the following context (166 IR 33 , [2007] FCA 1384 at [124] ---[125]):
 'The present contraventions are somewhere between a half ($15,000) and two-thirds ($20,000) of the way along the spectrum of seriousness, that is to say $17,500. After the rounding down mentioned I would impose a penalty of $17,000 in respect of each contravention. I have not drawn any distinction between the different contraventions, other than the Thompson ones where the result flows from the fact that there were six separate contraventions. 22 This appeal challenges the level of penalties imposed for admitted breaches of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the Act') when the appellant applied duress to four employees to sign Australian Workplace Agreements ('AWAs') and altered the position of those four employees, and another, to their prejudice for the prohibited reason that they were entitled to the benefit of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard established pursuant to the Act ( Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1384 ; 166 IR 33). 
  13 His Honour had said earlier (166 IR 33 , [2007] FCA 1384 at [90] ---[91]):
 'In the case of Ms Thompson, the agreed facts disclose six separate occasions when duress was applied and when, at the same time, there was injury in employment. The question arises whether as the respondent argues, there was, in respect of each statutory provision, only one contravention constituted by a course of conduct or whether there were six separate contraventions. 
 
In my opinion, the latter is the correct characterisation. The statutory provisions are not directed to a continuing state of affairs, but rather conduct which answers a particular description. If there are episodes of conduct distinct in time or place, albeit related and engaged in with the same purpose, there will be separate contraventions. To take an example discussed in argument, if an employer on each morning of a week threatened to assault an employee if he did not sign an AWA, there would be a contravention on each day. The evidence in relation to Ms Thompson is in essence no different: cf Carr v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2005] FCA 1802 at [12] and [16]. However, before penalties are finally fixed in respect of all contraventions, and not just those concerning Ms Thompson, I must look at the totality of all the unlawful conduct: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70 ; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 254 ; (2005) 215 ALR 281 at [14] . '  12 In the event, the judge imposed a penalty of $17,000 net of discount in respect of each contravention, including each of the six Thompson contraventions. That was a total of $102,000 for the Thompson contraventions --- well above the range indicated by counsel. His Honour said (166 IR 33 , [2007] FCA 1384 at [124] ):
 'I have not drawn any distinction between the different contraventions, other than the Thompson ones where the result flows from the fact that there were six separate contraventions. While there were different features of the conduct in each contravention, and some conduct may have affected some employees more than others, by far the most significant aspect is that they were all committed as part of a deliberate policy. '  ' 
(See also R v Holder [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 per Street CJ at 260 and McDonald v R [1994] FCA 956 ; (1994) 48 FCR 555. ) Another, related, principle is that it is wrong to punish an offender twice for the commission of elements of offences that are common ( Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [40] per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ). The Pearce principle was accommodated here as penalties were imposed for only the most serious of the two offences arising out of the same facts where both were applicable ( Jordan 166 IR 33 , [2007] FCA 1384 at [92] , [93] and [119]). These principles were discussed in Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15 ; (2004) 205 ALR 346 ; 78 ALJR 616 per Gleeson CJ at [3]---[5] and per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ at [18]---[35]. They were developed in relation to sentencing to imprisonment, with particular reference to concurrence of sentences.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 291">Conduct arising from a course of conduct cannot be treated as a single breach (unless there is a single breach) for the purposes of s. 407 of the WR Act . [15] Each separate AWA is "a workplace agreement" for the purposes of ss.337 and 341. Nevertheless the Court may take account of the fact that the conduct does arise out of a single course of conduct, if that is the case. [16] Where, as here, in relation to ss.337 and 341 of the WR Act , individual employees have been separately affected by like contraventions those contraventions are not to be treated as arising form a single course of conduct. [17] In those circumstances, the contravener is protected from a disproportionately harsh overall penalty by the totality principal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 101">Counsel for both parties are now in agreement as to the other relevant current provisions of the Workplace Relations Act , and the principles which I should follow when applying them. It is therefore not necessary for me to discuss them at length, since they have been identified in other recent decisions of this Court and the Federal Court (see, for example, Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 , Flattery v The Italian Eatery [2007] FMCA 9 , Cotis v Pow Juice Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 140 , Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 , Jordan v Mornington Inn Proprietary Limited [2007] FCA 1384 , Coles v Elsen Bros Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 1838 , and Dennington v Pee Cee Pty Ltd [2008] FMCA 79). At a factual level, these cases concerned a wide range of circumstances, and I consider it too early to discern a "tariff" of penalties usually awarded in this Court for underpayment of workers' entitlements. However, I have attempted to be consistent in this case with their approach to the determination of penalties. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 79">The applicant submitted the starting point was the maximum penalty. [13] In this case the maximum total penalty is $231,000.00 for the seven breaches. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 76">R v Shannon has been cited with approval in Glenn Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1384 and more recently in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617 at para.316. </sentence>
