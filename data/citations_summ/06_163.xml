<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] ATMO 78">The operation of this section of the Act has been considered in cases such as Pfizer [4] and more recently Bavaria NV [5] . In Pfizer , Gyles J said: 
"Connotation" is a secondary meaning implied by the mark. The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself. It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s 43 is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question, rather than, for example, deception by reason of similarity with other marks ( TGI Friday's Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday's Inc [2000] FCA 720 ; (2000) 100 FCR 358 at [43] , McCorquodale v Masterton [6] at [25] - [26]. </sentence>

An application by Pfizer Corporation for special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused: see [2007] HCA Trans 93. ) </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] APO 2">
 10. The provisions of Part 3 of Chapter 6 of the Act provide for the extension of term of standard patents relating to pharmaceutical substances. These provisions have now been considered in a number of decided cases and perhaps more relevantly for the current circumstances in H Lundbeck A/S v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 163 , in Pfizer Corp v Commissioner of Patents (No 2) [2006] FCA 1176 and on appeal to the full bench in Pfizer Corp v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCAFC 190. The latter also outlines in some detail the relevant provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Act .  
 33. Subject to any further judicial determination on the validity of the subregulation, there would seem to be no question that if only a single substance is claimed I am required to direct an amendment of the Register. Pfizer however contend in the case of multiple substances that the power to amend the Register does not exist unless it was shown that there is an earlier first regulatory approval date that applies to the particular substance on which the application for an extension of term was based. In this they rely on the decision in H.Lundbeck A/S v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2006] APO 18 where the Delegate observed: 
 
 "[21] Lindgren J has recently found that reg 10.7(7) is valid (H.Lundbeck A/S v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 163). The errors that are capable of correction under reg 10.7(7) relate to "the first regulatory approval date in relation to the pharmaceutical substance" (emphasis added). The pharmaceutical substance can only be the substance that was the basis of the extension of term (analogous to the interpretation of "the substance" above). Significantly reg 10.7(7) does not contain an equivalent to s 77(1), allowing amendment if there is an earlier date in relation to "any" pharmaceutical substance. Consequently, an amendment is required only if there is an earlier first regulatory approval date in relation to the substance which was used as the basis of the extension of term. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCAFC 190">35 The expression ' for any other purpose ' in s 228(2) does not signify that a regulation made literally for any purpose would necessarily be valid. The subject matter, purpose and scope of the Patents Act are obviously important. However, the purpose of regulation 10.7(7) is to ensure the particulars entered in the Patent Register are not false. If an extension were granted that should not have been granted, such that the entry in the Patent Register ought not to have been made, there ought to be a mechanism to correct that entry. Regulation 10.7(7) does no more than do so. The purpose of regulation 10.7(7) , therefore, is unexceptionable (see H Lundbeck A/S v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 163 at [46] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] FCA 1176">The validity of reg 10.7(7) was considered by Lindgren J in H Lundbeck A/S v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 163 ; (2006) 150 FCR 269. His Honour held that reg 10.7(7) is not invalid. Pfizer makes a ' formal submission ' that reg 10.7(7) is invalid but limits its submissions to that contention. Pfizer relies upon the submissions presented by the applicant in Lundbeck as reflected in his Honour's reasons but does not repeat them or otherwise explain why reg 10.7(7) is invalid. </sentence>
