<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 954">16 On the following day, 29 May 2008, SFC served an application on the respondents by which it sought orders from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (' AIRC ') pursuant to s 496 of the WR Act , requiring actual or threatened industrial action to stop or not take place. Before that application could be heard by the AIRC, I granted AMOU and SUA what is commonly known as an anti-suit injunction. This restrained SFC, pending the determination of proceedings in this Court, from taking further action in the AIRC to obtain orders pursuant to s 496 of the WR Act : Sydney Ferries Corporation v Australian Maritime Officers Union [2008] FCA 817. However, I set an early date of 13 June 2008 for the hearing of SFC's claims for final relief in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 960">2 On 29 May 2008, the second respondents filed a motion seeking an anti-suit injunction against SFC. AMOU filed a similar motion on 30 May 2008.
