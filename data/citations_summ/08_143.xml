<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCAFC 119">Nothing may, however, turn on this, and no point was taken by the Minister. Thus, in some cases, as for example, where a minor brings a proceeding for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, the Court has held that the proceeding may be brought and continued without the appointment of a friend or tutor: see Odhiambo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 194 ; (2002) 122 FCR 29 ; X v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 995 ; (1999) 92 FCR 524 ; and Jaffari v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 985 ; (2001) 113 FCR 10. Contrast Akpata v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1619 at [24] , [28]-[29], and also SZJXW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 143 at [10] - [11]. Where a friend has not been appointed, the application is not void ab initio, but instead is voidable: see R v Danaher; Ex parte Olzier Industries Pty Ltd [1969] VicRp 55 ; [1969] VR 445 at 446. In the instant case, however, it is clear that Ms W is acting on behalf of her son and it would probably be helpful to regularise the proceedings.</sentence>

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Introduction 
 In Welsh v Allblend Holdings Pty Ltd [1] this Court granted an interim application [2] by the respondent, Allblend Holdings Pty Ltd, [3] for leave to amend its response and defence and to institute a cross-claim against the applicant, Penelope Jane Welsh, [4] and a new respondent, 2B Wizards Pty Ltd.  In Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Clarke [11] the Full Court of the Federal Court said: [28] We turn now to s 824(2) of the WR Act. This provision carves out another exception to the usual rule in s 824(1) that costs orders are not to be made in respect of proceedings in a matter arising under the WR Act. The exception applies when two criteria are satisfied.</sentence>
