<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FWA 6519">7 See, for example, the decision of Madgwick J in Soh v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 520 at [100] - [102] and the cases there cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 304">34 This debate focused on whether a prisoner in Sleiman's situation had a right to what has been called in some cases "residual liberty", unlawful interference with which rendered his imprisonment unlawful and therefore compensable by damages. Mr Robinson referred to R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison; Ex Parte Hague; Weldon v The Home Office [1992] 1 AC 58 and relied on Prisoners A-XX Inclusive v State of New South Wales (1995) 38 NSWLR 622 , Soh v Commonwealth of Australia (2008) 231 ALR 425 ; [2008] FCA 520 (Madgwick J), Miller v The Queen [1985] 2 SCR 613 ; (1985) 24 DLR (4TH) 9 and May v Ferndale Institution [2005] 3 SCR 809 ; (2005) 261 DLR (4th) 541. I take them up in chronological order.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 32">On 18 April 2008 this application by Mr Soh was dismissed by Madgwick J: see Soh v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 520 , where his Honour has set out the history of the application and the issues involved. There is no need to repeat those matters in these reasons. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1524">3 In the proceedings before the primary judge, the applicant based his case on the following propositions (see Soh v Commonwealth of Australi a [2008] FCA 520 at [1] ). 
 
 1. Neither the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) nor any NSW legislation gave the governors of the respective prisons any lawful authority to detain him, and there was no other lawful authority for them to do so; the Commonwealth is said to be vicariously liable in damages for such false imprisonment by the governors. 
 2. Chapter III of the Constitution prohibits the Commonwealth from imprisoning a person merely unlawfully in Australia in a place of criminal detention except as part of the recognised criminal processes, following the laying of a criminal charge against the person; likewise any State law or arrangement facilitating such illegal imprisonment is also invalid. 
 3. Mr Furlong, the Operations Manager of Villawood who recommended to Departmental officers that Mr Soh be transferred to Silverwater, committed the tort of misfeasance in a public office.  1 The applicant in these proceedings seeks to appeal from a decision of a single judge of this Court of 18 April 2008: Soh v Commonwealth of Australi a [2008] FCA 520. The respondent, the Commonwealth of Australia, seeks an order that the applicant provide security for costs in the sum of $50,000. This judgment concerns that issue. In due course it will be necessary for the applicant to obtain an extension of time in which to appeal.
