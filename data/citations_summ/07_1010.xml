<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 902">There is no dispute that the Federal Court has jurisdiction by reason of s 86(1) of the Act. The dispute centres around the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ( the FCA) and the Rules. Section 4 of the FCA defines a "proceeding" as a ' proceeding in a court, whether between parties or not, and includes an incidental proceeding in the course of, or in connexion with, a proceeding, and also includes an appeal '. It is apparent from this definition that it applies to interlocutory matters and matters that may not be sufficient to dispose of all aspects of a dispute between the parties. It includes, for example, preliminary discovery ( Carnegie Corporation Ltd v Pursuit Dynamics plc [2007] FCA 1010 ; (2007) 162 FCR 375 per French J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 401">An application under O 15A r 6 is a proceeding in the Court, and the application itself commences the proceeding. I follow the decision of French J (as his Honour then was) on this point in Carnegie Corporation Limited v Pursuit Dynamics Plc [2007] FCA 1010 ; (2007) 162 FCR 375 (" Carnegie Corporation ") at 387-388 [48]-[53]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 996">In Carnegie Corporation Ltd v Pursuit Dynamics Plc [2007] FCA 1010 ; (2007) 162 FCR 375 (4 July 2007) ( Carnegie ), the applicant sought to serve process out of the jurisdiction pursuant to O 8 FCR. The question arose whether the application to the Court under O 15A, for an order that the prospective respondent give preliminary discovery to the applicant, was included within the expression "originating process" in O 8, r 3. French J noted that O 8, r 1 defined originating process as "an application commencing a proceeding...". His Honour referred to the definition of "proceeding" in s 4 of the FCA Act and noted that it provided a wide definition. His Honour stated at [53]: 
 
 In my opinion and consistently with the authorities in this Court an application for preliminary discovery is an application in a 'proceeding' within the meaning of that word in the Federal Court Act and therefore within the meaning of O 8. An application for preliminary discovery is therefore 'an application commencing a proceeding' and is within the new definition of 'originating process' in O 8 r 1. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1006">11 Senior counsel for the examinee submits that at least two or possibly three cases on which reliance was placed in my 26 May 2008 reasons were wrongly decided. Those cases are Fiorentino v Irons (1997) 79 FCR 327 and In the matter of Strarch International Limited (ACN 004 779 677 (In Liquidation) [2005] FCA 829. Additionally, to the extent to which Carnegie Corporation Ltd v Pursuit Dynamics plc [2007] FCA 1010 ; (2007) 162 FCR 375 followed those cases rather than Re Austral Oil Estate Ltd (in liquidation) (1986) 86 FLR 247 and Re Deposit and Investment Company Ltd (1991) 30 FCR 463 , counsel also argues that Carnegie was wrongly decided. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 762">
 

30 Although Strarch [2005] FCA 829 was decided prior to the amendments to O 8, the reasoning of Jacobson J (also following Fiorentino 79 FCR 327) remains entirely apposite and needs no repetition. In Carnegie Corporation Ltd v Pursuit Dynamics plc [2007] FCA 1010 ; (2007) 162 FCR 375 , French J (after the rule change) examined the issue in the context of an application for preliminary discovery but did so after observing in passing [51] that there had been rule changes since Strarch which in turn had followed Fiorentino . His Honour nevertheless reached an outcome consistent with the approach taken in those two cases, observing [48]-[53]:
 48 A necessary condition for service of process outside Australia, imposed by O 8 r 2, is that the process concerned be an "originating process". That condition must be met because it is O 8 r 2 that is relied upon by the applicants, rather than O 8 r 4 which provides for the service out of the jurisdiction of documents other than originating process. Service being achieved in accordance with any one of the methods set out in order 3 shall be deemed good and sufficient service of the Summons on the examinee. I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Supplementary Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice McKerracher. Associate:
