<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 45">In Winspear v Mackinnon [2008] FCA 322 , Marshall J made the following observations at [4]-[5]: [4] The defendants resist the plaintiff's claim for indemnity costs. They contend, correctly, that the usual course is that costs are payable on a party and party basis, unless the circumstances of the case warrant a departure from that normal course; see Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 233, per Sheppard J and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1844 at [3] and [17], per Gray J. [5] The categories of cases in which indemnity costs may be granted are not closed. The overriding consideration is the justice of the particular case. This includes the recognition that there are circumstances which justify the order of indemnity costs, including when a party unreasonably causes another party to incur costs; see Colgate-Palmolive at 233 and Leahy Petroleum at [17]. </sentence>
