<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 24">Merkel J at 43 made a similar point. His Honour pointed out that the problem arising in respect of an organisation representing members who have interests that may be affected by a determination is that the interests of the organisation are indirect. In other words, it is the interests of the members, rather than those of the incorporated association representing them, that may be affected in the relevant sense. The principles laid down in Byron Bay have been applied in a number of subsequent cases: Woodridge v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2001] FCA 419 ; [2001] FCA 419 ; (2001) 108 FCR 527 ; Dann on behalf of the Amangu People v Western Australia [2006] FCA 1249 ; Budby on behalf of the Barada Barna People v Queensland [2010] FCA 1017 ; Adnyamathanha People No 1 v South Australia [2003] FCA 1377 ; (2003) 133 FCR 242 ; Harrington-Smith on behalf of The Wongatha People v Western Australia [2002] FCA 184 ; Bisset v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 365 ; Davis-Hurst v New South Wales Minister for Land and Water Conservation [2003] FCA 541 ; Woodridge v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 1109 ; (2002) 122 FCR 190. </sentence>
