(2) section 74d of the act implied only a condition where the manufacturer supplied the goods to another person who acquired the goods for re-supply, it did not relate to an agreement between the manufacturer and consumer. further, the federal court does not have jurisdiction to grant relief in a claim arising solely pursuant to s.74d.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 711">2 The central issue in this proceeding was whether the Lowes had established that, on account of defects in construction and design, the truck was unfit for the purpose of interstate long-haul transport. If so, they claimed damages for breach of implied contractual conditions as to fitness for purpose and merchantability, relying on s 71 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TPA"): see Lowe v Mack Trucks Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 439 (" Lowe v Mack Trucks "). The Lowes also pursued a claim under s 52 of the TPA, to the effect that two of the respondent's sales representations were misleading and deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive. At trial, however, the Lowes failed to make out their case. In Lowe v Mack Trucks at [264], I concluded that the applicants had not shown that, on the balance of probabilities, the truck was not of merchantable quality and was unfit for the purpose of interstate, long-haul goods transport. Nor had they shown that the truck was other than as represented to them by the respondent's sales representative in March 1998.
