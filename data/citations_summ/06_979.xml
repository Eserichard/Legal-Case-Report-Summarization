<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 684">It is apparent that Tropicana's failure to post the security ordered on 19 November 2010, within the time limited by the order, enlivens the Court's jurisdiction to dismiss the proceeding pursuant to s 56(4) of the FCA and O 28 r 5(1)(b) of the FCR: Thunderdome Racetiming and Scoring Pty Ltd v Dorian Industries Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 291 ; (1992) 109 ALR 196 at 206 and Thirteenth Corp Pty Ltd v State [2006] FCA 979 ; (2006) 232 ALR 491 at [56] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] QCA 2">[7] There are a number of reasons why the application should be dismissed in its entirety. The seeking of the same relief in different proceedings at the same time, particularly in the same jurisdiction, may be an abuse of process. [1] Apart from anything else, it puts the respondent to unnecessary inconvenience and expense. The application was not made in a timely way. The decision appealed against was delivered on 6 August 2010 and the preparation for the appeal is well advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] VSC 405">10 The authorities demonstrate that it can be appropriate for the Court to exercise its power to stay a proceeding permanently where the plaintiff has brought two separate proceedings against the same defendant, whether in the same or a different court, in which the relief claimed is the same, where there is no reasonable justification for the two proceedings. [9] In my view this is not such an occasion. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] QCA 207">[42] 
[57] This Court was not referred to any decisions in which it has been held that the striking out of an action or defence for failure to comply with an order of the nature of the 3 April 2007 order on the grounds of abuse of process gave rise to issue estoppel or res judicata. [41] That is also the case with a judgment or order dismissing a claim or defence for failure to comply with an order for discovery. [114] The authorities to the effect that a judgment arising from non-compliance with an order for discovery does not give rise to any issue estoppel [97] are consistent with those decisions which established that the analogous case of a judgment dismissing proceedings for want of prosecution creates no issue estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] WASCA 57">16 Plainly, whether or not the second action should be characterised as an abuse of process, and the action struck out or permanently stayed, will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of the case. The relevant factors requiring consideration will include any explanation for the plaintiff's failure to comply with the springing order in the first action; the conduct of the plaintiff and the defendant in relation to the first action, including any failures to comply with the rules of court or interlocutory (including case management) orders and directions and any delays in the progress of the first action; whether any non-compliance with the rules of court or any interlocutory (including case management) orders or any delays in the first action by the plaintiff or the defendant were intentional or contumelious; any explanation for or failure to explain any such non-compliance or delays and any evidence or absence of evidence as to who was responsible for any such non-compliance or delays; the prejudice to the plaintiff if the second action were to be struck out or permanently stayed; and the prejudice to the defendant if the second action were not to be struck out or permanently stayed. Two points connected with the public interest are relevant in evaluating the seriousness (for the purposes of improper vexation or oppression to the defendant and disrepute for the administration of justice) of any failures to comply with the rules of court or interlocutory (including case management) directions and orders and any delays in the progress of proceedings. They are the public interest in the efficient conduct of litigation in the courts, including the limited judicial and other resources available for the achievement of that object, and the undoubted fact that proceedings which are the subject of frequent or chronic non-compliance with interlocutory (including case management) orders, delay or neglect consume a disproportionate share of judicial and other resources and, in consequence, adversely affect the judicial and other resources available to other litigants. The factors I have enumerated are not intended to be an exhaustive catalogue of the relevant matters in any case. Although a finding of intentional or contumelious conduct by the plaintiff in the conduct of the first action will be a significant factor in determining whether the second action should be characterised as an abuse of process, the existence of intentional or contumelious conduct on the part of the plaintiff is not an essential condition that must be established by the defendant before the second action may be struck out or permanently stayed. Generally see Deangrove Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2001] FCA 173 ; (2001) 108 FCR 77 [21] - [24] (Sackville J); Thirteenth Corp Pty Ltd v State [2006] FCA 979 ; (2006) 232 ALR 491 [32] - [35] (Jessup J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] VSC 566">
 
 251 Mr Lindberg said that both the Moore v Inglis [175] and Thirteenth Corporation Pty Ltd v State [176] proceedings had been commenced in two different courts. He submitted that in Branir Pty Ltd v Wallco Pastoral Co Pty Ltd, [177] Mildren J of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory held that an action in the same court as another action may be stayed on the grounds that it is vexatious and oppressive, just as it may be stayed where the actions are in different courts. [178] Mildren J referred to Finn J in Lidden v Composite Buyers Ltd [179] where he said: 
 
 
 It is the case that, where proceedings have been started in one court, it is an abuse of process to duplicate proceedings in another court when a complete remedy is available in the first court. It likewise seems the case that where proceedings are pending in a court, a separate action in the same court should at least by (sic) stayed where both actions involve the same parties and the same subject matter and where the hearing of the first will effectively dispose of the need for the hearing of the second. [180]  [214] 
(8) The rationale underlying the principle against double jeopardy, in that an individual should not be vexed twice for the same cause, is a factor properly to be taken into account in the weighing exercise: Walton v Gardiner. [215] 
(9) It is prima facie vexatious to bring two extant civil actions where one will lie: Moore v Inglis; [216] Thirteenth Corporation Pty Ltd v State. [217] 
(10) This prima facie rule applies whether or not the two proceedings are in separate courts or one: Branir Pty Ltd v Wallco Pastoral Co Pty Ltd [218] 
(11) The prima facie rule applies where the issues overlap or significantly overlap or there is a similarity of subject matters of the proceedings. (12) The fact that the parties may not be identical, or the relief different, does not necessarily disentitle relief under this principle: Moore v Inglis. [219] 
(13) In considering whether the rule should apply, the court should consider whether there was no reasonable justification for the second proceeding based on legitimate considerations of convenience, cost or the like: Thirteenth Corporation Pty Ltd v State. 
 
 259 Mr Lindberg submits that Sundberg J's view is correct. He contends that to find as a necessary element that the disposition of the first proceeding would effectively dispose of the second proceeding is inconsistent with the authorities, such as Moore v Inglis [185] and Thirteenth Corporation Pty Ltd v State, [186] on abuse of process. He contends that it would also mean that abuse of process principles giving rise to a stay would have no wider application than the principles of issue estoppel or res judicata.  (12) The fact that the parties may not be identical, or the relief different, does not necessarily disentitle relief under this principle: Moore v Inglis. [219] 
(13) In considering whether the rule should apply, the court should consider whether there was no reasonable justification for the second proceeding based on legitimate considerations of convenience, cost or the like: Thirteenth Corporation Pty Ltd v State. [220] 
(14) The guiding considerations are oppression and unfairness to the other party to the litigation and concern for the integrity of the system of administration of justice. Regard may be had to: 
(a) the importance of the issue in and to the earlier proceeding, including whether its is an evidentiary or ultimate issue; 
 (b) the opportunity available and taken to fully litigate the issue; 
 (c) the terms and finality of the finding as to the issue; 
 (d) the identity between the relevant issues in the two proceedings; 
(e) any plea of fresh evidence, including the nature and significance of the evidence and the reason why it was not part of the earlier proceeding; 
(f) the extent of the oppression and unfairness to the other party if the issue was relitigated and the impact of the relitigation upon the principle of finality of judicial determination and public confidence in the administration of justice; and 
(g) an overall balancing of justice to the alleged abuser against the matters supportive of abuse of process: Rippon v Chilcotin Pty Ltd. [221] 
 
  250 Jessup J referred in detail to Mason J's decision in Moore v Inglis. [173] He drew from it the following principle: 
 
 
 The important, perhaps critical, point was that the court in which the earlier proceeding was commenced had jurisdiction to deal with everything raised in the later proceeding and there was no reasonable justification, based on legitimate considerations of convenience, cost or the like, for commencing the second proceeding rather than seeking to amend the earlier. One sees the same underlying values as to the requirements of a fair and efficient system for the administration of justice here as are to be seen, in a different but analogous context, in Anshun . In the present case, were it not for one factor to which I shall turn next, I would consider that the commencement of the present proceeding was an abuse of process in the sense of being a course preferred by the applicant over what I would regard as the more obvious, more convenient, less costly and less vexing expedient of seeking to make the necessary amendments to the pleadings in the Victorian proceeding. The applicant was, as plaintiff in the Victorian proceeding, suing to achieve compensation for the very loss around which this proceeding is constructed. It was suing the same parties as are respondents here. Broadly speaking, it was putting the same series of transactions in 2000 into controversy. Had the Victorian proceeding still been on foot when this proceeding was commenced, I would have regarded the present case as covered by Williams v Hunt , and Moore . [174]  247 In Thirteenth Corporation Pty Ltd v State, [171] Jessup J of the Federal Court of Australia considered an application to stay proceedings instituted in the Federal Court against four directors of a company on the grounds that it was an abuse of process. Like Moore v Inglis, [172] the two proceedings were extant but one had been stayed. That turned out to be a critical factor. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] QCA 274">[59] There are dicta in Thirteenth Corp Pty Ltd v State [33] that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply where proceedings have been dismissed on account of default in compliance with orders for discovery or on account of default in the provision of particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1304">22 There has to be an end to litigation in the sense that, once an issue has been finally determined between particular parties, an attempt by the unsuccessful party again to agitate that issue against the successful party is subversive of the administration of justice. The authorities cited by her Honour, Reichel v Magrath (1889) 14 App Cas 665 , at 668-669 and Thirteenth Corp v State [2006] FCA 979 ; (2006) 232 ALR 491 , at 500 exemplify that proposition. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] VSC 245">83 Jessup J in Thirteenth Corp left open the possibility that the bringing of fresh proceedings might be considered vexatious and an abuse of process, although this would not necessarily be the case when a party had allowed proceedings to be terminated by his or her own default and commenced a new action on closely related grounds. [21] Judge Anderson took into account the absence of any explanation for Aussie Vic's failure to comply with his 30 March 2007 orders, as well as the absence of any material setting out the basis for the damages claim and went on to reach his conclusion that Aussie Vic had engaged in an abuse of process justifying the orders made.  80 Counsel for Aussie Vic and Mr Strangio challenges the correctness of the decision in Linprint, arguing that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply in a situation in which there has been no hearing on the merits. He, in turn, cites the Federal Court's decision in Thirteenth Corp Pty Ltd v State, [18] in which Jessup J stated that the principle did not apply where a proceeding had been discontinued or dismissed for non-compliance with orders for discovery or the provision of particulars or for want of prosecution. [19] Counsel contends that the factual sub-stratum in Thirteenth Corp was identical to that before Judge Anderson.  80 Counsel for Aussie Vic and Mr Strangio challenges the correctness of the decision in Linprint, arguing that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply in a situation in which there has been no hearing on the merits.

44 It follows from the above authorities that it will not be prima facie vexatious to institute proceedings in both a foreign country and Australia, but it will be so if the plaintiff has the same chance in each country and equal facility to obtain effective remedies.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 1758">13 In this case it is clear that, so far as concerns the first applicant, her claims for review of the decision of the Tribunal, and her grounds for such claims have already been the subject of earlier decision by the Federal Court, and are res judicata . Further, it is clear that an attempt to re-litigate matters already determined is an abuse of process and should not be entertained by the Court. In Reichel v Magrath (1889) 14 App Cas 665 at 668-669, Lord Halsbury LC said that it would be: 
 
 "...a scandal to the administration of justice if, the same question having been disposed of by one case, the litigant were to be permitted by changing the form of the proceeding to set up the same case again. ...it surely must be in the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to prevent the defeated litigant raising the very same question which the Court has decided in a separate action. "

Indeed, the patent abuse of process this case bears similar characteristics to cases dismissed by Moore J in SZASP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 , and I note as equally applicable to this case comments of his Honour at [1], [22] and [23].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FCA 1660">

12 More recently, as Jessup J observed in Thirteenth Corp Pty Ltd v State [2006] FCA 979 ; (2006) 232 ALR 491 at 500:
 
 "There is, of course, no shortage of authority for the proposition that it is an abuse of process for a party to seek to contest, in later proceedings, a point which it has lost, or substantially lost, in earlier proceedings, even where there may not be complete overlap between all facts, parties, and causes of action...: see, for example, Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police [1981] UKHL 13 ; [1982] AC 529 ; [1981] 3 All ER 727 ; Haines v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1995] NSWSC 136 ; (1995) 43 NSWLR 404 ; Rippon v Chilcotin Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 142 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 198. " 
 

(cf the Full Court in Wilson v Commonwealth of Australia [1999] FCA 1308 at [11] - [12]; Finn J in Lidden and Anor v Composite Buyers Ltd &amp; Ors (1996) 139 ALR 549 ; Haines v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1995] NSWSC 136 ; (1995) 43 NSWLR 404 at 414)

 45 Jessup J put it slightly differently in Thirteenth Corp Pty Ltd v State [2006] FCA 979 @ [36]: 

'.... it is at least regarded prima facie as an abuse of process for a moving party to vex his or her opponent by instituting multiple proceedings to right a single wrong. '</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] VSC 60">5 In the course of argument before me, it was submitted that the proceedings in this court with respect to the third party, Mr Velos, constituted an abuse of process and should be stayed. Essentially it was put that it was an abuse of process to carry on without good reason two cases about the same thing in two, or even more, different places. Reliance was placed upon the observations in Moore v Inglis , [1] Logan v Bank of Scotland (No.2) , [2] and also a more recent judgment in Thirteenth Corp Pty Ltd v State and Ors . [3] </sentence>
