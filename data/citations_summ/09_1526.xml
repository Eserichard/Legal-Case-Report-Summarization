<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1418">On 25 June 2008 the Department sent Mr Islam a notice of its intention to consider refusing his application for a business visa on the basis of his failure to meet the character test. A delegate of the Minister subsequently refused Mr Islam's application. Mr Islam sought review of that decision and the Migration Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision. However, the Federal Court set aside the Migration Tribunal's decision. The basis for the Court's decision was apprehended bias on the part of the Migration Tribunal, as the Migration Tribunal member who heard the review had issued a warrant under the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 (Cth) permitting the Australian Federal Police to use a listening device in relation to communications by Mr Islam ( Islam v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1526). The matter was remitted for review to the Tribunal, which was differently constituted. The Tribunal decision is now the subject of this application. </sentence>
