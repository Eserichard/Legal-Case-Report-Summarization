<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] NSWSC 1350">9 Proceedings were initiated in the Federal Court at Melbourne arising from disputes over entitlements to the patent. Prismex, X-Position and Keller were all parties to those proceedings. In a judgment delivered on 14 November 2006 ( Prismex Technologies Pty Ltd v Keller Industries Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1504) Jessup J in essence upheld the entitlement of Prismex to the patent and to certain physical items embodying details of the relevant method of manufacture. There were also findings regarding rights (or absence of rights) of others. In particular there was a finding that Interium did not have any licence and therefore had nothing to assign to Keller. Those proceedings have been adjourned so that questions of remedies may be addressed, the questions of liability having been already determined.</sentence>
