<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 521">I accept that the parties wish to avoid a lengthy taxation. Nevertheless, I do not feel able to apportion the costs as requested. I refer to my observations in BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (No 2) [2007] FCA 557 at [47] : 
 
 It is sometimes preferable after apportioning issues as I have done to avoid leaving the quantification and fixing of costs of those issues to taxation. I am mindful that an allocation of costs in the case of a mixed result can rarely be achieved with mathematical precision and such is not necessary: Dodds 26 IPR at 272 per Gummow, French and Hill JJ. Unfortunately, I do not have any appropriate material to estimate the amount of costs or time spent on the preparation and consideration of the economic test prior to trial, and so cannot make any percentage apportionment of the costs to be discounted. I therefore propose to order a deduction in the costs awarded to the NCC by reference to the NCC's points of defence and amended points of defence which will unfortunately leave the quantification and fixing of costs of the economic test issue to taxation in default of agreement between the relevant parties. 
 
  All parties' proposed orders contemplate that the same costs orders should be made in each proceeding involving the same parties, although there is disagreement as to what the orders should provide. Having the same costs orders in the proceedings involving the same parties will make the process of taxing costs simpler than would be the case if some proceedings were to be dealt with separately, given that the evidence before the Court in the Esso proceedings was treated as evidence in all of the proceedings. I am content to proceed in this way: see BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (No 2) [2007] FCA 557. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1474">Such an exercise of power was invoked in Dr Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 602. The Applicants in that case had commenced four separate proceedings against four different groups of respondents. In apportioning costs, Goldberg J there said: 
 
 [95] If it be accepted that it is appropriate to have multiple proceedings heard together, where there are common issues of fact and law involved, for the purpose of reducing costs and having an efficient and economical use of court resources, it is also appropriate to consider whether in such circumstances there should be variations to the usual order as to costs. In particular it is appropriate to give consideration to the apportionment of the costs of an applicant incurred in relation to issues and matters common to those proceedings between those proceedings where the applicant is successful and those proceedings where the applicant is unsuccessful. 
 

 
In BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (No 2) [2007] FCA 557 at [11] , the parties were apparently in agreement that a " global order for costs " should be made in the circumstances where two proceedings had been heard together. And in Campaign Master (UK) Ltd v Forty Two International Pty Ltd (No 5) [2010] FCA 545 three motions had been filed in two proceedings and had been heard together, with mixed success for each party. Each party was ordered to bear his or its own costs in relation to the motions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] SADC 167">Held: The defendant should pay all the plaintiff's costs on a solicitor/client basis. Dust Diseases Act 2005 s 9(3) , referred to.

 I delivered judgment in this matter on 23 July 2010. The plaintiff's claim was for damages for asbestos related injury and disability suffered by him when he worked with materials containing asbestos which had been manufactured by the defendant. The defendant submits that there is some assistance to be found in identifying criteria for denying costs in BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (No 2) [2007] FCA 557 at [23] . Middleton J said that one should consider: 
 
 Appropriate case management principles, the relative merits or strengths of the lost issue or enquiry, whether the length of the proceedings have been greatly increased by the lost issue or enquiry in which the successful party failed, and whether the issue or enquiry in which the successful party failed was of sufficient significance in proportion to the whole case to warrant a special order to deprive that party of the costs of that issue. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1385">As the parties accept, the Court has a general discretion under s 43(2) FCA to award costs, but the discretion must be exercised judicially: Australian Trade Commission v Disktravel [2000] FCA 62 (at [3]). Ordinarily, absent a contrary statutory provision, costs follow the event and a successful litigant will receive his or her costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order: Ritter v Godfrey (1920) 2 KB 47 as cited in Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (986) ATPR 40-748 at 48,136. This has been held to be the case even if the losing party had good legal grounds for its position and conducted itself in the litigation reasonably and appropriately: Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (at 235); BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (No 2) [2007] FCA 557 (at [27]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1172">Accordingly, I am satisfied that on the principal issue in each of the proceedings the Commissioner's position was accepted. Once it became apparent at the pre-trial conference that BSCM was prepared to accept the effectiveness of its resolution to accumulate its net income, the assessment under s 102UM effectively became unnecessary or redundant. It is appropriate to determine the appropriate orders for costs in that light. There is ample precedent for doing so: Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association Inc (1986) 8 ATPR 40-748 ; BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (No 2) [2007] FCA 557 at [27] ; Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 12; Bowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCAFC 107 at [3] - [5]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 646">It has long been the case that the Court may make a costs orders that reflect the success of the parties on individual questions of fact and law: see Hughes ; BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (No 2) [2007] FCA 557 and Bowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCAFC 107. It is clear that the applicant succeeded on its trade practices claim, notwithstanding that I am not prepared to make the declarations or grant the injunction sought by the applicant. Qantas accepted that even if no such orders were made, the applicant's success on the trade practices claim could be brought to account when determining what costs order should be made. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 492">A number of issues were argued before the Court. The Court may make costs orders reflective of success on individual questions of fact and law: see Hughes v WA Cricket Association (Inc) [1986] FCA 382 ; (1986) ATPR 40-748 ; BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (No 2) [2007] FCA 557 and Bowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCAFC 107. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 601">18 As to the time spent on objections to admissibility of affidavit evidence, in many instances objections taken by Bickfords were unsuccessful. However, some objections taken were successful, and Hansen was given the opportunity during the trial to mend its hand. In particular, Bickfords' objections to Mr Alford's evidence were successful, which took up a significant part of the hearing and submissions. Nevertheless, I have come to the view that this is not a case where Bickfords was involved in 'the injudicious pursuit of issues without substance' (see eg Stena [2007] FCA 1141 at [12] ) or was involved in any unreasonable or inappropriate conduct (see eg BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (No 2) [2007] FCA 557 at [18] ). In this proceeding the evidence and its presentation were important, and Bickfords was entitled to take the objections, although some were not upheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] NSWSC 348">27 The application for leave to appeal was ultimately unsuccessful on all grounds. The costs principles that enable the Court to apportion costs against a successful litigant in relation to a distinct or severable issue or inquiry, accordingly does not arise in the present circumstances. The costs principles that apply in civil litigation, where a successful litigant has failed on a particular severable issue and the relevance thereto of the exercise of a court's discretion as to costs has recently been reviewed in BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Limited v National Competition Council (No 2) [2007] FCA 557 per Middleton J at [25] and [27].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] NSWSC 303">73 The question of the costs of a successful litigant who fails on one or more issues, was also discussed: see Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) [1986] FCA 382 ; [1986] ATPR 40-748 per Toohey J at 48, 136 and Cummings v Lewis (1993) 41 FCR 559 at 602-603. The principles that apply to the costs of a successful litigant were recently reviewed in BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Limited v National Competition Council (No 2) [2007] FCA 557. In that case, Middleton J stated:-
 

 
 
 
 "(18) There must be some element connected to the proceeding to make it fair and reasonable to deprive a successful litigant of its costs. A good reason not to follow the ordinary rule may arise because of the unreasonable or inappropriate conduct of the successful litigant.</sentence>
