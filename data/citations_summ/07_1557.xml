104. The independence or otherwise of legal advice given by the Legal and Advice Branch of the Office of Workplace Services (OWS) arose in the case of Rilstone v BP Australia Pty Ltd [145] ( Rilstone ). Besanko J found that the OWS was an executive agency within the responsibility of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. The documents over which legal professional privilege was claimed had been created during the course of an investigation carried out by the OWS. He concluded:
 
" In this case the applicant might have put forward more detailed evidence as to how the Legal and Advice Branch, was the decision-maker operated and its role in the OWS organisation. However, in my opinion, this case has similarities with the facts in Waterford and ... the necessary degree of independence has been established or, put another way, it has been established that the Legal and Advice Branch was a legal adviser for the purposes of legal professional privilege. " [146]

Telstra (No 2) has not subsequently been cited as supporting the proposition the respondents advance. [16] </sentence>
