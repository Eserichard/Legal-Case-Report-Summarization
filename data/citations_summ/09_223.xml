<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 66">In respect of s.789 of the WR Act proof of the requisite intent is necessary. [8] The authorities with respect to the phrase " with intent to coerce " in s.789 of the WR Act make it clear that: it is necessary that a threat of action involving an intention to coerce must have the capacity for compulsion on its recipient; the capacity for compulsion on its recipient must enable the Court to conclude that it was intended that pressure be exerted which, in a practical sense, was such as to negate choice; the pressure must involve conduct that is unlawful, illegitimate or unconscionable; the maker of the threats must have actual knowledge of the circumstances that make the conduct coercive; and where the threats or conduct have several purposes or objectives, the proscribed intent or reason must be a substantial or operative intention in the making of the threats or the carrying out of the conduct. [9] False or misleading representation
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCAFC 13">The meaning of the phrase "intent to coerce" in this statutory setting has become settled (see Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2000] FCA 1468 ; (2000) 106 FCR 16 per Gyles J at [18]-[38]; National Union of Workers v Qenos Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 178 ; (2001) 108 FCR 90 per Weinberg J at [128]; Seven Network (Operations) Ltd v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia [2001] FCA 456 ; (2001) 109 FCR 378 ( "Seven Network" ) per Merkel J at [38]-[43]; Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 223 ( "Williams" ) per Jessup J at [105]). The relevant principles were distilled by Merkel J in Seven Network in the following terms (at [41]): 
 
 First, it needs to be shown that it was intended that pressure be exerted which, in a practical sense, will negate choice. Second, the exertion of the pressure must involve conduct that is unlawful, illegitimate or unconscionable. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 688">While the conduct of the employees might not amount to a " ban ", as it did not involve a total prohibition of the work in question (see NMHG Distribution Pty Ltd t/as Yale Asia Pacific v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union and Others (2000) 104 IR 158 at 162), the approach taken to the meaning of the words " limitation or restriction " by the Federal Court in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2009) 179 IR 441 ; [2009] FCA 223 is in point. In that case, in considering the meaning of the concept " ban, limitation or restriction " in s.36(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (which is, relevantly, in identical terms to s.19(1)(b) of the FWA) Jessup J stated the following (at [90]): ... In NMHG Distribution Pty Ltd (t/as Yale Asia Pacific) v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (2000) 104 IR 158 , a Full Bench of the Commission said the following of the word "ban" in a statutory context indistinguishable from that with which I am presently concerned (at [11]): The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary includes the following meaning for the word "ban": "a formal or authoritative prohibition (on or against something)".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 754">The application of ss 43 and 44 of the BCII Act to the circumstances of the meeting of workers on 13 March 2009 is more straightforward. I accept that Mr Stephenson's whole program in relevant respects (including his telephone conversation with Mr McElligot on 12 March) amounted to "action" within the meaning of these sections. His obvious intent was to procure the cessation of the only productive work which was then being performed on the bridge. Although he gave Mr McElligot a choice to comply with his program (a choice which was, as it happens, rejected in the telephone conversation), and although he gave the workers a choice of sorts at the meeting on 13 March, Mr Stephenson had the intent of procuring the cessation of work, and the effect of his success in that regard would have been to add to the pressure on John Holland to comply with the CFMEU's demands, and in that sense to negate choice. In this respect I would take the same approach to the matter as I did in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 223 ; (2009) 179 IR 441 , 477-478 [106]. The means employed were, on any view, illegitimate. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 48">The prior contraventions by Mr Mates of the BCII Act are contraventions of s 43 of the BCII Act arising out of conduct on: 15, 17 and 21 February 2006; Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) [2009] FCA 52 (contraventions recorded 5 February 2009); and 31 July 2006; Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 223 (contraventions recorded 13 March 2009). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1040">Further, on 13 March 2009, in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 223 , Jessup J found that, on 31 July 2006, Mr Mates and the Union had committed two breaches of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act by organising a stoppage of work on a building site and threatening to organise a further stoppage unless the employer engaged a labourer. On 28 May 2009, Jessup J dealt with the matter of penalties: see Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548. (With the consent of the applicant, the respondents advised me that this last-mentioned judgment was the subject of an appeal. )  Jessup J's judgment in Williams [2009] FCA 223 was delivered on 13 March 2009, and involved findings that, on 31 July 2006, Mr Mates and the Union had each committed two breaches of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act . Whilst these breaches cannot be treated as prior contraventions, they can be taken into account in imposing penalties in this case. I note, of course, that they involve judicial findings made earlier this year in respect of conduct five months after 15 February 2006. These considerations affect the weight to be given Williams in imposing penalties here.  Until Jessup J's decision in Williams [2009] FCA 223 , Mr Mates had not been found to have contravened s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act or any other industrial legislation. The applicant referred to Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1804 ; (2008) 178 IR 47 , in which, on 28 November 2008, Marshall J found that, in October 2005, the Union had contravened s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act . Although the report of the case indicates that Mr Mates was involved in the events resulting in the contravention finding against the Union, there was no finding of contravention against Mr Mates. Further, for present purposes, I accept that s 38 involves consideration of facts of a different kind to that involved in a s 43 contravention.  Much the same must also be said of Williams [2009] FCA 223 and Williams (No 2) [2009] FCA 548. Consideration of them is helpful, but ultimately the factors relevant to the imposition of penalties differ. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 613">Both counsel referred me to numerous authorities in the Federal Court which have considered similarly worded provisions of this Act and its predecessor legislation. In particular, they both submitted that the previous approach to prohibitions on threats of action "with intent to coerce" a defined outcome, should be applied by me. These authorities were recently applied by Jessup J in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union [2009] FCA 223 , (2009) 179 IR 441 , and I do not consider it necessary for me to trace their preceding development. In particular, I accept that it is necessary that a threat of action involving an intent to coercion must have a capacity for compulsion on its recipient, so that it can be concluded that "it was intended that pressure be exerted which, in a practical sense, will negate choice" . It is also necessary that the pressure "must involve conduct that is unlawful, illegitimate or unconscionable" , and that the maker of the threats "had actual knowledge of the circumstances that made [his] conduct coercive" in that sense (see Merkel J in Seven Network (Operations) Ltd v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia [2001] FCA 456 ; (2001) 109 FCR 378 at [41] - [43], cited in Williams (supra) at [105]). I also accept that if the threats had several purposes or objectives, the proscribed intent or reason must be "a substantial or operative" intention in the making of the threats (cf. Williams (supra) at [103]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 548">On 13 March 2009, I made findings that the respondents had each contravened s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) ("the BCII") in two respects: Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 223. I have now heard the parties on the final orders which should be made, and on the question of costs. These reasons deal with those matters. They should be read together with my reasons of 13 March 2009. </sentence>
