<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] ATMO 34">Mr Ricketson was also critical of the applicant's reliance on usage of YELLOW with other trade marks. He acknowledged the case law relevant to the use of two or more trade marks together [8] . However, as he said, the outcome of such usage depends on a careful analysis of the facts of each particular case. Relevantly, in Sports Warehouse : 
Where an application for registration relies on use, the question is whether the particular sign for which registration is sought has itself been used as a trade mark so as to become capable of distinguishing the relevant goods or services. In my view, when the "TW" logo was placed in close association with the words "TENNIS WAREHOUSE" in 2003, this had the effect of substantially diluting any trade mark significance that attached to the words "TENNIS WAREHOUSE" by themselves. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1367">I do not consider that any party before me sought to reformulate this test. Each party accepted it as the current and correct statement of the law. To the extent it was suggested otherwise, I do not consider that Foster J in Alcon Inc v Bausch &amp; Lomb (Australia) Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1299 was suggesting any reformulation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] ATMO 113">In its submissions the applicant pointed me to the decision of Foster J in Alcon Inc v Bausch &amp; Lomb (Australia) Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1299 , arguing that the decision was directly on par with the situation in this opposition. I consider there are certainly some similarities between the cases, but I am of the opinion that this trade mark is much less obviously an acronym than was the case with the trade mark BSS, described as an acronym for "balanced salt solution". It therefore does not face quite the same number of hurdles in reaching a successful conclusion. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCAFC 117">52 This contention overlooks that the primary judge, speaking of the statutory defence, said (at [42]):
 To rely on this defence, the respondent must show it acted honestly and without any ulterior motive. See Johnson &amp; Johnson Australia Pty Limited 30 FCR 236 per Gummow J at 353-354; Alcon Inc v Bausch &amp; Lomb (Australia) Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1299. </sentence>
