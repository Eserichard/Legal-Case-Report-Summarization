<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1315">I do not think this argument is correct. The Court has power under the Act to decide whether or not a document purporting to be a statement of affairs prepared by a bankrupt is sufficient for the purposes of s 54 of the Act: see Wangman v Official Receiver, Insolvency &amp; Trustee Service Australia [2006] FCA 202 (Collier J) at [55] and s 30(1)(a) of the Act. And it also has power to make an order requiring that another document be prepared in the event that the former contains material deficiencies: see s 30(1)(b) of the Act. Section 30(1) "is intended to give the Court wide powers to give effect to and carry out the Act": Tyler v Thomas [2006] FCAFC 6 ; (2006) 150 FCR 357 at [13] per Branson J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1614">Because of the findings made earlier in these Reasons for Judgment it is unnecessary to express a view on the applicability of s.33A of the Bankruptcy Act to the facts of this case. [56] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 1576">
 
 10. While each of the bankrupts provided a signed statement of affairs to the Official Receiver, each of those documents is said be incomplete in that certain details are not included and elsewhere "nil", "unknown" or "TBC" is stated in response to particular questions in the statements of affairs. It was submitted for the applicant that in light of the Federal Court's decision in Wangman v Official Receiver [2006] FCA 202 the trustee could not be reasonably satisfied of the validity of the purported statements of affairs filed by each of the respondents and that it could be said that the respondents each had failed to "make out and file" a statement "of his or her affairs" so orders were sought that the trustee was entitled to proceed to distribute a dividend amongst creditors. It was submitted that the Court had the power to make such orders pursuant to s.146 or alternatively under s.30(1) of the Bankruptcy Act . 26. In support of the contention that a lack of information in a statement of affairs can mean that such document is not a valid statement of affairs within the meaning of s.54(1) of the Act, reliance was placed by the trustee on obiter remarks by Collier J in Wangman v Official Receiver [2006] FCA 202. </sentence>
