<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1304">20 The application which succeeded before her Honour highlighted an identity between paras 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 of the "Details of claim" and para 2 and para 3 in the "claim for Interlocutory Relief" with the proceeding the subject of the judgment delivered by Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371. To this extent, it was submitted that the present proceeding was an abuse of process, an attempt to re-litigate a proceeding already determined. Further and in any event, the present Respondents submitted that Mrs Rogers had no reasonable prospect of success such that the proceeding should be dismissed pursuant to the power conferred on the Court by s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act . 26 In Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 1371 , at [36] to [48] Spender J summarily stated his conclusions in respect of proceeding QUD525/2005, having regard to earlier and other proceedings which had been filed in this Court and elsewhere by Mrs Rogers or, as the case may be, Mr Rogers. It is instructive to reproduce his Honour's summary:
 
 
 "36 I have analysed the extensive Statement of Claim in considerable detail. I have had regard to the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434 and the reasons for judgment of Collier J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1708. 24 Collier J conducted an analysis of the relief sought in the application, the claims made by Mrs Rogers in the present proceeding and that which she had sought and made in an earlier proceeding in this Court - proceeding QUD525/2005. In that earlier case, q v Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 1371 , at [9], Spender J had observed of Mrs Rogers' application:
 "9 It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that these proceedings in the name of Lynne Maree Rogers have been instituted, and then resurrected, because earlier proceedings brought by the applicant's husband were the subject of orders of dismissal in the light of the bankruptcy of Gregory Rogers and the decision by his trustee in bankruptcy not to pursue those proceedings. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1305">14.06.07 Mrs Rogers commenced proceeding QUD173/2007 against the First to Seventh Respondents, seeking virtually the same relief claimed in proceeding QUD525/2005 (which as at the time remained reserved by Spender J) and relief on the same facts, matters and circumstances. 30.08.07 Justice Spender dismissed proceeding QUD525/2005, with costs. Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 1371. 01.11.07 Justice Collier dismissed proceeding QUD173/2007, with costs. Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 1660. 7 The Respondents submitted that it was relevant also to take into account, as part of the background to their application, litigation that Mr Rogers' wife, Lynne Maree Rogers ("Mrs Rogers") had come to institute in the Court. Having regard to the events and proceedings listed in the chronology below and to an observation made by Spender J in one of those proceedings that: "It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that these proceedings in the name of Lynne Maree Rogers have been instituted, and then resurrected, because earlier proceedings brought by the applicant's husband were the subject of orders of dismissal in the light of the bankruptcy of Gregory Rogers and the decision by his trustee in bankruptcy not to pursue those proceedings" ; Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 at [9] , I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1660">28 In any event, having regard to the decision of Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 , it is clear that the applicant would be no more successful on the material before me in claiming relief under the ASIC Act than she was before his Honour in claiming relief under the Trade Practices Act . In light of the principles articulated by Lindgren J in White Industries [2007] FCA 511 , it is plain that the claim has no reasonable prospects of success in terms of s 31A Federal Court Act.
  "
 

6 There is history to this dispute which has involved both the applicant and her husband bringing a number of claims in this Court against the respondents. The applicant and Mr Handran for the respondents have drawn my attention to:
 
&#8226; the decision of Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 
 
&#8226; the decision of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 195 
 
&#8226; the decision of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 434 
 
&#8226; my decision in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1708. 7 The application filed in QUD525/2005, upon which judgment was given by Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 , is annexed to the affidavit of Mr Sean Whittle sworn 19 June 2006 and filed 20 June 2006 in these proceedings. The application in that matter stated that it was a "Claim for Relief under the Trade Practices Act ". The Details of Claim were described as:
 
 
 "A. 9 The respondents seek dismissal or stay of the substantive proceedings before me on the basis that:
 
 
 1. First, in relation to paras1-4 and 6-7 under the heading "Details of Claim" and paras 2-3 in the "Claim for Interlocutory Relief": 
 

&#8226; the proceedings are identical to those previously before Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 , are attempt to re-litigate matters already determined by his Honour, and as such constitute an abuse of process; and
 
&#8226; in any event, the applicant's application has no reasonable prospects of success and should be dismissed pursuant to s 31A Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). 
 
 2. Second, in relation to para 5 under the heading "Details of Claim" and para 1 in the "Claim for Interlocutory Relief", the applicant does not have an existing counterclaim or set off upon which to set aside the bankruptcy notice and as such this claim should be dismissed. 
 
 Relevant principles 
 Abuse of process  36 Having reviewed the material before me, and read:
 
&#8226; the decision of Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 
 
&#8226; the application filed in QUD525/2005 (which is annexed to the affidavit of Mr Whittle sworn 19 June 2007 in these proceedings) and
 
&#8226; the affidavits (including that of the applicant) filed in support of that application (which are annexed to the affidavit of Mr Whittle sworn 6 September 2007 in these proceedings). it is clear that the facts, matters and circumstances upon which the applicant is relying in the substantive proceedings before me to have the relevant bankruptcy notice set aside - and which relate to a set off or counterclaim for damages for financial loss and psychological or mental damage caused by conduct of the respondents - are exactly the same facts, matters and circumstances which were before Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371. I note that Spender J dismissed the claim of the applicant for damages for economic loss and mental damage as a result of the conduct of the respondents. It is inappropriate to allow the application before me to continue, on the basis that there is a set off or counterclaim for damages for financial loss and psychological or mental damage as a result of the conduct of the respondents, which identical claim has already been dismissed. In this respect, I accept the submission of the respondents that there is, in fact, no setoff or counterclaim as envisaged by ss 40(1)(g) and 41 (7) Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) and the High Court in Ebert 104 CLR at 350. &#8226; The only difference that suggests itself between the concept of no reasonable cause of action being disclosed (O 20 r 2(1)(a)) and no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding (s 31A(2)) is that the latter makes plain that there may be taken into account the unavailability of evidence necessary to bring success at trial, whereas it is arguable that the former does not permit the unavailability of such evidence to be taken into account (at [51]). &#8226; It appears that the legislature's intention in enacting s 31A was to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment (including summary dismissal) below the level that had been fixed by such authorities as Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-92, and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129-130 (at [54]). (To that extent the test in s 31A appears less stringent than that in O 20 r 2: Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd (2007) FCA 1371 at [55] ). &#8226; The "no reasonable prospects of success" formula of s 31A reflects the approach adopted in r 24.2 of the United Kingdom's Civil Procedure Rules (at [53]). In the United Kingdom it has been held in the context of that equivalent rule that the expressions "no real prospect of succeeding" and "no real prospect of successfully defending" require attention to be given to real, as opposed to "fanciful" or "merely arguable" prospects (at [59]). 36 Having reviewed the material before me, and read:
 
&#8226; the decision of Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 
 
&#8226; the application filed in QUD525/2005 (which is annexed to the affidavit of Mr Whittle sworn 19 June 2007 in these proceedings) and
 
&#8226; the affidavits (including that of the applicant) filed in support of that application (which are annexed to the affidavit of Mr Whittle sworn 6 September 2007 in these proceedings). it is clear that the facts, matters and circumstances upon which the applicant is relying in the substantive proceedings before me to have the relevant bankruptcy notice set aside - and which relate to a set off or counterclaim for damages for financial loss and psychological or mental damage caused by conduct of the respondents - are exactly the same facts, matters and circumstances which were before Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371. I note that Spender J dismissed the claim of the applicant for damages for economic loss and mental damage as a result of the conduct of the respondents. It is inappropriate to allow the application before me to continue, on the basis that there is a set off or counterclaim for damages for financial loss and psychological or mental damage as a result of the conduct of the respondents, which identical claim has already been dismissed. In this respect, I accept the submission of the respondents that there is, in fact, no setoff or counterclaim as envisaged by ss 40(1)(g) and 41 (7) Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) and the High Court in Ebert 104 CLR at 350. 34 Mr Handran submitted further that the facts, matters and circumstances which the applicant relies on in support of the counterclaim or set off, are the same facts, matters and circumstances which were before Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 and which have been dismissed by his Honour. Mr Handran submits that this is also evident from the supporting affidavit filed by the applicant in support of both her application in this case and that in QUD525/2005.</sentence>
