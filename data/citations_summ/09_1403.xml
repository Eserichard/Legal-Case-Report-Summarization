<citphrase id="cp9.15" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">migration act 1958 (cth), ss 6 , 6a. in an application for review of a decision of the minister for immigration and ethnic affairs made in 1984 refusing an application for a permanent entry permit to an applicant who was the spouse of a permanent resident on the basis that the applicant's marriage had been assessed as being one where the parties did not genuinely intend to continue living as a married couple in australia, it being the minister's policy to refuse permanent entry permits in such cases.  held: (1) that relevant considerations which should have been taken into account were not, thus making the minister's decision invalid pursuant to s 5(2)(b) of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (the act), such considerations being:  (i) a report made in 1981 by an interviewing officer in suva expressing an opinion that the marriage relationship was genuine, such report being part of the history of the relationship, all of which was relevant in determining the quality of the marriage as at the date of the minister deciding the application. although the report was not presented to the minister, it was on the departmental file and was accordingly to be regarded as being constructively before him.  peko-wallsend ltd v. minister for aboriginal affairs (1985) 59 alr 51 , referred to.  (ii) statutory declarations of neighbours and acquaintances as to the applicant leading a normal married life and a letter of a social worker as to the applicant's wife living at home with the applicant, such documents being available to the minister, but there being nothing to indicate that he had taken any account of them.  (2) that in determining whether an administrative decision made under statutory authority falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp9.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<citances>
<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 160">It was contended that there was no decision that directly or indirectly doubted the validity of Le (although see SZHUH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1893 and SZNBX and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2009) 112 ALD 475 ; [2009] FCA 1403). It was submitted that this court was bound by Le " in the aspect of establishing a duty " on a decision-maker to make " reasonable enquiries ", in this case into the validity of issuing a s.20 notice. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1269">The Court is satisfied that the Tribunal had regard to the above documents but rejected them on the basis that the information they contained was not true. As stated above, the Tribunal noted that independent country information indicated that many official documents emanating from China were forgeries. Furthermore the Tribunal was satisfied that no protest had been staged in the appellant's home village in October 2007 and did not accept the appellant's claims in relation to such protest. Accordingly the Tribunal rejected supporting documentation which attested to the truth of such claims. Further, the Tribunal had no duty to make further inquiries in respect of such documentation: see generally Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI and Another [2009] HCA 39 ; (2009) 111 ALD 15 ; SZNBX and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2009] FCA 1403 ; (2009) 112 ALD 475. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 904">Finally, the applicant complained that the Tribunal had rejected documentation without putting it to the test of the document authentication processes that were available to it through the Department. This is a complaint about a failure of the Tribunal to conduct its own inquiries. The High Court has accepted in Minister for Immigration v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 ; (2009) 259 ALR 429 that in certain circumstances a failure to make an inquiry that is an obvious matter concerning a critical factor, the existence of which is easily ascertained, and which could supply a sufficient link to the outcome might constitute a jurisdictional error. But those circumstances are severely limited. The views of the High Court in SZIAI (supra) were reviewed by the Full Bench of the Federal Court in Minister for Immigration v Dhanoa [2009] FCAFC 153 ; (2009) 180 FCR 510 at [46-51] per Jagot and Foster JJ, and SZNBX v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 1403 at [30] per Bennett J, and again by Bennett J in SZMJM v Minister for Immigration [2010] FCA 309 , in particular at [30]-[32], where at [32] her Honour said: "The Tribunal has no general duty proactively to gather opinions, assessments and evaluations in weighing material that an applicant has chosen to put before it. The Tribunal is under no obligation to inquire or seek information not presently available or not put before it by an applicant. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1100">In SZMJM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 309 Bennett J said at [30]: 
 
 SZIAI stated that a failure to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact, the existence of which is easily ascertained, could amount to a failure to review. A Tribunal's failure to inquire may ground a finding of jurisdictional error because the failure renders the ensuing decision manifestly unreasonable, but such circumstances are rare and exceptional ( Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [60] per Kenny J at [60]). The critical underlying question remains whether the decision is vitiated by jurisdictional error. The failure to inquire must constitute a failure to undertake the statutory duty of review or otherwise be so unreasonable as to support a finding that the Tribunal's decision was infected by jurisdictional error ( SZIAI at [26]; see also Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Dhanoa [2009] FCAFC 153 ; (2009) 180 FCR 510 at [46] ---[51] per Jagot and Foster JJ and SZNBX v Minister of Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1403 at [30] per Bennett J). The fact that it may have been reasonable for the Tribunal to make a certain inquiry does not elevate the lack of such an inquiry into a jurisdictional error. 
 
  Bennett J in SZNBX and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2009] FCA 1403 ; (2009) 112 ALD 475 at [21] summarised the principles for consideration following SZIAI . The principles as outlined by Bennett J in SZNBX are as follows: whether the inquiry that the Tribunal failed to make was an obvious inquiry; whether it concerned a critical fact the existence of which was easily ascertained; and whether it supplied a sufficient link to the outcome to constitute a failure to review. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 412">A Tribunal's failure to inquire may ground a finding of jurisdictional error because the failure renders the ensuing decision manifestly unreasonable, but such circumstances are rare and exceptional (Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [60] per Kenny J at [60]). The critical underlying question remains whether the decision is vitiated by jurisdictional error. The failure to inquire must constitute a failure to undertake the statutory duty of review or otherwise be so unreasonable as to support a finding that the Tribunal's decision was infected by jurisdictional error (SZIAI at [26]; see also Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Dhanoa [2009] FCAFC 153 ; (2009) 180 FCR 510 at [46] ---[51] per Jagot and Foster JJ and SZNBX v Minister of Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1403 at [30] per Bennett J). The fact that it may have been reasonable for the Tribunal to make a certain inquiry does not elevate the lack of such an inquiry into a jurisdictional error. [31] In SZIAI at [25] the High Court described the failure on the part of the Tribunal that could, in some circumstances, give rise to jurisdictional error by a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 382">The High Court's decision was presaged by the earlier decision of the Federal Court in Minister for Immigration v Le [2007] FCA 1318 at [60] - [63]. It is clear from both decisions that the Tribunal is under no general duty to make inquiries but that in particular circumstances a failure to make an obvious inquiry on a critical issue where information is likely to readily available may be unreasonable or otherwise involve a failure of the review process. The decision in SZIAI was further considered by the Federal Court in SZMJM v Minister for Immigration [2010] FCA 309 where Bennett J said at [30]: SZIAI stated that a failure to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact, the existence of which is easily ascertained, could amount to a failure to review. A Tribunal's failure to inquire may ground a finding of jurisdictional error because the failure renders the ensuing decision manifestly unreasonable, but such circumstances are rare and exceptional ( Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [60] per Kenny J at [60]). The critical underlying question remains whether the decision is vitiated by jurisdictional error.
