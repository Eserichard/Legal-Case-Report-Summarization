<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 748">After I had completed the above reasons the appellants and the trustees both filed unsolicited further submissions. In their submissions the appellants drew my attention to Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Albarran [2008] FCA 147 ; (2008) 169 FCR 448 in support of the proposition that it is not a defence to a contempt charge that the person charged acted on the advice of solicitors. In their submission the trustees relied on two authorities for the proposition that an ambiguity in an order renders the order incapable of founding a contempt charge: Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 and Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Networks Ltd [2006] FCAFC 41 ; (2006) 150 FCR 110. </sentence>
