<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 36">Although both s.170VV and s.170WG(1) have been repealed with the commencement of the Work Choices Act, reg.2.14, to be found in Chapter 7 of the current Workplace Relations Regulations with the heading " Transition and Other Provisions for the Work Choices Act " provides that a Workplace Inspector can take legal proceedings in relation to any alleged breach of a matter under the old Act despite the amendments that were brought about by the Work Choices Act. I am satisfied that these proceedings are properly brought by the applicant. (see Raymond Murray Smith ( Office of Workplace Ombudsman) v ZiniFex Australia Limited &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 532). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1836">28 Zinifex became aware of these proceedings when it was served with the application and statement of claim in December 2007. It sought a determination that the applicant was not empowered to bring the current proceedings. I decided that objection adversely to Zinifex: Smith v Zinifex Australia Ltd [2008] FCA 532. After that decision was handed down Zinifex co-operated with the enforcement authority and has agreed to these facts without the need for a trial. Although the Zinifex objection failed, it was clearly arguable and not an exercise in delay or obstruction.
