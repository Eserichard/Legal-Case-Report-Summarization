<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 1016">The issue that arises is whether such an error demonstrates jurisdictional error in the manner considered by Greenwood J in SZIFI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 63 , for example, on the basis that it indicates a failure by the Tribunal to consider the applicant's claims, a misunderstanding of the applicant's claims, or a failure or constructive failure to carry out the review ( SZIFI at [33]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1470">In a footnote (p 275, fn 606) in this part of their work the learned authors of Judicial Review of Administrative Action instance SZIFI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 63 ; (2007) 238 ALR 611 ( SZIFI ) as a case which, even though Dranichnikov is not mentioned, offers a good example of the type of procedural fairness error for which they contend Dranichnikov stands. In SZIFI Greenwood J observed (at 614, [43]): 
 
 [43] Once it is established that the tribunal has asked itself the wrong question by, for example, asking whether it can be satisfied that the appellant faces a real chance of persecution should he return to the People's Republic of China, or has identified the wrong issue, or taken into account, in one part of its deliberations, a notion that the appellant is an Indonesian rather than a Pakistani national, the tribunal is seen to have failed to provide the appellant with procedural fairness and thus jurisdictional error arises ( Refugee Review Tribunal and Another; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [59] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ). The repository of the power is constrained by an obligation to act reasonably by providing procedural fairness. A decision made in light of a failure to act reasonably is not a decision made under the Act for the purposes of s 474. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1196">This is not a case in which " the deliberative process going to the merits of the Appellant's case was infused with notions which are erroneous and thus irrelevant to the Appellant's case and suggest that the Tribunal member may have had in mind facts, circumstances and considerations referable to other cases" (see SZIFI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2007) 238 ALR 611 ; [2007] FCA 63 at [33] ) per Greenwood J). Nor is it a case in which it can be said that the erroneous reference to the " Indian" context instead of the " Nepalese" context affected the exercise of power (cf SZIFI at [45] and see SZHFC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1359 at [31] --- 42] per Allsop J). This ground is not made out. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 341">It is apparent having regard to the transcript of the Tribunal hearing, that some of the references to Mr Karimov in this summary of the oral evidence at the hearing are typographical errors and should refer to Mr Kurbanov. It is clear from the whole of the Tribunal decision, in particular the findings and reasons part of the decision, that the Tribunal understood that this oral evidence related to the applicant's claimed meeting with Mr Kurbanov (transcript pp.16 --- 19). The applicant did not raise any issue about the incorrect references to Mr Karimov. Having regard to the Tribunal decision as a whole it is not apparent that such typographical errors affected the exercise of power by the Tribunal (cf SZIFI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 63 ; (2007) 238 ALR 611 at [45] per Greenwood J. As in SZJRW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 959 the Tribunal comprehensively examined all the underlying facts going to the applicant's claims (at [68] per Greenwood J and see SZMAD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1275 and " CCC" v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 682). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 23">Considerable reliance was placed by counsel for the applicant upon the decision of Greenwood J in the Federal Court of SZIFI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 63. There the Tribunal, in evaluating a claim for a protection visa based upon fears of persecution alleged by the applicant who was a national of Pakistan if he was to return to Pakistan, made two fundamentally erroneous statements in its Findings and Reasons. The first was that the applicant had claimed to be a national of Indonesia and the second was that he was fearful of a real chance of persecution should he return to the People's Republic of China ("PRC"). Not only was he not an Indonesian national, he of course did not hold any fears or any intentions in respect of a return to the PRC. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 452">Ms Clegg makes the following submissions in respect of this ground of review: The information in question (Nigerian instead of Liberian) was not information which was ultimately relied upon by the Tribunal. Consequently, it did not form part of the reasons for affirming the decision under review so the s.424A obligation was not invoked in respect of that information. If s.424A(1) was invoked there was no breach because although there was a typographic error this does not amount to jurisdictional error; SZIFI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 63 per Greenwood J at [42]-[45]; SHMW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 321 per Scarlett FM at [20]. It could only lead to a jurisdictional error if it could be reasonably suggested that the error in some way confused the applicant so that he did not understand why the information was relevant to the review, such that it did not comply with s.424A(1)(b). The applicant has not suggested that he did not understand why the information was relevant to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision. It is submitted that that conclusion is not surprising because in this case it is clear from the applicant's coherent and direct response to the Tribunal's invitation to comment on information that he did well understand the very issue that the Tribunal sought to raise notwithstanding the typographic error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 247">This is a matter, of course, that has been the cause of some discussion in the Court's on previous occasions. In SZIFI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [5] , his Honour Greenwood J dealt with a case where the Tribunal had, in fact, made not one error about the applicant's nationality but, indeed, two. That error was of such magnitude, a finding that the appellant did not have a well founded fear of persecution upon return to Peoples Republic of China where he was a national of Pakistan, constituted an error going to jurisdiction. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FMCA 1944">I brought to the attention of counsel for the first respondent the decision of Greenwood J in SZIFI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 63 and gave the parties an opportunity to make further written submissions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FMCA 1850">23. The tribunal referred to the hearing invitation dated 28 June 2006 and an oral request by the adviser on that day for a postponement of a hearing on the basis that the applicant did not live near Sydney. It observed that the request was not put in writing until 12 July "2005". This date is clearly wrong, however while in some circumstances a factual error in a tribunal decision can constitute jurisdictional error if it indicates a failure to have regard to the circumstances of the applicant's case (see e.g. SZIFI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 63) , in all the circumstances of this case, having regard to the dates on which the applicant arrived in Australia, made her application and review application and the dates of the hearing invitation and subsequent events, I consider that the reference to 2005 rather than 2006 is no more than a typographical error, that the tribunal understood that the applicant's adviser's written request followed the hearing invitation of 28 June 2006 and that in considering whether there was in fact time for the applicant to arrange to attend a hearing notwithstanding the applicant's temporary residence in Wentworth, the tribunal had regard to the time available to her from its rejection of the request for a postponement on 13 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FMCA 1560">The first respondent submits that the Court should infer that the RRT intended to refer to the UPA as it does so in the country information which is relevant to the applicant's case, which same country information is expressed in language which is almost identical to that which is used in connection with the reference to the UNP. The typographical error does not create a manifestly absurd result and should not be used as a basis to overturn the decision. See: S14/2002 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCAFC 171 ;Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297 but cf SZIFI v MIMIA [2007] FCA 63. 
 Ground (e) 
 33. The applicant complains that the RRT said his evidence was 'vague' but did not ask more questions to clear up the applicant's doubtful answers.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FMCA 829">The applicant referred to the case of SZIFI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 63 ; (2007) 94 ALD 298 where Greenwood J considered a case in which the Tribunal described a national of Pakistan as a national of Indonesia and went on to consider whether he faced a real chance of persecution should he return to the People's Republic of China.</sentence>
