 This appeal from the making of a sequestration order by Raphael FM ( Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd v Sood (No 2) [2006] FMCA 265) concerns the interplay between the bankruptcy legislation and the Federal proceeds of crime legislation, as did an earlier interlocutory issue ( Sood v Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 715). The main question in the appeal is whether an order pursuant to s 18 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) effectively stays execution on an outstanding judgment against the party subject to that order for the purposes of s 40(1)(g) and s 41(3)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). There is also an issue as to whether the learned Federal Magistrate was in error in making a sequestration order in any event. The facts as to the main question are in a short compass. </sentence>
