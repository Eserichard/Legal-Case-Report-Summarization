<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1302">As a result of a series of interlocutory proceedings, the Applicant's application and statement of claim have been amended on a number of occasions: see Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2008) 251 ALR 166 ; Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Limited (No 5) [2009] FCA 1464 and on appeal [2010] FCAFC 129. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 877">Nevertheless, a wholly inadequate pleading of an effects case cannot be made good by filing and serving statements with an implicit invitation to the respondents to distil the material facts demonstrating the relevant statutory effect or likely effect. Plainly, the material facts must be pleaded and the facts said to establish the cause of action must not be pleaded at too great a level of generality or at too high a level of abstraction ( HECEC Australia Pty Ltd v Hydro, Electric Corp [1999] FCA 822 ; State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 499 ; [1999] ATPR 41-691 at 42, 828-9; Charlie Carter Pty Ltd v The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association (WA) (1987) 13 FCR 413 ; and Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall (Australia) Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 557). The authorities governing the exercise of the discretion to strike out a pleading are usefully assembled by Weinberg J in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1101 ; (1999) 165 ALR 409 at 415-421; adopted by Tracey J in Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 and applied in Australian Automotive Repairers' Association (Political Action Committee) Inc v NRMA Insurance Ltd [2002] FCA 1568 at [14] - [17] ; Australian Wool Innovation Ltd v Newkirk [2005] FCA 290 ; [2005] ATPR 42-053 at 42, 669 - 42,670. It is not necessary to restate those well understood principles. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 96">6 In the proceeding before the primary Judge, the applicant, Auskay International Manufacturing and Trade Pty Ltd, alleged that the respondents, seven international airlines (two of which were sued by way of two companies, making nine respondents in all) had made, and given effect to, agreements, arrangements or understandings to fix, control or maintain the price of international airfreight services, contrary to s 45(2)(a)(ii) , and (b)(ii), of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). By a judgment given on 29 September 2008, an earlier iteration of the Statement of Claim had been struck out under O 11 r 16 on account (amongst other things) of its failure to identify the market in which the respondents were alleged to be in competition with other: Auskay International Manufacturing and Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2008) 251 ALR 166. After that judgement, the applicant made substantial modifications to its pleading, the result of which was that the Fourth Amended Statement of Claim made copious provision on the question of the relevant market or markets. Notwithstanding those amendments, the primary Judge took the view that the pleading was deficient in failing to allege the facts necessary to sustain the conclusion that there was a relevant market in Australia, as required by s 4E of the Trade Practices Act . This conclusion was significant in his Honour's ultimate decision to strike out the applicant's pleading, and it is, therefore, convenient to commence with a consideration of how the pleading dealt with the subject of market. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCAFC 85">59 We do not understand the primary Judge to have resisted the proposition that a market in Australia may exist as part of a global market. In the extract from Riverstone which we have set out above, his Honour emphasised the word "arguably", and, a little later in his reasons, continued (at [37]):
 In a case such as the present where an applicant alleges the existence of a global market or a market extending beyond the bounds of Australia (but which includes Australia), it is necessary that that market be identified in any pleading. It is a material fact or particular: see Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2008) 251 ALR 166 at 173. The pleadings must identify the relevant goods or services, the geographic boundaries of the market and those involved in close competition within the market whom it is said have engaged in anti-competitive conduct. A single market will thus be identified, which will include a "market in Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 510">On 29 September 2008 Tracey J, in the proceeding, ordered that the second amended statement of claim filed on 21 September 2007 be struck out and that Auskay be given leave to file and serve a further statement of claim on or before 31 October 2008: Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2008) 251 ALR 166.  Essentially, the effect of these submissions was summarised in the Treasury Executive Minute referred to in the next paragraph.

Order 73 r 3 further provides that a representative proceeding " must be commenced by filing an application in accordance with Form 129 ". That form is framed by reference to s 33H(1)(a), (b) and (c): Bailey v Veda Advantage Information Services and Solutions Ltd [2007] FCA 1664 at [9] . Amongst the other requirements imposed by s 33H, s 33H(1)(a) requires the " group members " to be clearly identified: Auskay International Manufacturing and Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 at [27] , [2008] FCA 1458 ; 251 ALR 166 at 175 per Tracey J. In an attempt to give some greater clarification as to that which is required by s 33H(1)(a), Sackville J in Petrusevski v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Ltd [2003] FCA 61 observed:
 
 
 [19] In determining what s 33H(1)(a) of the Federal Court Act requires, it is important to consider why it is necessary to describe or identify the group members in a representative proceeding. One reason, as the High Court observed in Wong v Silkfield , is to enable the Court to determine whether the requirements of s 33C have been satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] VSCA 44">21 The power to stay, or summarily dismiss a claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action must be exercised with caution, and only in the clearest of cases. [10] If it appears that there is a real question to be tried, whether of fact or law, and the rights of the parties depend upon the answer to that question, it is not competent for the Court to dismiss an action as frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process.

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCA 1317">In a case such as the present where an applicant alleges the existence of a global market or a market extending beyond the bounds of Australia (but which includes Australia), it is necessary that that market be identified in any pleading. It is a material fact or particular: see Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2008) 251 ALR 166 at 173. The pleadings must identify the relevant goods or services, the geographic boundaries of the market and those involved in close competition within the market whom it is said have engaged in anti-competitive conduct. A single market will thus be identified, which will include a "market in Australia". </sentence>

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCAFC 136">31 In doing so, his Honour referred to a number of decision of single judges of the Court in which the notion of a "market in Australia" had been considered: Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd (ACN 002 311 462) v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited (ACN 002 955 571) [2002] FCA 1608 (Hill J); Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd (ACN 078 654 243) v Qantas Airways Ltd (ACN 009 661 901) [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2008) 251 ALR 166 (Tracey J); Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd (ACN 009 661 901) [2008] FCA 1976 ; (2008) 253 ALR 89 (Lindgren J). 70 It is unnecessary to refer in any detail to the decisions of single judges of this Court in which the concept of a global market for air cargo services has been considered: see Riverstone [2002] FCA 1608 , Auskay [2008] FCA 1458 ; 251 ALR 166 and Qantas [2008] FCA 1976 ; 253 ALR 89 ; see also ACCC v Singapore Airlines [2009] FCA 510 ; 256 ALR 458 at [76] ff. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCA 510">It is true that the authorities, including three recent cases that have considered the question in relation to international air freight services, accept the proposition (either expressly or impliedly) that a global market is capable of constituting a market in Australia: Riverstone Computer Services Pty Limited v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] , Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2009) 251 ALR 166 at [21] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1976 ; (2009) 253 ALR 89 at [35] ; Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 at [70] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FCA 312">The notion of a 'market in Australia' was recently referred to by Lindgren J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1976 , where his Honour stated (at [33]-[34]): 
 Although the notion of a "market in Australia" in s 4E has been referred to in two cases ( Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] per Hill J and Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2008) ATPR 42-256 at [19] per Tracey J), the concept has not been the subject of extensive judicial consideration. 

 
 In Riverstone , Hill J rejected the proposition that in order to be a "market in Australia" a market must be wholly within Australia. His Honour said (at [21]) that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products. As the Commission points out, a contrary view would considerably reduce the efficacy and utility of the competition law provisions of the Act, especially in the modern telecommunications era. 
  A preliminary attack was made on the use of the concept of point of origin or destination of a service as a reference point able to be used in the Notices. It was contended that the Notices (even if confined to outbound services) did not sufficiently describe a matter involving a contravention of the Act, particularly in failing to describe the market in Australia. I accept that just because services cover the movement of goods in or out of Australia, does not necessarily indicate that there is a relevant market located in Australia in respect of those services: see Auskay International Marketing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 at [19] and [21] per Tracey J. However, as I mention later, the Notices when properly construed adequately describe matters capable of involving a contravention of the Act and by reference to a market in Australia. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FCA 1976">Although the notion of a "market in Australia" in s 4E has been referred to in two cases ( Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] per Hill J and Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2008) ATPR 42-256 at [19] per Tracey J), the concept has not been the subject of extensive judicial consideration. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FCA 1623">2 However, where a demonstrated failure to plead material facts gives rise to no real confusion or gives rise to no issue of substantive principle, the Court will be restrained in the exercise of the strike-out power. Not all conclusionary pleadings will be struck out. Whether a pleading ought to be struck out will depend upon whether the facts have been pleaded at too great a level of generality or at too high a level of abstraction ( HECEC Australia Pty Ltd v Hydro-Electric Corp [1999] FCA 822 ; State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 499 ; [1999] ATPR 41-691 at 42, 828-9; Charlie Carter Pty Ltd v The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association (WA) (1987) 13 FCR 413 ; and Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall (Australia) Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 557). The authorities governing the exercise of the discretion to strike out a pleading are usefully assembled by Weinberg J in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1101 ; (1999) 165 ALR 409 at 415-421; adopted by Tracey J in Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; and as Tracey J notes, applied in Australian Automotive Repairers' Association (Political Action Committee) Inc. v NRMA Insurance Ltd [2002] FCA 1568 at [14] - [17]; Australian Wool Innovation Ltd v Newkirk [2005] FCA 290 ; [2005] ATPR 42-053 at 42, 669-42, 670. It is not necessary to restate comprehensively the content of those well understood principles. </sentence>
