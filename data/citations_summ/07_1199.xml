<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 370">I accept the summary provided by Counsel for the First Respondent in her written submissions of decisions of the Federal Court of Australia where SZHFE has been considered and followed: "SZHFE has been considered by the Federal Court in SZIMY v. Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 249 at [11] (Tribunal's reliance upon negligible interest in Falun Gong since arriving in Australia did not engage section 91R(3)) , SZHTC v. Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1199 at [25] (Tribunal's reliance on applicant's failure to resume his alleged practise of Falun Gong in Australia did not engage section 91R(3)) , and SZGDJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 722 at [17] - [22] (Tribunal's reliance upon applicant's lack of involvement with activities of the Awami League in Australia in reaching credibility findings did not engage section 91R(3)). It was also recently followed by Barnes FM in SZMJD v. Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1297. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 64">On 10 September 2008, the applicant filed in this Court an amended application for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision. He gave three grounds. The first: 
"The Tribunal failed to consider the fact that I have been practising Falun Gong in Australia, and my activities here may cause further persecution to me on my return to China. "
 
Although, Ms Weston, in her helpful written submissions has addressed this matter, on the basis of the authorities: SZHFE v The Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FCA 648 and SZHTC v The Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 1199 , in my view, this was not necessary because I am quite satisfied from the extracts that I have cited in this decision that the applicant did not tell the Tribunal that he had been practising Falun Gong in Australia. He may have practised Falun Gong in Australia but the Tribunal's job is to consider the evidence that was before it and not things that the applicant may have known but did not tell it. In case I am wrong about this, I am fully satisfied that the views expressed by Ms Weston in paras.15.1 and 15.2 of her written submissions are correct. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1316">I consider that this is not a case where s.91R(3) of the Act has been enlivened. I accept the submission by the first respondent that s.91R(3) is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. As relevantly observed by Jacobson J in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] - [31] : The effect of the submission is that section 91R(3) is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well founded fear of persecution. In my opinion, this is plainly the effect of section 91R(3) and the subsection is not enlivened in the present case. Accordingly, in my view it is clear that there was no error in the RRT having regard to that conduct in making the findings which it did. This is particularly so in the present case where the appellant did not rely on his conduct in Australia to support his claim for refugee status 
 (and see SZHFE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA Trans 10 at 2 per Kirby J ; SZGDJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 722 at [17] - [22] per Weinberg J ; SZIMY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 249 at [11] per Conti J ; and SZHTC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1199 at [25] per Gilmour J). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 722">17 There are many difficulties with that submission. In the first place, it flies directly in the face of SZHFE, a case which has at least twice been considered and followed in this Court: see SZIMY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 249 at [11] and SZHTC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1199 at [25] . SZHFE was the subject of an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court. That application was dismissed by Kirby and Callinan JJ, who expressly stated that they agreed with the analysis of Jacobson J. </sentence>
