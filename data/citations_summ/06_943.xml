<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 244">The role of courts confronted with unrepresented litigants has received repeated but sometimes possibly conflicting responses. In Neil v Nott [1994] HCA 23 , 121 ALR 148 at 150, for example, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ observed: 
 
 A frequent consequence of self-representation is that the court must assume the burden of endeavouring to ascertain the rights of parties which are obfuscated by their own advocacy. 
 

 
See also: Nipperess v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2006] FCA 943 at [51] , [2006] FCA 943 ; 43 AAR 252 at 262. But it has also been said that a " court should be astute to see that it does not extend its auxiliary role so as to confer upon a litigant in person a positive advantage over the represented opponent ": Vaeula v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (" Vaeula ") [2004] FCAFC 147 at [59] (applying Rajski v Scitec Corp Pty Ltd (Unreported, NSWCA, Kirby, Samuels and Mahoney JJA, 16 June 1986). As Beaumont, Conti and Crennan JJ there observed, " it is difficult to generalise in this area where unrepresented parties appear ": Vaeula , supra at [58].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1609">15 Although an unrepresented applicant is relevantly in no different position, both courts and tribunals are conscious of the difficulties confronting unrepresented litigants and are conscious of ensuring that any hearing is fair and just: Rogers v Law Coast Mortgages Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 181 at [26] per Finn J. See also: Neil v Nott [1994] HCA 23 ; (1994) 68 ALJR 509. Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ there observed:

56 This passage was adopted by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 85 ; (1999) 84 FCR 438 at 446 [28] . The Court noted, however, at 445 [27], that the duty of a trial judge might be more extensive in criminal proceedings, as compared to civil proceedings: see also Nipperess v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2006] FCA 943 ; (2006) 91 ALD 362. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] NSWIRComm 271">The Court (Sackville, North and Kenny JJ) affirmed principles stated by Samuels JA (at 14) in this Court in Rajski v Scitec Corporation Pty Ltd (Court of Appeal, 16 June 1986, unreported) to the following effect: 
 
 
 
 
 
 

"In my view, the advice and assistance which a litigant in person ought to receive from the court should be limited to that which is necessary to diminish, so far as this is possible, the disadvantage which he or she will ordinarily suffer when faced by a lawyer, and to prevent destruction from the traps which our adversary procedure offers to the unwary and untutored ... An unrepresented party is as much subject to the rules as any other litigant. The court must be patient in explaining them and may be lenient in the standard of compliance which it exacts. "
 
 
 
 
 These principles were recently applied in Nipperess v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2006] FCA 943 at [50] - [54] by Cowdroy J. 155 The passage from the transcript extracted above failed to provide an explanation to the appellant of the problems with the evidence he sought to tender and the means that might be available for rectification of the problems. The objection by counsel and the response of the trial judge reflected obscurantism rather than elucidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] NSWCA 31">
 

154 In Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 85 ; (1999) 84 FCR 438 at [29] , the Full Court of the Federal Court considered the duty of a trial judge to an unrepresented litigant and suggested that the duty might have a more extensive scope in criminal proceedings than in civil proceedings. The Court (Sackville, North and Kenny JJ) affirmed principles stated by Samuels JA (at 14) in this Court in Rajski v Scitec Corporation Pty Ltd (Court of Appeal, 16 June 1986, unreported) to the following effect:
