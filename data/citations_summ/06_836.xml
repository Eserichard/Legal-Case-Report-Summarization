<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1060">In commenting upon this rule, and the central role it serves in ensuring particular documents are available for public inspection, Rares J in Llewellyn v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 836 , 154 FCR 293 (" Llewellyn ") observed: 
 
 [22] Significantly, the rules of the Supreme Court of New South Wales are not the same as those in O 46, r 6. That Court had a rule in Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW), Pt 65 , r 7, which provided that: 
 

 
 
 
 A person may not search in a registry for or inspect any document or thing in the proceedings without the leave of the Court. 
 
 

 
 
 [23] This Court has clearly taken a very different approach in its rule and has not left it to the parties to keep confidential that which has at least been relied on as the process by which proceedings in this Court are initiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 118"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 115">10 The public is well able to distinguish the fact that there is an allegation that is untested as against one that is established by a judgment or verdict. That is the fundamental basis on which our system of open justice law has proceeded for centuries. The exercise of the judicial power under Ch III of the Constitution ordinarily must occur in open Court. I held in Llewellyn v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 836 ; (2006) 154 FCR 293 at 297-299 [18] - [28] that it is not appropriate to suppress allegations, merely because they are untested even if they are of the most serious kind or salacious. The power to make, or continue, an order under s 50 cannot be exercised merely because it appears to be convenient, reasonable or sensible, or to serve some notion of the public interest or as a result of a balancing exercise: Hogan 267 ALR at 19 [31]. The sole issue is whether or not it is necessary in the interests of justice that something be suppressed from publicity. That is an extraordinary course. It requires justification. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] NSWSC 781">


 
29 With all due respect to the eminence and standing of those two very well respected and experienced judges, I disagree with their observations. In that regard I agree with Rares J who observed in Llewellyn v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 836 as follows:
 
 
 
 "In my view the approach taken by Santow J and Barrett J is fundamentally erroneous. It misunderstands the function of fair reports of proceedings and the availability to all persons of the right to be able to make fair reports of proceedings that have been initiated in courts. Ordinary members of the public are well aware of the difference between allegations made in courts and findings made by courts. People who make allegations or cause the processes of courts to be invoked do so in the circumstance that they are asking for the judicial power of the state... to be applied to the resolution of their dispute" 
 


 
 
 [cf the observations of Gleeson CJ, Gummow Hahne and Heyden in D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid [2005] 79 ALJR at 755 [31]-[33] observing inter alia as follows: "No doubt the immediate parties to a controversy are very interested in the way in which it is resolved. But the community at large has a vital interest in the final quelling of that controversy".

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCAFC 71">125 Rares J considered the matter of untested allegations in Llewellyn v Nine Network Australia [2006] FCA 836 ; (2006) 154 FCR 293 , where at [28] he said: 
 I am of opinion that a similar principle is well known to members of the community in respect of civil litigation. The proposition that untested allegations in civil proceedings are somehow to be shielded from public view merely because they are untested allegations and could only possibly be properly understood in the context of a fully contested hearing is, in my opinion, not one that can sit with the principle of open justice or the right of anyone fairly to report proceedings in a court of justice. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] FCA 1306">Rares J in Llewellyn v Nine Network Australia Pty Limited [2006] FCA 836 took the view that Santow J and Barrett J in two cases in the Supreme Court had adopted an incorrect approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] FCA 1168">I do not consider that the first reason provides a basis for excluding documents under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Given the principle of open justice, the fact that documents have not been admitted into evidence would not be sufficient to justify a prohibition on their publication. In Llewellyn v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 836 Rares J observed at [27]: 
 
 'The proposition that untested allegations in civil proceedings are somehow to be shielded from public view merely because they are untested allegations and could only possibly be properly understood in the context of a fully contested hearing is, in my opinion, not one that can sit with the principle of open justice or the right of anyone fairly to report proceedings in a court of justice.
