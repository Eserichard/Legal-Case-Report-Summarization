<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] NSWSC 579">12 In Re Dana Australia (Holdings) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 355 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 99 , Finkelstein J held that a period specified in the ASIC class order issued under s.341 for the doing of an act specified in the class order was one that came within the words "the period for doing any act, matter or thing ... in relation to a corporation". He reasoned, in effect, that if ASIC has, in exercise of a statutory power, created an alternative regime of regulation applicable to corporations and imposed time limits as part of that regime, the s.1322(4)(d) power is attracted because the alternative regime not only applies to corporations but is sufficiently akin to a statutory regime to warrant treatment in the same way. Finkelstein J distinguished a regime created by class order of general application from one arising from a specific decision of ASIC in relation to a particular case, such as a decision under s.340.</sentence>
