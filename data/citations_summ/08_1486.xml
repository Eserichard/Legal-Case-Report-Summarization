<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 327">The first respondent submits that: the Tribunal was entitled to have regard to the absence of past persecution; the Tribunal considered the absence of past persecution in conjunction with all other relevant considerations; in: Applicant NABD of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [66] it was noted that: In many, perhaps most cases, the primary basis for what is said to be a well-founded fear of future persecution is an account of past persecution, usually given as the reason for leaving a country of nationality. [67] SZNDJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [68] the Court held: Insofar as it is contended that the Tribunal had to analyse the future harm the applicant may face, in circumstances where the Tribunal did not accept the credibility of any of the applicant's claims about past harm which he claimed gave rise to a well-founded fear of persecution, it was not necessary for it to go on to analyse in any more detail than it did the possibility of future harm. [69] SBZF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [70] the Federal Court held: It is, of course, relevant in determining whether there is a real chance that an event will occur for a particular reason in the future to consider whether similar events have or have not occurred in the past for the same or similar reasons. It was appropriate, therefore, for the Tribunal to determine whether or not the appellant herself had been subject to persecutory conduct for a Convention reason: Guo 191 CLR 559. However, a finding that she has not previously been subject to persecution for a Convention reason does not necessarily answer the question as to whether there is a real chance that she will be subject to persecutory conduct in the future if she were to return to China for a Convention reason: Appellant S395/2002 216clr473.html" class="autolink_findacts">216 CLR 473 per Gummow and Hayne JJ at 499.</sentence>
