<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VCC 455"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 352">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 682 considered s 53 of the TPA. The requirement that the representation be false or misleading was considered at paragraphs [14] and [15] as follows: 
 
 
 In relation to the first element, s 53(e ) requires the representation to be "false or misleading" as opposed to "misleading or deceptive" (in s 52). I was not taken to, and I have not found, any authority which attributes a meaningful difference to this dichotomy for the purposes of the TPA. (For a discussion of the phrase "false and misleading" under a different Act, see Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Hadkiss (2007) 160 FCR 151). Indeed, the vast majority of cases that discuss an alleged breach of s 53(e) couple it with a breach of s 52 and deal with the "false or misleading" and "misleading or deceptive" aspect of the conduct mutatis mutandis: see Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1613 ; (2005) 214 ALR 554 at [94] ; ACCC v Target Australia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1326 ; (2001) ATPR 41-840 ; ACCC v Harbin Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1792 ; ACCC v Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 199 at [42] . 
 
 

 
 
 
 That is not altogether surprising. The purpose of s 53 has been described as being to "[support] s 52 by enumerating specific types of conduct which, if engaged in by a corporation in trade or commerce in connection with the promotion or supply of goods or services, [would] give rise to a breach of the Act": see R Miller, Miller's Annotated Trade Practices Act (30th ed, 2009), [1.53.5]. Accordingly, and in the absence of any submission to the contrary, I see no reason why the application of s 53(e) should not fall to be determined upon the conclusions I reach in relation to s 52 - namely that the representations were misleading and deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 15">At p.561 of Miller's Annotated Trade Practices Act the learned author sets out a summary of the principles to be applied in relation to claims pursuant to s.52 of the Trade Practices Act extracted from ACCC v Dukemaster Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 682: A contravention of s 52(1) is established by "conduct" which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. "Conduct" can include making a statement which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. The "conduct" must lead, or be capable of leading, a person into error and the error or misconception must result from "conduct" of the corporation and not from other circumstances for which the corporation is not responsible.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FCA 8">The facts of each case must be considered in light of the ordinary incidents and character of commercial behaviour, to determine if a party has engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct; see General Newspapers Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation [1993] FCA 473 ; (1993) 45 FCR 164 at [178] . Conduct is deemed misleading or deceptive if it induces, or is capable of inducing error; see Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 per Brennan J at [198]. The general principles underpinning s 52 have been well established; see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 682 , per Gordon J at [10]. Primus points to conduct that it alleges amounts to misleading and deceptive conduct being: the DigiPlus Purchase Offer made on 19 October 2004; the making of implied representations in communicating the Purchase Offer, that supply of the carriage services would in the relevantly immediate future be available to Kooee on the terms set out in the DigiPlus Purchase Offer and; Kooee not informing Primus that after 19 October 2004 and before 27 April 2005, when the Separation Deed was entered into, that supply on the terms of the Purchase Offer was no longer available to Kooee. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] VSC 476">44 In any event, the cases referred to make it clear that in considering what is unconscionable (and presumably unfair) it is necessary to undertake a careful and thorough analysis of the circumstances and conduct said to be unconscionable. There must be a process of reasoning. [29]  41 The respondents' counsel referred me to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster Pty Ltd, [24] where Gordon J at [17] adopted with approval the reasoning of Foster J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [25] where his Honour notes at [113] that the word "unconscionable" in s 51AC of the TPA is not limited to the meaning of the word according to the established principles of common law and equity and then cites with approval a number of authorities in support of this proposition. The authorities referred to by Foster J (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [26] and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [27] ) make it plain, it was submitted, that the factors listed in ss 51AA, 51AB and 51AC of the TPA do not limit the matters to which a Court may have regard and those matters fall outside specific equitable doctrines. However in my opinion, the cases do not go so far as to permit the Court to simply do anything it considers fair. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] NSWSC 963">86 Enterprises pleads that in August and September 2003 the defendants made representations to Ms Ventouris that (a) a loan of $100,000 to E ---Style would be a safe investment, (b) a loan of $100,000 to E-Style would be repaid together with interest, and (c) the defendants would ensure that the loan of $100,000 to E-Style would be repaid. I find each of these three representations made out. Of course it is the defendant's "conduct" which must be established to be misleading and deceptive before a contravention of Trade Practices Act s 52 or Fair Trading Act s 42 is established: ACCC v Dukemaster Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 682 and Equity Access Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation [1989] FCA 506 ; (1990) ATPR 40-994 . But this case has been pleaded by reference to representations and the case relies on Trade Practices Act s 51A, which does refer to " representations " with respect to future matters. It is convenient therefore to analyse the conduct that the plaintiff relies upon by reference to the pleaded representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 679">There is a helpful summary of the principles to be applied in relation to section 52 to be found in ACCC v Dukemaster Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 682 and those matters are set out at page 561 of Miller's Annotated Trade Practices Act and there are a series of dot points indicating the kinds of matters to which the Court looks to which the Court expects to be established in order for such an application to be made out. As I say, we are not in any doubt about what the claim relates to. It relates to Mr Bourne's responsive letter to Mr Kowalski of 26 April and I have to ask myself, what is the evidence upon which I could act or rely to be satisfied that Mr Bourne has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive? The conduct can include the making of a statement so the fact that it is in a letter does not make any difference. But the conduct must lead or be capable of leading a person into error and the error or misconception must result from the conduct and not from other circumstances for which the respondent is not responsible. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 856">The Court clearly has power to make such an order, under ss 80 and 86C(2) of the TP Act; see eg Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 682. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FMCA 590">In arguendo Ms Rawlings conceded that the damages had to be assessed pursuant to s.82 of the Act and that those damages were compensatory. She conceded that the respondent had not paid the licence fee and so had not lost any money as a result of the unlawful activity of the applicant. The case can be distinguished from ACCC v Dukemaster Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 682 where the leaseholder who had been the victim of unconscionable conduct by the lessor was awarded the difference between the amount that should have been paid and the amount which she actually paid under the lease. That is the appropriate measure of damages and, as there was no loss in this case, I am unable to award any damages for the breach of s.51AC. The two heads of damage found in the submissions of the respondent make a claim similar to that made in Dukemaster (supra) but without the payment having previously been made.</sentence>

Although the circumstances of the conduct in Butcher v Lachlan Realty Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 is quite different, the High Court emphasises at [39] per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ that everything relevant must be taken into account as a whole. The test is whether an ordinary or reasonable person from the class of persons to whom the representation is made is likely to be misled or deceived. The test is an objective one for the Court to determine itself upon the whole of the evidence: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 ; Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at [103] --- [105]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster [2009] FCA 682 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Dreamtime Creations Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1545 ; (2010) 263 ALR 487 per Mansfield J at [14] to [16]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2010] VCAT 411">In the circumstances, I also find that Williams Batters did not engage in misleading or unconscionable conduct when they told Dr Tang that the payment of the fee was a condition of the landlord's consent. That statement did not lead Dr Tang into error or misconception. [7] Dr Tang was obliged to seek the landlord's consent to a transfer of the practice carried on at the premises to Dr Cao and was obliged to pay the landlord's reasonable costs of providing that consent.

<sentence id="cs14" from="[2010] FCA 259">The width of s 51AC is not to be doubted: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 682 at [17] . Gordon J there cited with approval the following observations of Foster J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 , 253 ALR 324: 
 
 [113] There is a body of authority in this Court which establishes the following propositions: 
 

 
 
 (a) The scope of s 51AC is wider than that of s 51AA. The meaning of unconscionable for the purposes of s 51AC is not limited to the meaning of the word according to established principles of common law and equity: per French J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 2 ; (2000) 96 FCR 491 at [24] and [25] (p 503); per Sundberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at [31] (p 265); per Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Limited (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [183] (p 487) and per Jacobson J in Pacific National (ACT) Limited v Queensland Rail (2006) 28 ATPR 46-268 (p 53,515) at [918] (p 53,527).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2010] NSWADTAP 15">57 Alternatively, Mr Spring submitted that the Tribunal should follow the lead given by the Federal Court in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 682. In that case, the Court held that the conduct of a landlord towards a number of 'sitting tenants' was unconscionable under section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act 1975 (Cth) (this being the section on which section 62B of the RL Act is based). It did so on the basis of findings that, having regard to the capacity of the tenants to protect themselves and the relevance of pressures of time imposed on them, the landlord had not engaged in negotiation, but had simply imposed an ultimatum, and that deliberate conduct of this nature was irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2010] FMCA 67">Failure to observe that norm has consequences provided elsewhere in the Act. (See the judgment of the High Court in Master Education Services Pty Ltd v Ketchell [2008] HCA 38 ; (2008) 82 ALJR 1322 at [28] to [32] (pp 1329-1330) and the cases cited in those paragraphs). " 

Foster J's decision in Allphones Retail was considered and adopted at [17] by Gordon J in ACCC v Dukemaster Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 682 (" Dukemaster "). In that case, his Honour made declarations about matters which have some resonance in the instant case.

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] FCA 1022">As set out in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster Pty Ltd (ACN 050 275 226) [2009] FCA 682 at [10] , the principles may be summarised as follows: A contravention of s 52(1) of the TPA is established by "conduct" which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; 2 FCR 82 , 87. The "conduct", in the circumstances, must lead, or be capable of leading, a person into error ( Hannaford (trading as Torrens Valley Orchards) v Australian Farmlink Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1591 at [252] citing Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd [1982] FCA 136 ; (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 200; Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 198) and the error or misconception must result from "conduct" of the corporation and not from other circumstances for which the corporation is not responsible: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; 2 FCR 82 , 91. "Conduct" is likely to mislead or deceive if there is a "real or not remote chance or possibility regardless of whether it is less or more than fifty per cent": Global Sportsman Pty Ltd 2 FCR 82, 87.</sentence>
