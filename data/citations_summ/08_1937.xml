<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 56">This ground must be rejected. As the Federal Magistrate correctly noted, s 427(1)(d) empowers the Tribunal to act but does not impose any obligation to act: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21-22 [43]. This is not one of those rare or exceptional cases in which an obligation to inquire might be said to arise having regard to all the circumstances of the case: compare Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Singh (1997) 74 FCR 553 at 561; SZMDB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1937 ; (2008) 105 ALD 499 at [39] and the authorities there cited; and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 ; (2009) 259 ALR 429 at 436 [25] - [26]. The Tribunal considered that it was not necessary to contact the authors of the letters before concluding that the letters were unreliable. In doing so, the Tribunal did not make a jurisdictional error. Ground 3: Failure to consider Lee J's comments in WAHP, citing Karanakaran
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 945">As was pointed out in SZMPF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 908 with reference to these paragraphs: "9. These observations have been repeatedly approved and applied by subsequent decisions of this Court, e.g. SZMHL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 581 at [18] per Perram J; SZMDB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1937 at [40], [2008] FCA [2008] FCA 1937 ; 1937 ; 105 ALD 499 at 506 per Graham J; MZXCL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1770 at [13] per Buchanan J; Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1700 at [39] per Middleton J; Applicant M31 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 533 at [22] per Weinberg J. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 908">These observations have been repeatedly approved and applied by subsequent decisions of this Court, e.g. SZMHL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 581 at [18] per Perram J; SZMDB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1937 at [40] , [2008] FCA 1937 ; 105 ALD 499 at 506 per Graham J; MZXCL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1770 at [13] per Buchanan J; Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1700 at [39] per Middleton J; Applicant M31 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 533 at [22] per Weinberg J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 702">In oral submissions today the applicant raised a number of other issues. First he contended that the Tribunal did not properly investigate his claims. He reiterated this contention in concluding submissions. However, as Gummow and Hayne JJ stated in Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [187] , it is for the applicant to advance whatever evidence or argument he or she wishes to advance in support of a contention that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason and the Tribunal must then decide whether that claim is made out. The Tribunal is not under an obligation to conduct a further investigation in the manner that appears to be contended for by the applicant. Nor is it obliged to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which an applicant chooses not to embark on (see SZMDB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1937). This is not a case in which the circumstances are such as to establish that the Tribunal undertook to make further inquiries or such as to give rise to such an obligation. </sentence>
