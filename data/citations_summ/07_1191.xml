<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1168">Recent judgments seem to assume that the issuing of a bankruptcy notice can be sufficiently regarded as connected to the judicial process because the notice is subject to setting aside by the court, or because non-compliance will give rise to a ground for bringing a bankruptcy petition, notwithstanding that the issuing of a bankruptcy notice is an administrative and non-judicial activity. It is unnecessary for me in the present case to consider whether this assumption should be questioned, or should be related to concepts of abuse of process in administrative law. Whatever the foundations for the ground, it appears to me that recent authorities, including the two I have cited above and other cases including Watts v Adelaide Bank Limited [2009] FCA 420 , and Cavoli v Etl [2007] FCA 1191 , and Yang v Mead [2009] FCA 1202 , show that the debtor needs to be able to establish an improper motive of the creditor from evidence which demonstrates that there is no legitimate justification for the serving of a bankruptcy notice in the particular circumstances. Compelling circumstantial evidence of motive is usually required. For example, where a creditor has knowledge that a debtor is clearly solvent, is able to pay the judgment debt from his liquid resources, has made reasonable offers for payment or security, and there is no apparent commercial explanation for the serving of a bankruptcy notice, the court might in the particular context infer an improper purpose for serving a bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1202">This Court also has an implied jurisdiction to set aside a bankruptcy notice as an abuse of process: Re Sterling; Ex parte Esanda Ltd [1980] FCA 61 ; (1980) 44 FLR 125. An abuse of process may be made out if the purpose in issuing the bankruptcy notice is to put pressure on a debtor to pay the debt rather than to invoke the Court's jurisdiction in relation to insolvency: Brunninghausen v Glavanics [1998] FCA 230 ; Killoran v Duncan [1999] FCA 1574 at [12] per Gyles J. See also: Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 825 , 233 ALR 81 ; Cavoli v Etl [2007] FCA 1191 at [17] , 5 ABC(NS) 363 at 369 per Heerey J; Slack v Bottoms English Solicitors [2002] FCA 1445 at [15] to [18] per Spender J; Davidova v Murphy [2009] FCA 601 at [88] . It is also an abuse of process for a judgment creditor to pursue bankruptcy proceedings " for the purpose of stifling litigation ": Bayne v Baillieu; Bayne v Riggall [1908] HCA 39 ; (1908) 6 CLR 382 at 396 per Griffith CJ. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 601">It may be most unfortunate if a bankruptcy notice were set aside in circumstances where the debtor is in fact insolvent. 

 
By way of example, in Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 825 , 233 ALR 81 Jacobson J was prepared to infer that the purpose in issuing a bankruptcy notice was to put pressure on the debtor rather than to genuinely invoke the court's bankruptcy jurisdiction in circumstances where the bankruptcy notice sought payment of a debt for a small amount based on a judgment debt which was over 5 years old; where the judgment creditor was aware of the probability of solvency; and where the judgment debtor owned assets which greatly exceeded the debt. See also: Cavoli v Etl [2007] FCA 1191 at [17] per Heerey J; Slack v Bottoms English Solicitors [2002] FCA 1445 at [15] to [18] per Spender J. It is an abuse of process for a judgment creditor to pursue bankruptcy proceedings " for the purpose of stifling litigation ": Bayne v Baillieu; Bayne v Riggall [1908] HCA 39 ; (1908) 6 CLR 382 at 396 per Griffith CJ. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 494">I was taken by counsel to the decision of Etl v Cavoli [2007] FMCA 356 as an example of case where a bankruptcy notice was found to be an abuse of process and set aside where there appeared to be evidence of a scheme to avoid the consequences of s.44(3) of the Bankruptcy Act . That decision was set aside on appeal by the Federal Court in Cavoli &amp; Etl [2007] FCA 1191 , but the general proposition in this Court's judgment was not disturbed that an abuse of process may be demonstrated by evidence of some scheme or design by a creditor to avoid the consequences of being put to an election pursuant to s.44. </sentence>
