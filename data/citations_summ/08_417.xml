<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] WASCA 32">14 The respondents said that this principle arises out of a consideration of the difference between the appellant who has lost at trial, but who 'has had his day in court', and a plaintiff prior to trial. The respondents, in this regard, referred principally to Tait v Bindal People [2002] FCA 322 [2] - [4], although reference is also made to Dranichnikov v Centrelink [2002] FCA 1622 [8] - [9] and [25]; Carey-Hazell v Getz Bros &amp; Co (Aust) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1334 [29] - [35]; Lawrance v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 417 [41] - [48]; 33 South Pty Ltd v Fitzgerald [2008] FCA 1960 [5] - [7]; and Clack v Collins (No 1) [2010] FCA 513 [8] - [12] and [28] - [31]. The respondents also referred, in support of their proposition, to cases involving applications for security for costs at first instance under the relevant corporations legislation: Westralian Gold Mines Ltd v Westralian Minerals &amp; Drilling Pty Ltd (in liq) (1986) 4 ACLC 167 ; and SAS Global Forrestdale Pty Ltd v Samsera Pty Ltd [2010] WASC 309 [52] - [55].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 796">This factor is related to the next, namely: Whether there are any persons standing behind the company who are likely to benefit from the litigation and who are willing to provide the necessary security: ... An issue related to the last guideline is whether persons standing behind the company have offered any personal undertaking to be liable for the costs and if so, the form of any such undertaking: ... Security will only ordinarily be ordered against a party who is in substance a plaintiff, and an order ought not to be made against parties who are defending themselves and thus forced to litigate: ... (citations omitted)
 
See also: Mijac Investments Pty Ltd v Graham [2008] FCA 1251 at [9] per Kenny J. The need for an application for security to be made promptly is a factor repeatedly referred to and endorsed: e.g., Crypta Fuels Pty Ltd v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd (1995) 19 ACSR 68 at 71 per Lehane J. See also: Lawrance v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 417 at [14] . Delay is an " important consideration ": Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1279 at [56] , [2006] FCA 1279 ; 155 FCR 181 at 202 per Jessup J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1340">" His Honour then considered all the alleged incidents and found that the applicant had " not established any basis for the grant of relief under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission Act" sic;
" Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act" . The application was dismissed in relation to all respondents. The applicant has appealed against that decision but on 4 April 2007 was ordered by Justice Flick to provide security for costs in respect of all respondents Lawrance v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 417. (See Affidavit of Mee (supra) at paragraph 14). The Court notes that the conduct complained of in SYG 2015 of 2006 was substantially the same as in matters SYG 2109 of 2006 and 
SYG 655 of 2007. The actual costs expended by the State of NSW were in excess of $38,000. The applicant appealed and sought a stay of costs. On 4 April 2008 Justice Flick dismissed the application for a stay of the order for costs and ordered security of costs for all respondents Lawrance v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 417 (see Affidavit of Mee, paragraph 14). At paragraph 12 Justice Flick stated: "... Second, the order as made by the Federal Magistrate is an order that would normally be expected to be made given the given dismissal by the Court of her application" Security of costs for $10,000 was ordered for the first and third to thirteenth respondents (which include the Commonwealth, DFaCSIA, CRS and AGS); security for costs of $12,000 was ordered for the second respondent (the State of NSW). In the Affidavit of Mee at paragraph 28, she states the State of NSW has incurred costs of $113,000 in responding to the applications by the applicant, and at paragraph 29 that the Guardianship Tribunal's costs exceed $37,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1060">1 Orders were previously made in this proceeding on 4 April 2008 requiring the Appellant to provide security for costs: Lawrance v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 417. Those orders required security to be provided at two stages -- the first stage required 50% of the security to be provided within 21 days of those orders being made; the second stage required the balance of the security to be provided 21 days prior to the hearing of the appeal to this Court from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: Lawrance v Commonwealth (No 5) [2007] FMCA 1934.  8 Today the Appellant has frankly -- and quite properly -- conceded that she remains unable to meet any order requiring security to be provided. Her position is that the present proceeding should remain stayed as she may ultimately prevail in a number of other proceedings she is pursuing in the Federal Magistrates Court. If ultimately successful in those other proceedings, she contends that it would be unjust to have the present proceeding in this Court dismissed. Whatever success the Appellant may or may not have in those other proceedings, however, is a matter to be resolved in those other proceedings. Appropriate orders will be made by the Federal Magistrates Court to resolve those proceedings. They have no relevance to the present proceeding, other than to possibly support a submission advanced by the Respondents that the continued pursuit of the present proceeding is either vexatious or an abuse of process. It is, however, unnecessary to resolve those submissions. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that in the reasons for decision as published on 4 April 2008 it was then concluded that none of the grounds of appeal sought to be pursued in this Court had " any real prospects of success ": [2008] FCA 417 at [26] . There is no reason to revisit that conclusion or vary it -- even if it were permissible to do so. </sentence>
