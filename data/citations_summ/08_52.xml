<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 432">It is contended for Mrs Makin that the representation must relate to the actual disease suffered by the employee and not a "class or category of disease". She submits that support for that proposition can be found in the obiter comments of Madgwick J in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Comcare [2008] FCA 52 at [55] : 
 
 
 The Tribunal dealt with the issue legally unexceptionably, in my opinion, as the factual issue it was. On such a view it is not necessary to deal with the question, not argued, whether in s 7(7) the concluding words "that disease" should be confined in their meaning to a reference to the actual disease suffered or aggravated --- so that, here, the applicant might have had to show an actual representation that the employee had not previously suffered from "an adjustment disorder with depressed mood", the disease the Tribunal found her to have, rather than, as asserted by the applicant, that she had represented herself as not having had such generally described conditions as "a mental illness", "depression", "psychiatric history" or "psychiatric disturbance".

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 469">Further elaboration of the word "material" in the definition of "disease" in s 4(1) of the Act was made more recently by Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 at 542 [15] . There, His Honour preferred the following interpretation, extracted from the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary : "In a material degree; substantially; considerably". He then noted this was consistent with the definition used in the Macquarie Dictionary and referred to by Davies J in Repatriation Commission v Bendy [1989] FCA 170 ; (1989) 10 AAR 323 at 325: "of substantial import or much consequence [rather than the] legal sense of 'pertinent' or 'likely to influence'". Finn J held at 543 [16] that the Act, by requiring "an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors", imposed a higher test than the antecedent legislation, the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 (something which the amending Act has endeavoured to address). Counsel for the Applicant pointed out that this approach was adopted with approval by Madgwick J in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Comcare [2008] FCA 52.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] AATA 560">
 
In Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Comcare [2008] FCA 52 Madgwick J said at [51-52]:
 
 ...the Tribunal relied on Wiegand [2002] FCA 1464 ; 72 ALD 795 only to reject the applicant's assertion that it needed to be shown that the workload required of Ms Caire was "excessive".</sentence>
