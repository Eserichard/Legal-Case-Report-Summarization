<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 411">1 In the primary judgment in this matter ( Seven Network v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCA 1929 ; (2007) 164 FCR 127) I concluded that a challenge by Seven Network to a decision of the ACCC to accept a special access undertaking offered by Foxtel under Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) did not succeed. However, I accepted that certain provisions forming part of the undertaking which were referred to as 'tying clauses' operated as a limitation upon the special access undertaking. At [102] of the judgment, I suggested a form of declaration which appeared to me might be suitable and appropriate to reflect the conclusions to which I had come. However, I indicated that I would take further submissions about that issue. </sentence>
