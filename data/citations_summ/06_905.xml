<citphrase id="cp5.11" type=cited from="[1981] FCA 123">bankruptcy act 1966 (cth), s. 41 (6a), (6c). in october 1980 the appellant obtained judgment in the district court in new south wales in the sum of $12,905 against the respondent. on 13th november, 1980, the respondent filed a notice of appeal. unaware of the institution of any appeal, the appellant sought the issue of a fourteen-day bankruptcy notice on 26th november, 1980, which was served on the respondent on 2nd december, 1980. on 16th december, 1980, the respondent filed an application for the extension of time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice and for an order for setting it aside. an extension of time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice was granted ex parte and was later further extended, whereupon the appellant filed an application for orders setting aside the orders extending time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice. so that both applications could be heard together the time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice was extended to 6th april, 1981, and both applications were adjourned to that date.  on 6th april, 1981, the court was unable to deal with the applications and adjourned them to the following afternoon. no orders extending time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice were then sought or made. on the following day counsel for the appellant submitted that it would be futile to purport to grant any further extension of time as time had expired and an act of bankruptcy had been committed. the judge in the course of the hearing which extended over three days purported to extend the time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice and on 9th april, 1981, made orders extending the time for compliance until further order. against that order the appellant appealed.  held: per deane and ellicott jj., sheppard j. dissenting. section 41 (6a) of the bankruptcy act 1966 confers jurisdiction on the court to make orders extending the time for compliance with a bankruptcy notice notwithstanding the fact that at the time of making the order the time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice has already expired, provided that one of the two limbs of sub-s. (6a) has been fulfilled.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 794">37 The respondent submits that this paragraph constitutes notice for the purposes of s 41(5) and is wide enough to cover all of the missed credits and payments; alternatively, it is wide enough to cover at least the alleged misstatements related to the PAYG payments and garnishee payments. I am satisfied that notice for the purposes of s 41(5) could be given by means of an affidavit served on a creditor. The section is silent as to the method of giving notice and it is not necessary in giving notice to expressly refer to s 41(5): Hussain v King Investment Solutions [2006] FCA 905 ; (2006) 153 FCR 428 at [19] - [20].</sentence>
