<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] HCA 48">Finally, it should be mentioned that in upholding the appeal before it, the Federal Court referred [39] to the Tribunal's failure to refer to the effects of delay and the requirement for the first respondent to repeat evidence, and in doing so referred to both NAIS [40] and SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [41] . 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 558">In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that any delay that occurred in this case is such that it can be inferred that there was a real and substantial risk that the Tribunal's capacity to assess the applicant's evidence and evaluate her claims was impaired so that she was denied a fair hearing. In reaching this conclusion I have had regard to the fact that while the applicant's credibility was in issue and hence her demeanour was relevant to some extent to the Tribunal's decision, the Tribunal did not simply announce its conclusions on credibility, but rather provided closely reasoned explanations for its disbelief of various aspects of the applicant's claims which led it to the conclusion that the applicant was not a witness of truth. Its reasoning was not based on inconsistencies in her oral evidence at the various hearings. While there were hearings on three occasions, this is not a matter in which the Tribunal had to weigh up the credibility of oral evidence given to it on widely separated occasions (see NAIS at [168]). Nor is it a case in which the Tribunal allowed so much time to pass that it could be inferred that it could no longer assess the evidence proffered by the applicant. Where inconsistencies were in issue, they were inconsistencies between written and oral evidence rather than in various oral accounts that the applicant had given over time and, importantly, the inconsistencies identified were " both real and substantial " and were properly analysed, as were the other matters relied on by the Tribunal (cf SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 102 ALD 366 ; [2008] FCA 913 at [97] --- [98] per Weinberg J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 535">Ground one also asserts that when the Tribunal assessed the applicant's credibility it failed to engage in a proper, genuine and realistic consideration of the psychologist's report prepared and provided after the Tribunal hearing, in particular the psychologist's opinion that because of the applicant's impaired mental state her " response pattern may compromise [her] apparent credibility...and her capacity to effectively represent her claims ". It was said to be insufficient for the Tribunal simply to say that it had considered the psychologist's report. Rather, it was contended that where there was evidence central to the issue of credibility (as this report was said to be), there was an extra requirement on the Tribunal to give reasons why such material did not change its view on credibility. In oral submissions this was said to be consistent with the approach taken by Weinberg J in SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 102 ALD 366 ; [2008] FCA 913. Other cases were also addressed in the applicant's oral submissions, as discussed below. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 510">The Tribunal accepted that the applicant had given evidence on four occasions and that, in the words of Weinberg J in SZIIF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 913: a person who is required to provide over and over again a detailed account of events long after they have occurred will almost certainly be unable to recount them in identical terms. 
However, the Tribunal found that the contradictions in the applicant's evidence, summarised below, were so great that they cast doubt on the truthfulness of his assertions:
 at the first hearing before the Tribunal the applicant claimed that he was attacked by Maoists in 1996, that they entered his house, took him to their base camp and beat him the whole night, leaving him unconscious. However, when asked at the third Tribunal hearing about the problems he had had in his village, the applicant did not initially mention being attacked at all and when the Tribunal specifically referred to his previous claims the applicant stated that it had been more of a pushing and shoving; at the second Tribunal hearing the applicant claimed that he did not feel safe in the five, six or seven years after he moved to Kathmandu in 1997, moving from place to place every one or two months. However, this was inconsistent with the evidence in his original application (and later confirmed by the applicant at the third Tribunal hearing), that he had lived at a single address in Kathmandu from March 1997 until his departure from Nepal in 2007 and had worked as the head cook in a hotel from June 1997 until February 2007; and in his original application the applicant claimed that he was attacked by Maoists twice in 2006, a claim which he repeated at the first and second Tribunal hearings. However, at the third Tribunal hearing the applicant stated that these attacks occurred some time in 2001 or 2002. The Tribunal considered that, if he were telling the truth, the applicant would have been able to remember if these attacks had taken place in the year before, or five or six years before, he left Nepal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 679">In NAIS and Others v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 228 CLR 470 at [37] the phrase ' proper, genuine and realistic consideration ' was used in respect of the jurisdictional error disclosed. Such jurisdictional error related to excessive delays by the Tribunal which had compromised its ability to consider fairly the case before it and thereby to fulfil its obligations pursuant to s 425 of the Act. Such decision was referred to by Raphael FM in his decision. Further, his Honour referred to the decision in SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 913 ; (2008) 102 ALD 366 in which Weinberg J said at [98]: 
 
 However, when one adds to the mix the fact that none of the inconsistencies identified were properly analysed, several seemed to have misstated the appellant's earlier position, and some involved summaries taken out of context, the entire process appears to have gone badly wrong. To use the language of Gummow J in NAIS , the Tribunal did not give "proper, genuine and realistic" consideration to the appellant's case. He was not afforded the hearing to which the law entitled him.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] RRTA 278">In the present case, as I put to the applicant in the course of the hearing before me, I consider that there are good reasons for concluding that he is not telling the truth about his reasons for leaving China and coming to Australia. I accept that the applicant has now given evidence in relation to his claims on three occasions and I accept that, as was said in SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 913 , it is necessary to bear this in mind when considering the inconsistencies in the applicant's account. Nevertheless, there are significant inconsistencies in the applicant's account which I consider are not explained by the number of times the applicant has given an account of what he claims happened in China I consider that these inconsistencies go to whether the applicant is telling the truth about the events which he claims prompted him to leave China in December 2006 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 75">Mr Young referred to a recent decision of this Court in which Scarlett FM appeared to accept that failure to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the decision under review constitutes a jurisdictional error; SZKGC v Minister for Immigration [2009] FMCA 1015 at [41] . His Honour referred to Weinberg J's decision SZIIF v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 913 (" SZIIF ") which, in turn, quoted heavily from NAIS v Minister for Immigration [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 228 CLR 470 (" NAIS "). In that case, the High Court was concerned with the effect of excessive delays in the RRT on the decision-maker's ability to fairly consider the case before it. In a joint judgment Callinan and Heydon JJ accepted that s.425 refers, by implication, to a hearing where the evidence given is to be given " proper, genuine and realistic consideration " in the decision subsequently to be made [171]. Because of the extraordinary delay between the oral hearings and the decision in that case, the Tribunal had disabled itself from being able to give proper consideration to the decision under review in much the same way as bias does. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FMCA 45">As to Ground 12, a failure to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the applicant's claim that a person involved in the drug trade and a person of the notoriety of Mr Silva might seek to harm someone such as the applicant, Mr Young conceded that merits review is a matter for the Tribunal and want of logic does not of itself suffice to constitute error of law. However, flawed reasoning might also support a conclusion that the Tribunal had approached its task without making a genuine attempt to consider the evidence favouring the applicant (see SZIAY V Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [35] per Smith FM at [7]; SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [36] per Weinberg J, who accepted that if a Tribunal does not give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the applicant's case, the applicant will not be afforded the hearing to which he or she is entitled by law.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 1577">I am also of opinion that the third tribunal's reasons do not recognise expressly the effects of the delay that had been occasioned in the determination of the appellants' claims through no fault of their own and the consequential need for the husband to repeat his evidence on at least three occasions to the three differently constituted tribunals. This was a factor that Weinberg J noted could have significance in the evaluation of whether the tribunal had made a jurisdictional error in particular circumstances: SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 913 ; (2008) 102 ALD 366 at 380 [83] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] RRTA 1114">As I put to the applicant, it appeared to me from the way he talked about this that he was talking about things which had happened to other people, not things which had happened to him. As I put to him, this sort of thing goes to whether I accept that he is telling the truth about these events. The applicant asserted that he was telling the truth but as I put to him he contradicted himself in the evidence he gave to me at the hearing. I do not accept that, as the applicant said, he misunderstood the question When I asked him what problems he had he did not initially mention being attacked at all and even after I specifically referred to the fact that he had claimed previously that he had been attacked in his village he said that it had been more of a pushing and shoving. I accept that the applicant has given his evidence on four occasions (in his original application and at three hearings before the Tribunal) and that, as Weinberg J observed in SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 913 at [60] , 'a person who is required to provide over and over again a detailed account of events long after they have occurred will almost certainly be unable to recount them in identical terms'.

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 1015">The phrase "proper, genuine and realistic consideration" appears, interestingly enough in the dissenting decision of Gummow J: Even Gummow J, in dissent, noted at [37] that counsel for the Minister: "...accepted that it is implicit in the reference in s 425 to a hearing where evidence may be given that the challenge to the decision under review by the RRT be given a proper, genuine and realistic consideration in the decision to be subsequently made by the RRT. " Gummow J seems to have accepted as correct the concession on behalf of the Minister that the Tribunal was obliged to give "proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the case. Implicitly, his Honour also accepted that this requirement did not involve merits review. [49]  Mr Young submitted that it is a proper and recognised ground ( NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [33] ; SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [34] per Weinberg J at [67]; SZHYW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [35] per Nicholls FM at [13]; and SZLPG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [36] per Smith FM at [26]).  In SZIIF , Weinberg J found that the third Tribunal had erred by not giving proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the decision under review: Had the inconsistencies that T3 [50] identified been both real and substantial, one might well understand how it arrived at its conclusion. Even then, it would have been highly desirable for T3 to have stated expressly that it had taken into account the dangers associated with drawing sweeping conclusions from what on any view was a mere handful of discrepancies. However, when one adds to the mix the fact that none of the inconsistencies identified were properly analysed, several seemed to have misstated the appellant's earlier position, and some involved summaries taken out of context, the entire process appears to have gone badly wrong. To use the language of Gummow J in NAIS, the Tribunal did not give "proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the appellant's case. He was not afforded the hearing to which the law entitled him. In my view, the Federal Magistrate erred in dismissing the appellant's complaints by treating the Tribunal as having "implicitly" taken into account matters that I frankly doubt it ever considered. [51] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FMCA 886">Mr Young submits that the Tribunal failed to take into account the effect of delay and that the applicant had to repeat a detailed account of past history when Tribunal 3 was assessing his credibility: SZIIF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 913 ; (2008) 102 ALD 366. In that case, three Tribunal hearings were held over for a four year period and the applicant was required to provide accounts of his past persecution on several occasions. Justice Weinberg determined that there was jurisdictional error in the Tribunal decision because: The Tribunal erred in the finding that there were discrepancies of any consequence between the applicant's earlier statements and what he said during the course of the hearing, which showed that the Tribunal had no proper basis for concluding that the applicant had invented a history of persecution in order to obtain a visa: SZIIF at [57]; and The Tribunal did not take into account the effect of delay in considering any possible inconsistencies between the statements the applicant had made regarding his past persecution: SZIIF at [60], [90]. Critical to the Court's determination in SZIIF where the findings relied upon by the Tribunal about discrepancies between the applicant's accounts of his past persecution on different occasions. For example, between what he had said at his Departmental interview and then four years later before the third Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] RRTA 625">The attacks were clearly significant in terms of the refugee claim the applicant makes and his failure to mention them in his initial claim suggests to the Tribunal that they did not occur. The Tribunal further notes that, in the written statement he gave to T1, he said that the second of the attacks occurred in 2005 near a shopping centre. In his later evidence he said that the attack occurred while he was in a garment shop at a shopping centre with his family In assessing the applicant's claims, the Tribunal should not of course focus on minor inconsistencies of fact in the applicant's story, especially where the applicant has been asked to recount his story on several occasions ( SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 913). Inconsistencies can occur for a variety of reasons unconnected with an applicant's credibility. However, the Tribunal expects that an applicant will be able to give a coherent account of central elements of his or her claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FamCAFC 87">The issue that then arises is the effect of a delay in the provision of reasons. Particular issues arise in relation to the adequacy of reasons where there is long delay between completing the hearing and the delivery of reasons. The consequence of a lengthy delay on the adequacy of reasons has been considered in a number of cases including of the Full Court of the Family Court: Goose v Wilson Sandford and Co (1998) 142 SJLB 92 per the English Court of Appeal; R v Maxwell (1998) 217 ALR 452 (" R v Maxwell ") per the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal; H &amp; H &amp; O [2001] FamCA 113 per the Full Court; Expectation Pty Ltd v PRD Realty Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 189 ; (2004) 209 ALR 568 per the Full Court of the Federal Court; Monie v the Commonwealth [2005] NSWCA 25 ; [2005] NSWCA 25 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 729 (" Monie ") per the New South Wales Court of Appeal; NAIS and Others v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 228 CLR 470 (" NAIS ") per the High Court; McCrossen and McCrossen [2006] FamCA 868 ; (2006) FLC 93-283 (" McCrossen ") per the Full Court; Sea Containers Ltd v ICT Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 327 (" Sea Containers Ltd ") per the New South Wales Court of Appeal; Fox v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2007] FCAFC 150 per the Full Court of the Federal Court; Mastronardi v New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 54 (" Mastronardi ") per the New South Wales Court of Appeal; and SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 913 ; (2008) 102 ALD 366 (" SZIIF ") per Weinberg J. As Basten JA at [63] observed in Mastronardi "[a] complaint about prolonged or inordinate delay in delivering reasons has gained some popularity in recent years, although it does not threaten the popularity of the challenge based on the inadequacy of reasons. However, it does share some of the uncertainty as to its basis in principle". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FCA 101">The applicant also submits that any inconsistencies in the applicant's evidence regarding the assassination of the politician resulted from delay in the review process. The applicant relies upon the decision of this Court in SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 913 ; (2008) 102 ALD 366. In such decision Weinberg J concluded that many of the inconsistencies between the various accounts of the applicant could be explained by the fact that 'he was obliged over the next four years to recall repeatedly the details of events that must have become more difficult to remember with the passage of time' and thus 'the Tribunal was obliged to take that aspect of the delay into account when considering any possible inconsistencies between the various statements that he made regarding these events. ' [89-90]. Weinberg J referred to the decision of the High Court of Australia in NAIS and others v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 228 CLR 470 in which there had been a prolonged delay by the Tribunal, it having conducted oral hearings on 6 May 1998 and again on 19 December 2001 before delivering its judgment on 14 January 2003. Weinberg J observed at paragraph 83 that such decision was authority for the proposition that a lengthy delay 'unacknowledged by the Tribunal in its reasons for decision' could give rise to jurisdictional error. </sentence>

 The Appeal 
 
 The gravamen of the case advanced by the appellant in the appeal was that a critical finding made by the Tribunal that there was independent evidence indicating that it was persons who are members of royalist political parties who may be targeted by the youth wing of the Maoists was not sustainable having regard to the independent evidence. That is, none of the independent evidence contained a statement to this effect. In support of this submission, counsel for the appellant referred to observations of Weinberg J in SZIIF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 913 at [64] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] FMCA 1197">I do not accept that the Tribunal's reliance on these inconsistencies in support of its adverse credibility finding takes its decision into the territory identified by Weinberg J in SZIIF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 913. In that case, a Tribunal had built an adverse credibility finding on a variety of inconsistencies in evidence given by an applicant over four years on seven separate occasions. His Honour characterised the general inadequacy of the Tribunal's reasoning: [97] Had the inconsistencies that T3 identified been both real and substantial, one might well understand how it arrived at its conclusion. Even then, it would have been highly desirable for T3 to have stated expressly that it had taken into account the dangers associated with drawing sweeping conclusions from what on any view was a mere handful of discrepancies. [98] However, when one adds to the mix the fact that none of the inconsistencies identified were properly analysed, several seemed to have misstated the appellant's earlier position, and some involved summaries taken out of context, the entire process appears to have gone badly wrong. To use the language of Gummow J in NAIS, the Tribunal did not give "proper, genuine and realistic" consideration to the appellant's case. He was not afforded the hearing to which the law entitled him. 
In the present case, I would not arrive at a conclusion that the Tribunal's reasoning, provided in its statement of reasons, reveals that "the entire process appears to have gone badly wrong ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FMCA 952">Nor did counsel elaborate his written submission that the Tribunal's reasoning at this point could be characterised as revealing the absence of "proper, genuine and realistic consideration of the applicant's case ", in its reliance upon inconsistencies in the father's evidence.

However, the phrase regained life in the High Court's judgment in NAIS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 228 CLR 470 at [9] - [10], [37], [171]-[172], and was applied recently by Weinberg J in SZIIF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 913 at [98] . </sentence>
