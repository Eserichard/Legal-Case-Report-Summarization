<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWADTAP 23">3 If the Tribunal's decision that it has jurisdiction to hear the application is an interlocutory decision, leave is required before an appeal can proceed: ADT Act , s 113(2A). While 'interlocutory decision' is not defined in the ADT Act , s 24A defines 'interlocutory function' to mean the making of any order or other decision by the Tribunal in proceedings with respect to certain matters including 'summary dismissal of proceedings' and 'any other interlocutory issue before the Tribunal'. The question of whether a decision about jurisdiction is an interlocutory decision was discussed in Applicant S 1494/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 2008 FCA 286 ; 166 FCR 474. In the course of that decision, Reeves J raised the question of whether a dismissal on the basis of a lack of jurisdiction is a final or an interlocutory order and noted that the Full Court of the Federal Court had held that such an order is an interlocutory order 'at least where the order does not necessarily finally dispose of the rights of the parties': Applicant NAGM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 395 at [6] . In this case the Tribunal's orders did not finally dispose of the rights of the parties. The Tribunal has not yet carried out a review of the Department's decision. Consequently the decision is an interlocutory decision and leave is required before the appeal can proceed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 277">The applicant's challenge was in substance directed to the dismissal of his judicial review application on the grounds of res judicata or estoppel. For the reasons set out most recently in SBFF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 178 at [6] ---[10], this gave rise to a final as opposed to an interlocutory judgment: compare, recently, Applicant S1494/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 286 at [16] , [22] and Brock v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCAFC 165 at [45] - [46] , [53]. It follows that the applicant had an appeal as of right. In this event, I would treat the Notice of Appeal, to which the handwritten word "draft" has later been added, as a Notice of Appeal filed in accordance with O 52 r 15 of the Federal Court Rules . For the reasons stated, I would dismiss the appeal. </sentence>
