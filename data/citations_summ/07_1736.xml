<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 965">[27] See generally Further Amended Points of Defence, para.122(a) and particulars thereto; G E Dal Pont, Law of Agency (Chatswood, NSW: Butterworths, 2001) para.4.5, page 93. [28] "Pilot Principals". As to the discretionary nature of the order under s.719(6) of the post-reform WR Act see Claveria v Pilkington Australia Limited [2007] FCA 1692 ; (2007) 167 IR 444 at 478-479 (para.147); AFMEPKIU v Mechanical Engineering Services Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1736 at para.21 (" Mechanical Engineering Services "); Flattery v Italian Eatery [2007] FMCA 9 ; (2007) 163 IR 14 at 29 (para.71). [29] [1996] VicRp 67 ; [1996] 2 VR 235 (" Ryan "). [30] Ryan at 239-243, 251, 254 and 267-268.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1249">9 So far as penalty is concerned, the maximum that can be imposed for each contravention is 300 penalty units (ie $33,000): s 719(4). When there are numerous breaches arising out of a single course of conduct they are to be taken to be a single breach: s 719(2). If regard is had to the facts (as to which see my judgment in Automotive, Food, Metals Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union v Mechanical Engineering Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1736) , it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that for penalty purposes there have been only two breaches. They are breaches of: (1) cl 4.4.3 of the award (failing to make the redundancy payments); and (2) cl 4.3.1 (failing to make payments in lieu of notice). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 947">It finds earlier reflection in ss 190(4) and 191of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and O 33, O 34 and O 34B of the Federal Court Rules . [128] Another, fourth principle, is that the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment is to be made as a question of law and reviewed as such by the appellate court. Although ss 31A(1)-(2) state that the court "may" give summary judgment, the word "may" is used here in its empowering sense, not in a discretionary sense: Leach v R [2007] HCA 3 ; (2007) 230 CLR 1 at [38] ; Finance Facilities Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1971) 127 CLR 106 at 134-35 and Automotive, Food, Metals Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union v Mechanical Engineering Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1736 at [21] (collecting cases where the use of "may" in a statute was "to confer a power and not a discretion"). ... [129] As in the cases cited, s 31A must be read as conferring a power while indicating the circumstances in which it is to be used, ie, when there is "no reasonable prospect of success". To construe the statute otherwise would give judges discretion to allow even hopeless cases to proceed, which could not have been within the contemplation of a legislature that intended to make summary judgment easier to obtain.</sentence>

 It is true that [the statute] states that the court 'may' order that the prisoner in question is not to be eligible for parole. The power thus reposed in the court is conditioned upon a determination by the court that it considers that the making of the order 'is appropriate'.</sentence>
