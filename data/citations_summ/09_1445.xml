<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 403">Leave to appeal in respect of the judgment whereby, materially, the payment of costs to be taxed was ordered has been given: see Food Channel Network Pty Ltd v Television Food Network, GP [2009] FCA 1445. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1446">As to the second condition (above), I explained in Food Channel Network Pty Ltd v Television Food Network G.P [2009] FCA 1445 , that the sufficiency of the doubt about the interlocutory judgment and the extent of the potential injustice involved, must be balanced against each other and not considered in isolation: see at [14]. For similar reasons, I consider that the explanation for the delay and the requirement to show special reasons should also be included in the same balancing process. In other words, if Channel's case is strong on its merits and if it can show substantial injustice will flow if leave is not granted, I consider I should be less demanding in relation to its explanation for delay and the special reasons it is required to show. In this respect, I note, and respectfully agree with, what appears to be a similar approach, outlined by Rares J in SZJFC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1322 at [20] --- [21]. </sentence>
