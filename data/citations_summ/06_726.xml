<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 309">2 In Nokia Corporation v Cellular Line Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 726 , delivered on 14 June 2006, the Court held that the first and second respondents had infringed the applicant's trademarks and, as they had failed to establish any arguable defence, the applicant was entitled to summary judgment against them. Further, the third and fourth respondents admitted, in essence, that they had infringed the applicant's trademarks. The Court made orders accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] VCAT 335">23 Finally, in relation to the example of costs being apportioned by the Court in Nokia (supra) this is an example of the discretion an adjudicator has when it comes to costs. However, I consider that in this case Kenny .J. gave reasons for why she apportioned the damages and it was due to her perception of the hearing and the parties participation. In the final paragraph of her substantive decision in Nokia Corporation v Cellular Line Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 726 she said: 

 'At the hearing, I suggested to the parties that they might turn their heads to whether or not costs should be equally proportioned between the respondents. It seemed to me that the third and fourth respondents had not seriously contested the summary judgment motion; and this should be reflected in the costs order. I also noted, and Counsel for Nokia agreed, that the third and fourth respondents were alleged to have engaged in a lower volume of infringing conduct than the first and second respondents. I propose to hear the parties on the matter of costs after delivering these reasons. ' 
 
 Therefore, in the circumstances of the Nokia case it appears appropriate that the damages were apportioned. Therefore, I do not consider that at law or in the exercise of my discretion the costs to the respondents should be apportioned in the same proportions as to my findings of their apportioned liability.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 980">1 On 14 June 2006, I delivered reasons for judgment and ordered that there be summary judgment for the applicant against the respondents: Nokia Corporation v Cellular Line Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 726 (" Nokia "). I assume familiarity with those reasons. At [61] I noted that:
 
 "At the hearing, I suggested to the parties that they might turn their minds to whether or not costs should be equally proportioned between the respondents. It seemed to me that the third and fourth respondents had not seriously contested the summary judgment motion; and that this should be reflected in any costs order. I also noted, and counsel for Nokia agreed, that the third and fourth respondents were alleged to have engaged in a lower volume of infringing conduct than the first and second respondents. I proposed to hear the parties on the matter of costs after delivering these reasons. " 

I ordered that the parties file written submissions on costs. The disposition of costs now falls for determination.
