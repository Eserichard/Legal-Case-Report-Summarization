<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 765">In Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCA 875 , another summary dismissal case under s 31A(2) , Tamberlin J said at [14]: 
 '... it is essential that the Court must be careful not to do an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings, or denying an applicant an opportunity to ventilate their case. ...' 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 266">Having said that, it remains the case that: the court should approach an application for summary dismissal with caution: Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [6] ; summary judgment should not be granted if there is a genuine factual dispute between the parties, including disputes about matters of fact and degree: Boston at [45] and Dandaven at [6]; and as was said in Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCA 875: the court must be careful not to do an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings, or denying an applicant an opportunity to ventilate their case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1461">
 

24 Although there has been debate about whether the word "may" in s 31A(2) vests in the Court a power conditional on certain facts being found or discretion (see, for example, Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd (2008) 167 FCR 372 ; [2008] FCAFC 60 at [127] --- [128] and JF Keir Pty Ltd v Sparks [2008] FCA 611 at [12] ), certain aspects of the operation of the provision are clear. First, s 31A(3) , in terms, discloses that s 31A(2) involves a less stringent test than that applicable at common law for summary dismissal. Secondly, and as Rares J observed in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; [2006] FCA 1352 at [46] , " s 31A regulates the attainment of justice by creating an entitlement in a party to be protected from claims or defences which fail to meet the threshold prescribed in the section". Thirdly, and again as Rares J said in Boston Commercial Services at [45], "in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s 31A , the court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing the proceedings where... contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed. As soon as the evidence may have such an ambivalent character prior to a final determination, I am of opinion that then, as a matter of law, at that point there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s 31A. Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, the moving party will not have discharged its onus to enliven the discretion to authorise a summary termination of the proceedings which s 31A envisages". This is consistent with the statement by Tamberlin J in Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCA 875 at [14] that "... it is essential that the Court must be careful not to do an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings, or denying an applicant an opportunity to ventilate their case ...". Fourthly, and as Lindgren J noted in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 160 FCR 298 ; [2007] FCA 511 at [50] , s 31A "is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 647">Her first general argument implied that the police were complicit in racially discriminatory policies or actions on the part of the University officials, which had led her to take peaceful protest action at the Chancellery, and to refuse to comply with University requests that she leave its premises. However, there is no evidence of any communications between University officials and the police which did anything more than confirm her trespasses at the Chancellery on each occasion. Moreover, Mrs Paramasivam has never been able to establish any discriminatory conduct by the University, and her attempt to establish this was summarily dismissed (see: Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCA 875 , and Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCAFC 176). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 611">14 In Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCA 875 , another summary dismissal case under s 31A(2) , Tamberlin J said at [14]:
 '... it is essential that the Court must be careful not to do an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings, or denying an applicant an opportunity to ventilate their case. ...' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 473">14 In Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCA 875 , another summary dismissal case under s 31A(2) , Tamberlin J said at [14]:

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCAFC 176">1 Ms Paramasivam appeals from a decision of Tamberlin J of 19 June 2007: Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCA 875. His Honour summarily dismissed an application made under s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) (the HREOC Act) by which Ms Paramasivam complained that the University of New South Wales (UNSW) had racially discriminated against her, contrary to s 9 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (the RDA).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FMCA 1788">
It has been accepted by the Federal Court that, as articulated by Lindgren J in White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [54] :
 
 "Under s.31A I must be satisfied that the applicants have no reasonable prospect of success, but as s.31A makes clear, this does not mean that I must be satisfied that the proceeding is hopeless or bound to fail. I suggest that the legislature's intention was to lower the bar for summary dismissal below the level that had been fixed. "

Support can also be found for the statement of French J in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 , where his Honour disagreed with Heerey J's view in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 that "[s]ection 31A was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeouts". French J considered that s.31A "allows for "judgment" or nothing" at [21]; see also JT Nominees Pty Ltd v Macks [2007] SASC 151 at [81] per Bleby J.</sentence>
