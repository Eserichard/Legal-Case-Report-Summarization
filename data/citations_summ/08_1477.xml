<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 408">The Tribunal's review is informal, but the Tribunal is required to accord procedural fairness to the parties to a review: s 39 of the AAT Act, and see Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 ; Donnelly v Repatriation Commission (1987) 73 ALR 350 ; 3D Scaffolding Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1477 ; Kowalski v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2010] FCAFC 10 at [57] and the cases there cited. It must receive the reasons for decision of the decision-maker whose decision is under review and the relevant material before that person: s 37 of the AAT Act. The parties must be given an opportunity to present evidence and to make submissions: s 39, AAT Act. It may also obtain further information from the decision-maker: s 38, AAT Act. Hence, it is clear that the Tribunal must ultimately make its decision on the matter before it in accordance with those processes. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1475">As the written submissions for the Minister note, there has been some debate in the cases as to whether the rule in Browne v Dunn applies to proceedings in the Tribunal; cf Lawrance v Centrelink [2005] FCA 1318 ; (2005) 88 ALD 664 at [31] per Hely J and Haberfield v Department of Veterans Affairs as delegate for Comcare [2002] FCA 1579 ; (2002) 121 FCR 233 at [58] per Sackville J. Ultimately, the rule is an aspect of procedural fairness and like other elements of procedural fairness its application "depends on the circumstances of the particular case"; 3D Scaffolding Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1477 ; (2008) 105 ALD 475 per Edmonds J at [21]. Thus, as his Honour said: 
 
 Where the Tribunal makes a finding contrary to the evidence of a witness in the circumstances where the matter found was not put to the witness, this will generally involve a denial of procedural fairness and would be a denial of natural justice on the part of the tribunal to do so. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 75">16 In dismissing the appeal by 3D Scaffolding under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunals Act, the learned primary judge held that:
 
(1) appeal grounds claiming that the Tribunal failed to determine, as it should have done, that amounts paid by 3D Scaffolding were for the hire of scaffolding and/or the acquisition of scaffolding did not raise any question of law for the purposes of s 44(1); and, in any case, there was not error of the kind alleged because the identity of the payee was relevant and 3D Scaffolding's case was that the outgoings were paid to Mr Borg: see 3D Scaffolding Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1477 at [12] - [14]. (2) the rule in Browne v Dunn applied to the proceedings in the AAT and the application of the rule depended on the circumstances of the case: see 3D Scaffolding [2008] FCA 1477 at [18] - [21]. (3) there was no breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn or denial of procedural fairness as regards Mrs Montgomery and the Price Spreadsheets because:
 
 (a) both Mrs Montgomery and 3D Scaffolding were on notice from the questions put to Mrs Montgomery that the Price Spreadsheets were under challenge;
 
 (b) the particular discrepancies identified in Annexure A were identified and apparent from the Price Spreadsheets themselves when compared with 3D Scaffolding's Job Balance records;
 
 (c) the Price Spreadsheets were Mrs Montgomery's creation and the Job Balance records were 3D Scaffolding's business records; and 
 
 (d) while the Price Spreadsheets might have been recognised by the Commissioner as "the central plank in the Applicants' case", they were not the central plank in the Tribunal's decision. See 3D Scaffolding [2008] FCA 1477 at [22] . (4) Even if there had been a denial of procedural fairness, the Tribunal's decision in respect of 3D Scaffolding was clearly correct and there was no utility in remitting the matter: see 3D Scaffolding [2008] FCA 1477 at [24] .
  16 In dismissing the appeal by 3D Scaffolding under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunals Act, the learned primary judge held that:
 
(1) appeal grounds claiming that the Tribunal failed to determine, as it should have done, that amounts paid by 3D Scaffolding were for the hire of scaffolding and/or the acquisition of scaffolding did not raise any question of law for the purposes of s 44(1); and, in any case, there was not error of the kind alleged because the identity of the payee was relevant and 3D Scaffolding's case was that the outgoings were paid to Mr Borg: see 3D Scaffolding Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1477 at [12] - [14]. (2) the rule in Browne v Dunn applied to the proceedings in the AAT and the application of the rule depended on the circumstances of the case: see 3D Scaffolding [2008] FCA 1477 at [18] - [21]. (3) there was no breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn or denial of procedural fairness as regards Mrs Montgomery and the Price Spreadsheets because:
 
 (a) both Mrs Montgomery and 3D Scaffolding were on notice from the questions put to Mrs Montgomery that the Price Spreadsheets were under challenge;
 
 (b) the particular discrepancies identified in Annexure A were identified and apparent from the Price Spreadsheets themselves when compared with 3D Scaffolding's Job Balance records;
 
 (c) the Price Spreadsheets were Mrs Montgomery's creation and the Job Balance records were 3D Scaffolding's business records; and 
 
 (d) while the Price Spreadsheets might have been recognised by the Commissioner as "the central plank in the Applicants' case", they were not the central plank in the Tribunal's decision. See 3D Scaffolding [2008] FCA 1477 at [22] . (4) Even if there had been a denial of procedural fairness, the Tribunal's decision in respect of 3D Scaffolding was clearly correct and there was no utility in remitting the matter: see 3D Scaffolding [2008] FCA 1477 at [24] .

  44 The primary judge considered that "the Tribunal found that Mr [James] Docherty was the controller of 3D independently of its finding that he was the sole director of 3D" and that "its erroneous finding as to Mr Docherty's status as the sole director of 3D during the relevant years did not contribute to its conclusion that Mr Docherty was the controller of 3D": see 3D Scaffolding [2008] FCA 1477 at [31] . 43 It was common ground that the Tribunal was mistaken in finding that James Docherty was the sole director of 3D Scaffolding during the relevant tax years. The primary judge also acknowledged that the Tribunal had fallen into error in this regard, noting that "[i]n the years of income 1998 --- 2000, there was a second director, Robert Docherty, who held that position from 6 November 1996 to 18 October 2002": see 3D Scaffolding [2008] FCA 1477 at [25] . His Honour did not, however, accept that the Tribunal's error in finding that James Docherty was the sole director of 3D Scaffolding during the years of income 1998 --- 2000 was material to its decision. Thus, his Honour said (at [28]):
 In my view, its findings that Mr Docherty controlled 3D, that '3D did exactly as he directed' [152], and that 'Docherty treated 3D as his own and took its money for his own use': [153], were made independently of and did not depend upon the Tribunal's erroneous finding that Mr [James] Docherty was the sole director of 3D during the relevant years. In other words, the Tribunal's erroneous finding merely fortified the Tribunal's anterior findings as to Mr Docherty's control of 3D's operations.  16 In dismissing the appeal by 3D Scaffolding under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunals Act, the learned primary judge held that:
 
(1) appeal grounds claiming that the Tribunal failed to determine, as it should have done, that amounts paid by 3D Scaffolding were for the hire of scaffolding and/or the acquisition of scaffolding did not raise any question of law for the purposes of s 44(1); and, in any case, there was not error of the kind alleged because the identity of the payee was relevant and 3D Scaffolding's case was that the outgoings were paid to Mr Borg: see 3D Scaffolding Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1477 at [12] - [14]. (2) the rule in Browne v Dunn applied to the proceedings in the AAT and the application of the rule depended on the circumstances of the case: see 3D Scaffolding [2008] FCA 1477 at [18] - [21]. (3) there was no breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn or denial of procedural fairness as regards Mrs Montgomery and the Price Spreadsheets because:
 
 (a) both Mrs Montgomery and 3D Scaffolding were on notice from the questions put to Mrs Montgomery that the Price Spreadsheets were under challenge;
 
 (b) the particular discrepancies identified in Annexure A were identified and apparent from the Price Spreadsheets themselves when compared with 3D Scaffolding's Job Balance records;
 
 (c) the Price Spreadsheets were Mrs Montgomery's creation and the Job Balance records were 3D Scaffolding's business records; and 
 
 (d) while the Price Spreadsheets might have been recognised by the Commissioner as "the central plank in the Applicants' case", they were not the central plank in the Tribunal's decision. See 3D Scaffolding [2008] FCA 1477 at [22] .

  46 The primary judge rejected this argument and the underlying contention, upon the basis that "there was ample evidence to support the conclusion of the Tribunal that Mr [James] Docherty controlled 3D and that, when he caused payments out to himself, they were payments by 3D and not a misappropriation of its moneys" and that "[t]he Tribunal's incorrect finding that Mr Docherty was the sole director was not necessary or relevant to the decision of the Tribunal that there had been payments made by 3D and Div 7A should apply": see 3D Scaffolding [2008] FCA 1477 at [37] .
