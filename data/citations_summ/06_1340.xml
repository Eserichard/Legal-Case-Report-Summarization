<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 89">15 The appellant complained on the present appeal that the motion for contempt for the failure to pay the fine ought to have been brought by the District Registrar in a new proceeding before the Full Court rather than in the principal proceedings. He contended that in any proceedings brought by the District Registrar the respondent to the principal proceedings should not have been a named party. The primary judge correctly rejected that submission: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 5) [2006] FCA 1340 at [5] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1612">10 The second objection was framed thus:
 
 
 "(a) The Contempt Charges herein have been brought in the wrong proceeding and in the wrong Court, and should have been brought either in matter number 376 of 2006 or, alternatively, in a new separate a discretely numbered proceeding and, in any event, in the Full Court. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) The Victorian District Registrar proceeded on Directions which were incorrectly made in matter number 1607 of 2005, by Tracey J, sitting in the Trial Division, rather than on a Direction given by a Member of the Full Court in matter number 376 of 2006 ..." 
 

A submission to like effect had been made to me when the Registrar sought directions on 6 October 2006. I rejected the submissions for reasons which I gave in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 5) [2006] FCA 1340 at [5] . Proceeding number 376 of 2006 was the file number assigned to Mr Siminton's appeal from the finding and orders of Merkel J. Proceeding number 1607 of 2005 is the file number assigned to the principal proceeding in which the ex parte orders of Sundberg J were made. In my view Order 2(c) of the Full Court's orders empowered the District Registrar to make application to a single judge of the Court. It did not require her to make application to a member of the Full Court. It was appropriate for her to seek such directions by resort to a notice of motion filed in the principal proceeding. This is what she did.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1608">27 I refused Mr Siminton's application. Similar strike-out applications had been made to Merkel J on 30 March 2006 and to me on 18 October 2006. Those applications had been supported by substantially the same arguments and, in both cases had been rejected: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 2) [2006] FCA 336 ; Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 5) [2006] FCA 1340. There was no substance to the argument advanced in support of the permanent stay applications when they were first made. It was not improved by repetition.
