<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1625">The third respondent closed his case shortly after 11.30 am on 19 April 2007. The applicants did not have any case in reply. When the second respondent was excused from giving further evidence on 13 April 2007 (see National Auto Glass Supplies (Australia) Pty Limited v Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass (NSW) Pty Limited (No 5) [2007] FCA 569) an order was made, on the applicants' application, that no further use may be made of any part of the affidavit or oral evidence of the second respondent (see National Auto Glass Supplies (Australia) Pty Limited v Nielsen &amp; Moller Autoglass (NSW) Pty Limited (No 7) [2007] FCA 582). At times during the course of the hearing each of the second and third respondents made remarks which manifest a degree of bitterness about the predicament in which the first respondent found itself and which they attributed to the applicants' conduct. They undoubtedly had a sense of grievance that the first applicant had not been competing with the first respondent on a level playing field.</sentence>
