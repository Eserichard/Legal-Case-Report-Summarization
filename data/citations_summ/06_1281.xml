<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1528">19 Furthermore it is accepted by this Court that the doctrine of procedural fairness is applicable to decisions made by the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (cf Employers First v Tolhurst Capital Ltd [2005] FCA 616 ; (2005) 143 FCR 356 and Auspine Staff Superannuation Pty Ltd v Henderson [2006] FCA 1281). So, for example, in Employers First Branson J said at [69]:
 The obligation on the Tribunal to afford procedural fairness to the parties to a review means that it may not make a determination adverse to the interests of a party to that review without giving that party a reasonable opportunity to make written submissions to the Tribunal on the approach that the Tribunal is contemplating. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] SCTA 46">In Auspine Staff Superannuation Pty Limited v Henderson [2006] FCA 1281 [26 October 2006], the Federal Court considered a definition of total and permanent disablement which stated that the insured came within the definition if the disablement occurs whilst the insured is in the active service of the relevant employer and the disablement results from an illness, action or injury and results in the insured being continuously absent from his or her employment for at least 6 consecutive months and AMP [the insurer] has determined that it is unlikely that the insured will ever be able to engage in any regular remunerative work for which he is reasonably fitted by education, training or experience. The definition under consideration in that case and the definition in the policy in this complaint are not the same but are similar in that both require, that, in the opinion of the insurer, it is unlikely that the insured will ever engage in an occupation. In the policy, the occupation that the insured must be unable to engage in is their own occupation or a similar occupation which they are reasonably capable of performing by reason of education, training or experience. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] SCTA 42">However, in a Federal Court decision some 10 months earlier, which was not referred to in Halloran , a different conclusion was reached in relation to a similar definition. That case was Auspine Staff Superannuation Pty Ltd v Henderson [2006] FCA 1281 (26 October 2006), in which it was decided that the Insurer's decision had to be based on the Insured's circumstances at the time the Insurer was making the decision. Similar conclusions appear to have been reached in Oberlechner v Watson Wyatt Superannuation Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 906 (16 August 2007) and Samaras v Australian Retirement Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1323 (31 August 2007).
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1323">35 In general terms, Mr Samaras contended that it was unnecessary for him to identify an illness or illnesses attached to his period of employment with the ATC and that the question for the Insurer and the Trustee was whether, at the time of their respective decisions, there was any illness or illnesses that cumulatively resulted in Mr Samaras being unlikely to ever be able to engage in any regular remunerative work for which he was reasonably fitted by education, training or experience. Mr Samaras sought to support his construction of the definition by reference to the decision of Jessup J in Auspine Staff Superannuation Pty Ltd v Henderson [2006] FCA 1281 ; (2007) 14 ANZ Insurance Cases 90-127 at [63] and [64]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 1533">1 On 26 October 2006, I gave judgment in this matter: Auspine Staff Superannuation Pty Ltd v Henderson [2006] FCA 1281. I gave the parties leave to file written submissions on the question of costs. They have now done so. In the reasons which follow, I deal with those aspects of the parties' submissions which I regard as raising serious questions about the appropriateness of my adopting the conventional course that costs should follow the event.</sentence>
