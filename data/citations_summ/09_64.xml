<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 212">This is an application by way of notice of motion to set aside the orders I made on 9 February 2009, in which I dismissed the appeal of the applicant on the motion against a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court. I gave reasons for my decision to dismiss the appeal ( SZHWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 64). Those reasons record that when the matter was called for hearing, the applicant did not appear. On the basis of the information made available to me at that time, I was satisfied that the appeal should be dismissed by reason of the applicant's failure to appear. I was also satisfied that, in any event, the documents relating to the appeal did not disclose any jurisdictional error. I provided reasons for this conclusion in paragraphs 3 to 11 of my decision. </sentence>
