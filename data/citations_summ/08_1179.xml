<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 594">After I formed the above view and informed the parties, Mr Priestley, in effect, sought leave to reopen his applications for leave to appeal in order to raise further matters as to why leave should be granted. He raised matters that were the subject of previous decisions by me in relation to the alleged invalidity of s 31A of the Federal Court Act and O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules ( Priestley v Godwin (No 3) [2008] FCA 1529 ; (2008) 172 FCR 139) and in relation to the applicability of the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT) ( Priestley v Godwin (No 2) [2008] FCA 1453 ; (2008) 171 FCR 493). He also raised allegations, unsupported by evidence, of what he termed bias and jurisdictional error. I dealt with Mr Priestley's allegations of bias in Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 1179. Those allegations were also the subject of an application to the High Court and were described by French CJ as ' not tenable ' ( Priestley v Godwin (Parliamentary Service Merit Protection Commissioner) [2008] HCA 59 ; (2008) 251 ALR 612 at [31] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 303">As Counsel for the Respondents submitted, not only did JL Holdings not support the granting of the adjournment in the circumstances of the present proceeding but there is a vast body of authority in this Court where applications for adjournments have been refused where the Applicant for the adjournment was in a far better position than the current Applicant: for example, in Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 102 at [13] - [20] per Finkelstein J (giving the judgment of the Court on the grounds of the application) an application for adjournment was refused where there was evidence of lack of funds and lack of necessary documentation to prosecute the appeal. See also AMI Australia Holdings Pty Ltd v Bade Medical Institute (Aust) Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1783 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1628 ; Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd v Elderslie Finance Corporation Ltd [2008] FCA 1045 ; Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 1179 ; Vescio v Hon Kristina Keneally [2008] FCA 589 ; Westpac Banking Corporation v Tsatsoulis [2003] FCA 406. By way of contrast, an adjournment was granted in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 920 , where substantial evidence was led that thousands of pages of documents were provided to the Applicant on the eve of the trial as annexures to affidavits in circumstances where the Applicant could not reasonably have read these documents or be certain that relevant discovery had been completed. That is a long way removed from this case: see [22] to [26] above. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] HCA 59">On 16 July 2008, Bennett J refused Mr Priestley's application for an adjournment [2] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1453">3 As set out in Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 1179 , Mr Priestley made a number of applications for me to disqualify myself from determining the constitutional challenge. I refused to disqualify myself on three of the grounds advanced by Mr Priestley. I reserved my decision in respect of a fourth ground based on the contention that, by s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ('the Judiciary Act '), the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT) ('the Human Rights Act ') applies to these proceedings, being heard in the Australian Capital Territory ('the ACT') ('the fourth ground').
