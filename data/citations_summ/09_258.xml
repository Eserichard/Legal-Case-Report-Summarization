<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 49">110 Briefly, the reasons why I would do so are as follows. Three of the four circumstances which were said to combine together to sustain a reasonable apprehension of bias were dealt with by the primary judge in an interlocutory judgment made necessary because Lanepoint belatedly asked him to disqualify himself as judgment was about to be delivered. He concluded that Lanepoint had waived any right to rely upon the matters it sought to raise and that, in any event, they provided no foundation for the application which it made ( Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 258). I can see no error in the way in which the primary judge dealt with the contentions which were there raised. 78 This application arose in the following circumstances. After the conclusion of the hearing before the primary judge, and shortly before the primary judge handed down his judgment, Lanepoint brought an application that the primary judge disqualify himself on the grounds of apprehended bias. Lanepoint relied on three prior associations affecting the primary judge and Mr Carey and his associated companies, as giving rise to the apprehension of bias. The primary judge refused to disqualify himself ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 258). The amended grounds of appeal referred to the three associations that were considered by the primary judge in that judgment, and then added a further association between the primary judge and Mr Norman Carey which, contended Lanepoint, added weight to its contention that these associations, when considered cumulatively, gave rise to an apprehension of bias on the part of the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 510">The legal principles with respect to the disqualification of a Federal Magistrate for apprehended bias are firmly established and may be summarised as follows: the test is whether a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the Federal Magistrate might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question required to be decided; [96] the application of the test requires two steps: the identification of what it is said might lead a Federal Magistrate to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits; and an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits; [97] the fair minded lay observer is a person who is: informed, objective, and taken to be reasonable; [98] not assumed to have a detailed knowledge of the law or the character or ability of a particular Federal Magistrate, but rather a general knowledge of ordinary judicial practice and the actual circumstances of the case; [99] the Federal Magistrate being observed is a professional judicial officer who by training, tradition and oath or affirmation is required to discard the irrelevant, immaterial and prejudicial; [100] a Federal Magistrate's duty is to hear and determine the litigation before the Court, and not to accede too readily to suggestions of an apprehension of bias, lest parties be encouraged to seek such disqualification without justification; [101] disqualification is only made out by firmly establishing that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias by reason of prejudgment, that is that the Federal Magistrate's mind is so prejudiced in favour of a conclusion already formed that it is not susceptible to alteration of that conclusion irrespective of the evidence or arguments presented; [102] and comments made by a federal magistrate must be considered in the context in which they are made, including the context of: ordinary judicial practice; the exigencies of modern litigation.
