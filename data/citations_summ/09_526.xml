<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 211">In making the broad assessment of merit the Court has had regard to the fact that a decision of the Tribunal is only liable to be set aside upon review if it involves jurisdictional error. [15] An error by an administrative tribunal such as the Tribunal, will only constitute jurisdictional error if the Tribunal: identifies a wrong issue; asks a wrong question; ignores relevant material; or relies on irrelevant material, 
in such a way that the Tribunal's exercise or purported exercise of power is thereby affected, resulting in a decision exceeding or failing to exercise the authority or powers given under the relevant statute. [16]

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1075">In making that broad assessment of merit the Court has regard to the fact that a decision of the Tribunal is only liable to be set aside upon review if it involves jurisdictional error. [32] An error by an administrative tribunal, such as the Tribunal, will only constitute jurisdictional error if the Tribunal: identifies a wrong issue; asks the wrong question; ignores relevant material; or relies on irrelevant material, 
in such a way that the Tribunal's exercise or purported exercise of power is thereby affected resulting in a decision exceeding or failing to exercise the authority or powers given under the relevant statute. [33] Therefore, a factual finding of the Tribunal going to the merits of the application is not capable of being set aside as jurisdictional error. [34] Thus, a Tribunal decision turning entirely on assessment of an applicant's credibility will not be open to challenge because it amounts to "an impermissible attempt to undertake further merits review.
