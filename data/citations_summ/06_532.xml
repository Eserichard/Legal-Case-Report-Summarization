<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] AATA 611">Reference was also made in Willis supra to the decision of Bennett J in Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Brown (2006) FCA 532.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] AATA 940">In written submissions, counsel for Mr Willis urged a different approach. The submissions pointed out s 541B(1)(a)(i) refers to a person being "enrolled in a course of education at an educational institution" rather than being "enrolled in subjects offered which form part of a course of education at an educational institution. " In making those submissions, counsel is using the expressions differently to the way they are used in the University of Queensland's rules. The language used by counsel is reminiscent of the usage adopted by Bennett J in Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Brown [2006] FCA 532 ; (2006) 155 FCR 296. In that case, her Honour accepted (at [22]): 
 "the course" refers to the "course of education", that is to the degree as a whole, not just to a subject. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] AATA 1918">I was referred to a number of the leading authorities that describe the correct approach to the interpretation of the rules, including Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355. Those authorities point out the decision-maker's job is to give effect to the intention of the parliament: see, for example, Project Blue Sky at 384 per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. The first and best guide to the parliament's intentions are the words of the statute itself: see Sussex Peerage Case [1844] EngR 822 ; (1844) 11 Cl &amp; F 85 (8 ER 1034 at 1057), cited by Gaudron J in Thompson v Judge Byrne [1999] HCA 16 ; (1999) 196 CLR 141 at 159. But those words cannot be read in isolation. As Bennett J explained in Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Brown [2006] FCA 532 , a statutory provision must be "construed in its context, so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute". Her Honour added that "context or purpose can thus justify a court in giving a 'strained construction' to cure the mischief the provision was intended to cure or to achieve its clear legislative purpose": at [24]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] AATA 1450">Mr Colborne relied on the Secretary Department of Family and Community Services v Brown [2006] FCA 532 at paragraphs 21 to 27. I just briefly refer to that decision. The quotation upon which he relies begins at paragraph 21: 
 The Court may construe words in a statute so as to operate in a particular way, even if the words used would not on a literal construction, so operate. However, the words which actually appear in that statute must be reasonably open to such a construction. As Spigelman CJ in R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 166 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 681 at 687 said --- 
 
And then there is a quotation from the Chief Justice. Then he quotes paragraph 24:
 
 A particular statutory provision is construed in its context, so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] AIRC 654"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] AATA 665">A purposive approach to statutory interpretation vis a vis strict adherence to the words of the statute was discussed by Bennett J in Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Brown [2006] FCA 532 commencing at paragraph 23: 
 
 "Mr Smith submits that the 'modern approach to construction of statutes' requires that regard be had to the purpose of the statute or section, which is ascertained by having regard not only to the grammatical meaning of the words but also to the broad context.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] AATA 563">As pointed out by Bennett J in Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Brown [2006] FCA 532 at [21] , courts may construe words in a statute so as to operate in a particular way, even if the words used would not, on a literal construction, so operate, but the words which actually appear in the statute must be reasonably open to such a construction.</sentence>
