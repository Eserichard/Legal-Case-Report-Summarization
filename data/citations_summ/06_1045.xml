<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 944">There can be no doubt the Tribunal clearly had the power to proceed under s 426A(1) in the appellant's absence. While that power must be exercised reasonably and cannot be exercised capriciously, the election to proceed to a decision on the review in the absence of the appellant cannot, by itself, be treated as the expression of an unreasonable exercise of the power: NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 152 FCR 592 ; [2006] FCA 1045 per Greenwood J at [20]---[21].

I accept the submission by Ms Rayment that the Applicant has made no meaningful attempt to identify jurisdictional error in the Tribunal decision and none is apparent. It is the Tribunal's power to proceed under s.426A(1) , as it did in this case, and this is available to it even if circumstances are shown which would otherwise show a failure of procedural fairness: VNAA &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ( [2004] FCAFC 134 ; 2004) 136 FCR 407 at [14] --- [15] ; SZDPB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 110 at [17] ; and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC [2006] FCAFC 73 at [39] . Although the power conferred by s.426A must be exercised reasonably and cannot be exercised capriciously, the election to make a distinction on the review is not, by itself, the expression of an unreasonable exercise of the power: NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 per Greenwood J at [20] --- [21]. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] FMCA 297">I am not satisfied that the Tribunal lacked the power to proceed under s.426A(1) , nor that its discretion to follow that course is shown to have miscarried in point of jurisdiction. It is well established that the Tribunal may exercise validly the power to complete its review under s.426A(1) , even where the Court is satisfied that, in fact, the applicant did not receive a hearing invitation, whether because of his or her own fault or the fault of another person (see VNAA v Minister for Immigration (2004) 136 FCR 407 at [14]- [15], Kim v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 64 , NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 ; (2006) 152 FCR 592 , and SZDPB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 110 at [17] ). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 364">Later in that same decision, the Full Court held at [63]: It is plain enough, in the light of Dranichnikov , that a failure by the Tribunal to deal with a claim raised by the evidence and the contentions before it which, if resolved in one way, would or could be dispositive of the review, can constitute a failure of procedural fairness or a failure to conduct the review required by the Act. In conclusion, counsel for the applicant submitted that, by failing to attach weight to these pieces of evidence, the Tribunal had failed to deal with a relevant issue, indeed the applicant's core claim, which had been sufficiently raised. The First Respondent's Submissions 
 The solicitor for the Minister, Ms Dinihan, submitted that the Tribunal, in taking the actions that it did in inviting the applicant to attend a hearing, was entitled to make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it, under s.426A of the Migration Act : NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [53] at [5]; NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [54] at [20]. As to the Tribunal's decision to place no weight on the record of the airport interview, the applicant had objected to the interview being recorded [55] and did not agree that the record of the interview fully reflected the claims that he wished to make in Australia. He did this by not signing the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 275">As I said to the applicant this morning, where the Tribunal has complied with all of the requirements relevantly set out in the Act it is not obliged to make any further enquiries as to why the applicant did not appear before it. It is not obliged, once having complied with the procedural fairness requirements set out in the Act, to make any further attempt prior to the hearing to notify the applicant of the hearing date. For relevant authority on this proposition I refer to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC [2006] FCAFC 73 ; (2006) 150 FCR 439 at [39] , [41] per Spender, French and Cowdroy JJ, NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 ; (2006) 152 FCR 592 at [20] - [22], per Greenwood J (special leave to appeal refused: NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCATrans 511 , per Hayne and Crennan JJ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FMCA 294">No response to the invitation was received by the Tribunal. In those circumstances under s.426A of the Act, as the applicant was invited to appear and did not appear on the day, time and place scheduled, the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it (see NAVX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287 and NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 ; (2006) 152 FCR 592 at [20]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FMCA 186">Accordingly, the applicant is deemed to have received the invitation within seven working days of the day in which it was sent (see subsections 441C(4) and 441G of the Act). The invitation gave the applicant 14 days notice in accordance with s.425A of the Act and reg.4.35D of the Migration Regulations. The Tribunal, it is submitted by the Minister, and I believe correctly, was entitled to proceed under s.426A of the Act without making a further inquiry [10] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FCA 1789">35 In my view, the Tribunal's decision to proceed under s 426A was not capricious, nor did it fail to take into account the material submitted to it: see NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 ; (2006) 152 FCR 592 , 598 at [21]. I do not regard it as incumbent on the Tribunal in this case to inform the appellant of the reason for not rescheduling the hearing, or allowing the appellant the opportunity to present argument on whether the Tribunal should proceed under s 426A , prior to the Tribunal so deciding.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FMCA 1500">The Tribunal then proceeded to make a decision as, in my opinion, it was clearly authorised to do under s.426A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). It is well established that the Tribunal was not obliged to make inquiries into the reason for the applicant not being in attendance (see NBBL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 ; (2006) 152 FCR 592). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FMCA 1350">It is well established that an applicant must advance his own case and whatever evidence or argument he wishes to advance in support of his claims and that it is for the Tribunal to then decide whether that claim is made out (see Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [187] per Gummow and Hayne JJ). This is not a case in which the circumstances are such as to indicate that the Tribunal was under any obligation to undertake its own inquiries or to seek further information (see NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 ; (2006) 152 FCR 592). The first ground is not made out. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FMCA 1049">Nonetheless, as conceded by the first respondent, it is necessary to have regard to the manner in which the Tribunal exercised its power under s.426A. As Greenwood J stated in NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 ; (2006) 152 FCR 592 at [21] : ... the power conferred upon the Tribunal cannot be exercised capriciously and must be exercised reasonably, the election to make a decision on the review is not, by itself, the expression of an unreasonable exercise of the power. It is expressly contemplated by the section. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] FMCA 840"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FMCA 694">There was nothing from the applicants to seek an adjournment of the hearing date, nor did the applicants seek any further opportunity. Further, I cannot see that there was any obligation on the Tribunal to make any enquiry as to the failure of the applicants to appear at the scheduled hearing (see in particular NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 152 FCR 592 ; [2006] FCA 1045 at [20] - [22]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FMCA 265">The Tribunal, to my mind, has complied with the requirements of s.425 of the Migration Act by inviting the applicants to attend the hearing. The letters were sent by registered post, admittedly to two different addresses, both of which the applicant had given. In each case the letter was sent more than the required period of time prior to the hearing, and therefore complies with ss.425A , 426 (1) and 441A of the Act. I am of a view that the Tribunal was entitled to proceed under s.426A of the Migration Act and was, as counsel for the Minister points out, under no obligation to make further inquiries as to the applicant's failure to attend the hearing. I am referred to the decision of NBBL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [3] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2007] FCA 1613">28 The first respondent also submits that, having regard to the construction placed upon s 426A by Greenwood J in NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 , where the matters set out under s 426A(1)(a) and (b) are satisfied, the Tribunal's discretion whether to make a decision without a further hearing is constrained only by the requirement that it not act capriciously and that in this case the Tribunal did not so act. 
  31 There are related questions as to whether the discretion miscarried because the Tribunal misdirected itself: NBGZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 119 at [52] - [56] per Allsop J, or failed to consider relevant material: NBBL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 at [21] and [24], the result of which was that the appellant was denied procedural fairness. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2007] FMCA 67">However, even assuming that he could establish that as a matter of fact, this would not provide any arguable jurisdictional error since it is well-established that in circumstances such as the present the Tribunal is entitled to rely upon the proper despatch of its invitation to the applicant's nominated address for correspondence (see VNAA &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 134 ; (2004) 136 FCR 407 at [14] - [15], and NBBL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045).</sentence>

<sentence id="cs23" from="[2006] FCA 2009">Whether a court of appeal may find it expedient in the interests of justice to entertain a point not previously raised involves consideration of issues including: &#8226; where there is a question of law upon the construction of a document or upon facts either admitted or proved beyond controversy, in contrast with the situation where a plea cannot be disposed of without deciding questions of fact (where a court of appeal is in a much less advantageous position than the courts below) ( Connecticut Fire Insurance Co v Kavanagh [1892] AC 473 at 480, Mason J in O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 at 319, Suttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd [1950] HCA 35 ; (1950) 81 CLR 418 at 438 and Green v Sommerville [1979] HCA 60 ; (1979) 141 CLR 594 at 608) &#8226; the importance of avoiding the repetition of similar mistakes of law in the future ( Crampton v R (2000) 206 CLR 161 at 236, Giannarelli v R [1983] HCA 41 ; (1983) 154 CLR 212) &#8226; taking into consideration the discipline required of parties in the conduct of a case (Greenwood J in NBBL v MIMIA [2006] FCA 1045 at [12] ) &#8226; whether it is clear that the appellant does not seek to overturn the primary judgment because of any error in it, but is appealing on the basis that the primary judgment should simply be put to one side and ignored (Gyles J in Iyer v MIMIA [2001] FCA 929 at [61] ) &#8226; whether the new grounds are short, direct issues of which the respondent has had notice and which do not unduly prolong the hearing of the appeal ( Gomez v MIMIA (2002) 190 ALR 543 at 549) &#8226; whether the appellant had the benefit of legal representation at the primary hearing ( Iyer v MIMIA [2000] FCA 1788 at [24] ) &#8226; the merits of the grounds raised. This was explained by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Iyer v MIMIA [2000] FCA 1788 at [24] in the following terms: 
 
 
 'However, in order to determine whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice that leave be given to argue new grounds it is necessary to give some consideration to the merits of the grounds raised. That does not mean that an appellate court should enter upon a full consideration of the grounds. To do so would make the requirement for leave meaningless. It is sufficient to determine whether the grounds sought to be raised have a reasonable prospect of success. ' 
 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2006] FCA 1295">I am fortified in this construction of s 426A by a decision of Greenwood J in NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 , especially at [24]. The matter may also be tested by considering whether, if the Tribunal had decided to make attempts to contact the appellant on her failure to attend on 21 March 2001, the Minister could have attacked that conduct on the ground that a jurisdictional error occurred. In my opinion it could not. </sentence>
