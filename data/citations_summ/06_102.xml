There was no dispute that s 449E(1)(a) of the Corporations Act permits the remuneration of a deed administrator to be determined prospectively at a meeting of creditors that resolves to adopt a DOCA: Re Gidley [2006] FCA 102 ; 150 FCR 345 (Gyles J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 1222">


 
6 It was at this meeting of creditors held on 1 April 2008 that creditors resolved to execute the deed of company arrangement that was ultimately executed on 21 April 2008 (it may be accepted that remuneration of a deed administrator may be determined prospectively by the meeting of creditors that resolves to adopt the deed of company arrangement: Gidley re Aliance Motor Body Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 102 ; (2006) 150 FCR 345) .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 515">The considerations referred to in the above passage are essential to the presence of a matter and therefore the jurisdiction of this Court under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act (see also Mentha v GE Capital Ltd (1997) 154 ALR 565 at 574 per Finkelstein J; Re Gidley [2006] FCA 102 ; (2006) 150 FCR 345 ; Purchas v Estore Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 1222 ; (2006) 154 FCR 246). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] VSC 170">114 In Re Aliance Motor Body Pty Ltd (" Re Aliance "), [67] Gyles J, in a "test" case, held that in many cases, the remuneration of an administrator of a DOCA could be fixed prospectively by reference to a formula based on time. In Re Aliance , the relevant resolutions provided: 
 
 
 
 "1. Remuneration of Administrators 
 That the remuneration of the Joint and Several Administrators his partners and staff, for the period 20 June 2005 to the (sic) 15 July 2005, be approved on a time basis in accordance with Lawler Partners guide to hourly rates in the amount of $34,703 plus GST in the amount of $3,470.30.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 1222">Notice of the proceeding has been given to the interested creditors and none appears to oppose the grant of relief. However, there are no other parties to the proceedings. In particular, there are no parties representing the different interests involved. There is no contradictor. In my opinion, the proceeding is not constituted appropriately for the making of a declaration of right. The limits of the exercise of that jurisdiction in circumstances such as the present have been explained in Mentha v GE Capital Limited (1997) 154 ALR 565 at 571---575 (cf Gidley Re Aliance Motor Body Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 102 ; (2006) 150 FCR 345 at 347; Shepard v Sports Mondial of Australia Pty Ltd (in liq) (2005) 53 ACSR 746 , [2005] NSWSC 432 at [18] ---[19]). However, those authorities establish that it is appropriate that the liquidators be given directions pursuant to s 511 of the Act as to the manner in which they can act in relation to the Administration Fund. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 1201">In the alternative, it is submitted that I should make an order pursuant to s 447A that Pt 5.3A of the Act is to operate in relation to Huon so that liabilities incurred pursuant to cl 6 should be deemed to have been debts incurred pursuant to s 443A for services rendered. Such an order has substantive effect compared with the giving of directions (cf Gidley Re Aliance Motor Body Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 102 ; (2006) 150 FCR 345 at [3] ---[4]). Because of this, it is necessary to ensure that notice has been given to those affected. On the other hand, the application is not a lis between parties or adversary litigation.</sentence>
