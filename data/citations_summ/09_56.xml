<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 484">The principal orders sought by the plaintiffs in the Amended Notice of Motion were that certain judgments I had given in favour of the third defendant and the fourth defendant respectively, pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), be set aside. My reasons for giving the judgments are set out in Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 56 ('Keynes (No 2)') ; [2009] FCA 567 ; 72 ACSR 264. The plaintiffs sought leave to appeal from my decision in Keynes (No 2) and the Full Court of this Court granted leave but dismissed the appeal: Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd [2010] FCAFC 100 ; [2010] FCAFC 100 ; (2010) 186 FCR 281. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] WASC 4">64 Again, the point is made clear by referring to Australian Fisheries Management v Mei Ying Su [2009] FCA 56 ; (2009) 255 ALR 454 , where the Full Court of the Federal Court, distinguishing Ostrowski , held that a foreign fisherman who honestly and reasonably believed that a red line marked on his GPS navigation unit represented the border of the Australian Fishing Zone made a mistake of fact and not law, which negated his criminal responsibility for fishing within that zone. Captain Su's mistake was held to be a mistake about where he was and whether he was in the zone. Mr Palmer was under no mistaken belief as to where he was. His mistake was about whether he was entitled to fish there lawfully.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] WASC 37">43 In the recent case of Australian Fisheries Management Authority v Mei Ying Su [2009] FCA 56 ; (2009) 255 ALR 454 the Full Court of the Federal Court held that a foreign fisherman who honestly and reasonably believed that a red line marked on his GPS navigation unit represented the border of the Australian Fishing Zone made a mistake of fact and not law. The Full Court distinguished Ostrowski v Palmer saying that the mistake was as to the character of the line on the GPS which gave rise to a mistake as to the position of the vessel in relation to the fishing zone. This was a mistake as to a fact relevant to one of the elements of the offence namely whether or not the vessel was within the fishing zone. In some respects it is difficult to reconcile this decision with Ostrowski v Palmer since the border of the fishing zone would appear on its face to be a matter of law and a mistake as to the location of that border would be a mistake of law. However, the Full Federal Court characterised the mistake in that case as one of a mistake as to the location of the vessel in relation to the border.</sentence>
