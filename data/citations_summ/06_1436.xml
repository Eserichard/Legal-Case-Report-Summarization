<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 546">In Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 ; (2006) 93 ALD 107 , at 114 [35], Finn J said that the requirement for a clinical worsening "imposed a medical-scientific standard, not a lay standard", emphasising, at 115 [47]: 
 
 ... Whether there has been a clinical worsening of a particular depressive disorder ... was a diagnostic question that addressed the features and symptoms of that disorder as defined in the SoP and required a clinical judgment be made. 
 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] AATA 336">The Instruments of 2007 and 2008 do not contain factors concerning the clinical worsening of dysthymic disorder but there is such a provision within Instrument No 58 of 1998. If it were to apply, the applicant would be permitted to have considered whether he experienced a severe psychosocial stressor or stressors within two years before the clinical worsening of dysthymia. Clinical worsening is not determined by an increase in symptoms alone but regard must be given to clinical criteria and therefore upon a medical --- scientific standard ( Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 ; (2006) 93 ALD 107 at [29] , [33] and [35]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 1042">The leading case on this point is the Federal Court's decision in Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 ; (2006) 93 ALD 107. That case considered whether there had been a clinical worsening of an alcohol abuse condition. Finn J said it was not enough for the Tribunal to find the applicant was drinking more heavily after a particular event. His Honour said the Tribunal must refer back to the diagnostic criteria in the SoP when it was considering whether there was a clinical worsening of the condition. Mr Stoner questioned whether there was enough evidence before me to reach a view that there had been a clinical worsening in that sense. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] AATA 298">Clinical worsening is not determined only by an examination of the quantities of alcohol consumed or a finding that there was an increase in the alcohol consumed. A finding of clinical worsening is a medical issue directed at satisfaction of the diagnostic or definitional criteria. Clinical worsening must be of the disease having the features, symptoms and manifestations prescribed in the definition within the SoP (refer Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 at [33] ). Finn J, at [34] also decided that the worsening is in the clinically significant impairment or distress which resulted from the maladaptive pattern of alcohol abuse and which, importantly for these proceedings, was manifested in one or more of the prescribed ways within a 12 month period. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] AATA 23">Finn J in Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 referred to the issue of clinical worsening in the following terms, viz: 
 "...The Tribunal misconstrued what was comprehended by the clinical worsening requirement of par 5 (d) of the SOP. That requirement imposed a medical-scientific standard, not a lay standard. Though the Tribunal found a clinical worsening of Mr Milenz's alcohol abuse it did not address whether there was a worsening in the disease as defined and manifest...".

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] AATA 870">The respondent's advocate, Mr Kelly, referred to the applicant's failure to mention the fuel tanker incident for some years, including at the earlier Tribunal hearing in 2004. He stated that despite the applicant's submission that the 1975 fuel tanker incident was a stressful and life threatening event, he did not mention it to either his doctors or psychiatrists until 2007 (when he told Dr Anderson). On that basis, Mr Kelly submitted, the applicant's actions during and after the incident indicated that it did not have the claimed effect on him. Mr Kelly submitted that the incident was not a category 1A stressor or a life threatening event as maintained by the applicant. Mr Kelly noted that although Dr Anderson had said that the fuel tanker incident aggravated pre-existing conditions of depressive disorder, alcohol dependence and PTSD, no examples of how this might have occurred were given. Mr Kelly submitted that the applicant's submissions failed in accordance with the principles referred to in Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 ; (2006) 93 ALD 107. In relation to alcohol abuse, Mr Kelly reminded the Tribunal that the applicant had given evidence of his heavy drinking since 1968. In conclusion, Mr Kelly referred to Mansfield J's statement in Stoddart v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCA 334 ; (2003) 74 ALD 366 at 378 [50] : "I do not think it [the definition of 'severe stressor'] provides for idiosyncratic and personal perceptions of events which, judged objectively, do not fall within the adjectival clause. "

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] AATA 89">That factor must be pointed to by the evidence before the necessary connection with relevant service can be said to exist. It applies only to a material contribution to or aggravation of, alcohol abuse in circumstances where the condition of alcohol abuse "... was suffered or contracted before or during (but not arising out of) the person's relevant service". So much is made clear by paragraph 7 of the SOP. It must be assessed according to a medical scientific standard (not a lay standard) and there must be evidence of a clinical worsening of the disease as defined in the SOP. In other words, there must be evidence of "...clinically significant impairment or distress" as manifested by at least three of the factors shown in the definition ( Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 ; (2006) 93 ALD 107). I accept there is a clinical worsening of the condition as defined in the SOP and based on Dr Rees' diagnosis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] AATA 1099">Relevant case law makes plain, that "clinical onset" and "clinical worsening" are medical issues, requiring diagnostic judgement [18] . The terms refer to the time at which a person's constellation of symptoms is such that a medical practitioner would have diagnosed the particular disease as present or as having worsened [19] . Recent Federal Court decisions emphasise the importance of differentiating the exact nature of the medical condition in issue [20] . There is a tendency with alcohol abuse and dependence to ignore the difference between the two diagnoses.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] AATA 1032">In those circumstances, it is necessary to identify material suggesting there was an aggravation or clinical worsening of the pre-existing PTSD condition as a result of what occurred during operational service. The expression "aggravation" is reasonably well-known: it means more grave, more grievous or more serious in its effects: Federal Broom Co Pty Ltd v Semlitch [1964] HCA 34 ; (1964) 110 CLR 626 at 639 per Windeyer J. But as Mr Stoner pointed out, it is not enough to say the condition looked worse, or that the applicant felt worse in some general sense. The Federal Court explained in Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 ; (2006) 93 ALD 107 at [29] , [35] that there must be a worsening having regard to the diagnostic criteria set out in the relevant statement of principles. Those criteria set out a medical-scientific standard rather than a lay person's standard. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1614">30 In relation to Ground 3.2, s 5D(1)(a) of the VE Act defines a "disease" as "any physical or mental ailment, disorder, defect or morbid condition (whether of sudden onset or gradual development)". The Commission submitted that whether or not a person suffers from a disease, the time of clinical onset of a disease, and whether or not there has been a clinical worsening of a disease are all matters susceptible of being answered only by an expression of medical opinion; see Repatriation Committee v Cooke (1998) 90 FCR 307 at 312; Repatriation Commission v Cornelius [2002] FCA 50 at [26] ; Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 at [33] - [35].</sentence>

The parties agreed the relevant statement of principles is that relating to generalised anxiety disorder (No 102 of 2007). Mr Stoner, for the respondent, conceded the statement of principles in relation to depression (No 18 of 2007) was also formally relevant. We understand it was accepted by both parties that the applicant's claim would stand or fall on the strength of the anxiety statement of principles. Mr Stoner also pointed out there was an accrued right to be considered under the earlier statement of principles if the applicant was unsuccessful under the most recent iteration. The parties nonetheless agreed that it would be unnecessary to go that far since the most recent statements of principles were more generous from the applicant's point of view. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] AATA 78">The phrase "clinical worsening" (within the meaning, and for the purposes, of the various SoPs in which it appears) has recently been considered by the Federal Court of Australia. In Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 ; (2006) 93 ALD 107 Finn J said (at 113-114): 
 " [33] The question whether a disease as defined in a SoP has clinically worsened is a medical one, raising as it does a diagnostic question. I have emphasised 'as defined' for the reason that the clinical worsening must be of the disease having the features, symptoms and manifestations prescribed in the relevant SoP's definition ..." (original emphasis)
 
 
Later (at 115-116) his Honour commented that the question whether there has been a "clinical worsening" of a particular disease is 
 
 "a diagnostic question that addresse(s) the features and symptoms of that [disease] as defined in the SoP and require(s) [that] a clinical judgment be made".

<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] AATA 1640">"Clinical worsening" is not defined in any of the relevant SoPs, however the meaning of that term was addressed by Deputy President McMahon in Re A'Bell and Repatriation [1999] AATA 739 ; (1999) 58 ALD 721. DP McMahon, after consideration of various authorities, made the point that in all cases, "distinctions have been drawn between temporary worsening of symptoms and aggravation as a compensable concept". Aggravation is not necessarily indicated by a temporary worsening of symptoms with consequential temporary incapacity. The question to be determined is whether the pre-existing condition itself has been worsened. Further, in Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 ; (2006) 93 ALD 107 Finn J defines the term "clinical worsening" as the presence of signs and symptoms which would permit a clinician to conclude that the signs and symptoms of the primary condition, as prescribed by the SoP, have been made worse. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2007] FCA 1087">36 I accept the contentions of the Commission that in determining whether that factor existed, it was necessary for the Tribunal:
 
(1) to distinguish between the two disorders; and 
 
(2) to have before it (and it appears that it did not) evidence from a medical practitioner determining for the purposes of the Alcohol SoP whether the disease is or was present at a particular time: Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 ; (2006) 93 ALD 107 at [34] citing Repatriation Commission v Cornelius [2002] FCA 750 at [26] . The latter requirement imposed a medical-scientific standard, not a lay standard, which in the present case required evidence from a medical practitioner identifying the date of the clinical onset of the disease the veteran had contracted within two years from October 1970 (being the date of a helicopter incident in Vietnam). Moreover, such a diagnosis would have to take into account the criteria prescribed by the Alcohol SoP for each relevant disorder --- alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2007] AATA 1608">The term "clinical worsening" was explained by Finn J in Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 to require a clinical judgement as to whether there had been a worsening of the features and symptoms of the disorder as defined. We note that Finn J refers to the disorder as defined in the SoP, but following the decision of Keifel J in Repatriation Commission v Warren [2007] FCA 866 ; the reference must be to the disorder as either defined in the SoP or the appropriate diagnostic text. For example for Psychiatric Disorders the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2007] AATA 1422">It is not fanciful or untenable nor is it contrary to known scientific evidence. The evidence is also consistent with the definitions of "death from subarachnoid haemorrhage" or "death from cerebrovascular accident" and with the factors outlined in the relevant SoPs. The hypothesis is based on this evidence and is consistent with the manifestations required under the SoPs ( Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 ; (2006) 93 ALD 107). We are therefore satisfied that there is also a causal connection and that the raised facts in the evidence are consistent with the templates contained in the relevant SoPs and therefore create a reasonable hypothesis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2007] AATA 1284">We should at this point comment on the aspects of clinical onset and clinical worsening in the context of the evidence as a whole. Both are matters that require the exercise of clinical judgement by medical practitioners, a point more recently highlighted by the Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v Milenz . [35] In matters of this kind it will be usual that the event took place some time ago, and the evidence will rarely be available that would enable exact findings on the clinical onset or clinical worsening (if present). As stated, it calls upon clinical judgement, usually in the context of incomplete records, without comprehensive medical tests undertaken at the time. In other words, clinical judgement will involve drawing inferences in the absence of a full set of objective physical tests. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2007] AATA 1163">For the purposes also of this part of the decision I am aware of the recent decision of Finn J in Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436. His Honour then decided that clinical worsening of a disease is a medical issue and is resolved by resorting to the definition of the disease in an applicable Statement of Principle. (Whilst the present case concerns clinical onset, the decision in Milenz is no less applicable). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2007] AATA 1148">'Clinical worsening' requires a 'medical-scientific standard not a lay standard' , with 'features or manifest symptoms of the disease' ( Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436). Unfortunately the SoP provides no guidance as to what might amount to a clinical worsening of hypertension. We looked at whether the blood pressure readings after Mr McPherson's operational service were more elevated than beforehand. The additional readings recorded by the veteran were: 
 Date Age Blood Pressure recorded (mmHg) 
 
 19/07/62 33 125/80 
 
 14/08/64 35 150/90 
 
 18/11/69 40 150/90 
 
 
(We note that there was either an additional reading or a misprint in lieu of 19 July 1962 recorded by Dr Wyndham on 14 September 1962, at 125/80). The majority of blood pressure readings between 1955 and 1969 are consistent with the SOP definition of hypertension but do not suggest any clinical worsening. In fact, after Mr McPherson's operational service, his blood pressure marginally improved between 1962 and 1969. </sentence>
