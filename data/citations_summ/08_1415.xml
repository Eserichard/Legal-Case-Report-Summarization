<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] ATMO 116">In its submissions, the Applicant has raised the issue as to how the onus is to be judged. In this regard, the currently-prevailing view (as expressed by Justice Gyles in Pfizer Products Inc. v. Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599) is that the ordinary test of the civil standard of proof (that is, on the balance of probabilities) should be applied. Submissions to that effect were accepted in the decision of Justice Jagot in Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc. v. Goulimis [2008] FCA 1415 ; (2008) AIPC 92-307 (but in the absence of argument to the contrary). More recently, the finding of Justice Gyles has been discussed with approval by Justice Sundberg in Chocolaterie Guylian NV v. Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891. The practice of the Registrar is to follow the current approach which is taken by the Federal Court of Australia, namely that a ground of opposition is required to be established on the balance of probabilities, and I propose to adopt that approach. (c) Relevant Time

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 638">A number of recent authorities have, however, endorsed its continuing application. Most significantly, in Food Channel, the Full Court affirmed, in reliance on Aston, that "the very act of making the application is, without more, sufficient to establish the requisite intention" ([67]). See also Television Food at [95] where Collier J stated that: 
 
 
 making an application for registration is prima facie evidence of an intention to use: Aston v Harlee Manufacturing Co [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 401; [1960] HCA 47 ; [1960] ALR 605 at 611; [1960] HCA 47 per Fullagar J, Kimberly-Clark Worldwide Inc v Goulimis (2008) 253 ALR 76 ; 78 IPR 612 ; [2008] FCA 1415 at [10] . 
 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] ATMO 42">At least for the purpose of making a comparison under Section 60, the Applicant's argument that the respective trade marks can be differentiated on this basis is answered and overcome. The obvious inference that is reasonably available to members of the public on encountering the "CSL MONEY" trade marks of the Applicant is that the Opponent has commenced the conduct of business in its own right in relation to financial services and by means of use of the expression "CSL MONEY". Some additional assistance is provided by the decision of Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc. v. Goulimis [2008] FCA 1415 ; (2008) AIPC 92-307 and in particular, I refer to the following wording of Justice Jagot, namely: 
Section 60 involves deceptive similarity by reason of reputation. The evidence establishes that the opponent's trade mark HUGGIES has acquired a reputation in Australia. The opponent's trade marks (registered and unregistered) involve both the word HUGGIES alone and the word HUGGIES with other words.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] ATMO 22">In the decision of Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc. v. Goulimis [2008] FCA 1415 ; (2008) AIPC 92-307 Justice Jagot reached the finding (at paras. 47-8) that, in the face of the opponent's "HUGGIES" trade mark, the "HUGGIE" MUMMY mark of the applicant did fall within the scope of Section 42(b). That conclusion relied on the finding by his Honour that the essential feature of the application is the word "HUGGIE" and that the applicant's "HUGGIE" MUMMY mark would be likely to cause consumers in the relevant market to wonder whether the opponent is the source of those services which are provided by the applicant. 
 [5] Apple Computer Inc. v. Todaytech Group Limited [2007] ATMO 40 per Hearing Officer Lyons (the MACRON case) and in Health World Limited v. Shin-Sun Australia Pty. Limited [2008] FCA 100 per Justice Jacobson (the HEALTHPLUS case). This issue was also considered by Justice Jagot in Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc. v. Goulimis [2008] FCA 1415 ; (2008) AIPC 92-307 at paragraph 4. AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 271">Legal principles relevant to the application of s 59 which I consider relevant to the proceedings before me include the following: the intention described in s 59 must exist at the filing date: Nikken Wellness Pty Ltd v Van Voorst [2003] FCA 816 ; the intention must relate to the applicant or an authorised user or potential assignee of the applicant; making an application for registration is prima facie evidence of an intention to use ( Aston v Harlee Manufacturing Co [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 401 per Fullagar J, Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc v Goulimis [2008] FCA 1415 ; (2008) 78 IPR 612 at [10] ); once a prima facie case of lack of intention is established the evidentiary onus shifts to the trade mark applicant to establish intention ( Health World [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 at [163] affirmed Health World Limited [2009] FCAFC 14) ; provided the intention to use is sufficiently definite, it does not matter that the mark will not be used immediately (cf Re Peddie's Application (1944) 61 RPC 31 and cases cited in Shanahan at 5.1420); the intention, or lack thereof, to which s 59 is directed is a real and definite intention of the applicant for registration, to use the mark publicly as a trade mark, although not necessarily immediately or within a limited time ( Health World Ltd [2008] FCA 100 at [163] , Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158) ; the intention to use must be bona fide (cf s 62A of the Act). </sentence>
