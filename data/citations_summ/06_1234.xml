<citphrase id="cp66.1" type=citing from="[2009] WAIRComm 1360">[67]: amongst the circumstances relevant to determining inconsistency, it is clear from carnell and bennett that the purpose for which the privilege-holder made the disclosure is highly relevant. the question here was whether the use made by the minister of the disclosed portion of the privileged communication</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp66.2" type=citing from="[2009] WAIRComm 1360">more particularly, the purpose for which the conclusion was disclosed</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp66.3" type=citing from="[2009] WAIRComm 1360">was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in respect of the content of the advice. first it is necessary to restate the purpose of the confidentiality which the privilege preserves. in grant v downs , stephen, mason and murphy jj said: 'the rationale of this head of privilege, according to traditional doctrine, is that it promotes the public interest because it assists and enhances the administration of justice by facilitating the representation of clients by legal advisers, the law being a complex and complicated discipline. this it does by keeping secret their communications, thereby inducing the client to retain the solicitor and seek his advice, and encouraging the client to make a full and frank disclosure of the relevant circumstances to the solicitor.' [1976] hca 63 ; (1976) 135 clr 674 at 685. later, in baker v campbell , mason j noted that the underlying policy of the privilege covering legal advice</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp66.4" type=citing from="[2009] WAIRComm 1360">'involved the promotion of freedom of consultation generally between lawyer and client.' [1983] hca 39 ; (1983) 153 clr 52 at 74. in the same case, deane j said that the principle underlying the privilege was that</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp66.5" type=citing from="[2009] WAIRComm 1360">'a person should be entitled to seek and obtain legal advice without the apprehension of being prejudiced by the subsequent disclosure of confidential communications.'  the evident purpose of the attorney-general's disclosure was to inform the public that the recommendation he had made to the governor</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp66.6" type=citing from="[2009] WAIRComm 1360">that the petition for mercy be denied</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp66.7" type=citing from="[2009] WAIRComm 1360">was based on independent legal advice, advice which recommended that each ground advanced in the petition should be rejected. the attorney-general evidently wished it to be known that, in considering whether or not the prerogative of mercy should be exercised, he had taken independent advice and was making a recommendation which accorded with that advice. in the language of carnell , this was a disclosure 'for the purpose of explaining or justifying' the attorney-general's actions. the purpose was similar to that of the disclosure in carnell itself, where the chief minister wished to satisfy the relevant member of parliament that the act government 'had acted responsibly and in accordance with legal advice'. in my opinion, there was no inconsistency between disclosing the fact of, and the conclusions of, the independent advice for that purpose, and wishing to maintain the confidentiality of the advice itself. this was not a case of a party to litigation 'deploying' a partial disclosure for forensic advantage, while seeking unfairly to deny the other party an opportunity to see the full text of the privileged communication. nor was it 'the laying open of the confidential communication to necessary scrutiny'. (approved on appeal in osland v secretary to the department of justice ( osland hca) (2008) 234 clr 275 ; 249 alr 1 ; [2008] hca 37)  to constitute waiver, the conduct of the party entitled to the privilege must be judged inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect: osland hca [45]. in considering this issue it is relevant to consider the purpose of disclosing the advice and the element of fairness. whether a limited disclosure of the existence, and the effect, of legal advice is inconsistent with maintaining confidentiality will depend upon the circumstances of the case. questions of waiver are matters of fact and degree: osland hca [49]; nine films and television pty ltd v ninox television ltd [2005] fca 356 ; (2005) 65 ipr 442 [26]. the report discloses part of the substance of advice that is confidential. whilst there is nothing before me to suggest that the report was disclosed for the purpose of obtaining an unfair advantage, could it be said that it is unfair that only part of the legal advice has been disclosed? as mason and brennan jj in maurice explained, fairness usually requires that where one part of a communication has been waived, waiver should result in the disclosure of the whole of the communication so that the opposing litigant is not mislead by an inaccurate perception (487</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp66.8" type=citing from="[2009] WAIRComm 1360">488) (applied by in goldberg v ng [1995] hca 39 ; (1995) 185 clr 83 , 96 deane, dawson, gaudron jj): an implied waiver occurs when, by reason of some conduct on the privilege holder's part, it becomes unfair to maintain the privilege. the holder of the privilege should not be able to abuse it by using it to create an inaccurate perception of the protected communication. professor wigmore explains: 'when his conduct touches a certain point of disclosure, fairness requires that his privilege shall cease whether he intended that result or not. he cannot be allowed, after disclosing as much as he pleases, to withhold the remainder' (wigmore: evidence in trials at common law (1961) vol 8, par 2327, p 636). in order to ensure that the opposing litigant is not misled by an inaccurate perception of the disclosed communication, fairness will usually require that waiver as to one part of a protected communication should result in waiver as to the rest of the communication on that subject matter: see great atlantic insurance co . a copy of the report was provided to the applicants sometime in august 2007. the report was provided to the applicants prior to the meeting of the sstuwa executive on 14 september 2007 which was also prior to the meeting of the state council of the sstuwa on 17 november 2007 at which the decision of the sstuwa executive to dismiss the applicants was endorsed. during oral submissions mr sharpe, however, informed the commission (without objection) that copies of letters from the then president of the intervener to the applicants which were referred to in the report were not provided to the applicants until after the meeting of the executive. the intervener says that the report was provided to the applicants to provide them with procedural fairness as their position was affected. other than obvious fact that the applicants are unable to judge (in the absence of an examination of the legal advice) whether the statements about the advice in the report are accurate or complete, no issue of unfairness to the applicants appears to arise in this matter. on the other hand, the fact that part of the legal advice was disclosed with the purpose of providing procedural fairness to the applicants can be said to raise fairness in favour of the applicants. in providing a copy of the report has the intervener acted inconsistently with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege protects? in my opinion the answer is no, as the purpose for which the portion of legal advice was disclosed was not inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality. in osland the attorney-general disclosed in a press statement that he had made a recommendation to the governor that a petition of mercy be denied and his recommendation was based on independent legal advice. maxwell p in osland ca considered this to be a disclosure 'for the purpose of explaining or justifying' the attorney-general's actions. he found there was no inconsistency between disclosing the fact of, and the conclusions of, the independent advice for that purpose, with wishing to maintain the confidentiality of the advice itself. on appeal to the high court, gleeson cj, gummow, heydon and kiefel jj in osland hca stated in conclusion that the reasoning of maxwell p was correct [50]. kirby j in his separate judgment also agreed there had been no waiver and found the purpose of issuing a press statement was compatible with non-disclosure as the purpose of issuing the press statement was to show the state had taken a proper course in obtaining and considering advice [97]-[98]. the purpose of providing a copy of the report was to provide to the applicants the basis on which the executive acted to make the resolutions to dismiss the applicants in each case from the office as a district delegate to state council. as it is not in dispute that this was done in the interests of natural justice as the position of the applicants were affected, the provision of the copy of the report to the applicants can not be said to be inconsistent with the confidentiality of the privilege as it can not be said that the report was provided to advance a forensic purpose or any other purpose to disadvantage the applicants. for these reasons the applicants' application to set aside legal privilege will be dismissed.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] WAICmr 31">The principles for the displacement of legal professional privilege due to an illegal or improper purpose can be found in the judgments of the High Court in Kearney and Propend. In Propend, Gaudron J at 545 referred to Dawson J's judgment in Kearney at 528-529, for different formulations of the nature of the wrongdoing which 'displaces' legal professional privilege. These include " a criminal or unlawful act", "an improper or an illegal act", "illegality or fraud or trickery", "crime or civil fraud" and "wrongdoing" --- see also AWB v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 at [210] - [212]. Communications made for an illegal purpose, such as an abuse of statutory power, are also not covered by the privilege: see Gibbs CJ in Kearney at 515.

Relevantly to this application, his Honour held that although the onus of proof lies on the Receivers to satisfy the court that the privilege exists, it will usually be sufficient simply to show that a client has consulted a lawyer in Australia concerning a legal problem, and there is nothing controversial about the circumstances in which the client has approached the lawyer: [44](4) citing Kennedy v Wallace [2004] FCAFC 337 ; (2004) 142 FCR 185 , 192 [27] (Black CJ &amp; Emmett J). This may also have been the reason why Owen J suggested that there is an evidentiary onus of proof upon a party challenging an assertion of legal professional privilege to show that the claim is either unfounded or mistaken: Brambles Holdings Ltd v WMC Engineering Services Pty Ltd (1995) 14 WAR 239 , 247 (Kennedy &amp; Rowland JJ not deciding the point: 240, 243).</sentence>

The same view was taken by Lee J in Candacal [Candacal Pty Ltd v Industry Research and Development Board [143] ] at [99], by Gillard J in Australian Hospital Care (Pindara) Pty Ltd v Duggan [1999] VSC 131 at [111] , and by Downes J in McKinnon v Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade [2004] AATA 1365 ; (2004) 86 ALD 780 at [51] . " [144] 

84. Justice Young writes of cases having " ... added a requirement that the lawyer who provided that advice must be admitted to practice " and refers first to the judgment of Dawson J. I respectfully disagree with this analysis of the judgment of Dawson J in Waterford . [88] 

 B.2 What is legal advice? 

 
41. In Australian Wheat Board v Cole (No 5) [89] ( Cole ), Young J touched on what is encompassed within the expression " legal advice ":
 
" The concept of legal advice is fairly wide. It extends to professional advice as to what a party should prudently or sensibly do in the relevant legal context: but it does not extend to advice that is purely commercial or of a public relations character ... " [90] 


 B.3 The privilege may encompass communications with third parties 

 
42. Legal professional privilege protects communications made by both parties to those communications. 

 
41. In Australian Wheat Board v Cole (No 5) [89] ( Cole ), Young J touched on what is encompassed within the expression " legal advice ":
 
" The concept of legal advice is fairly wide. It extends to professional advice as to what a party should prudently or sensibly do in the relevant legal context: but it does not extend to advice that is purely commercial or of a public relations character ... " [90] 


 B.3 The privilege may encompass communications with third parties 

 
42. Legal professional privilege protects communications made by both parties to those communications. Therefore, as well as protecting communications made to the client by the legal adviser, it will also protect communications made by the client for the dominant purpose of seeking legal advice:
 
" ... [L] egal professional privilege extends to notes, memoranda or other documents made by officers or employees of the client that relate to information sought by the client's legal adviser to enable him or her to advise ... Brennan J approached the matter differently but, in my respectful opinion, and contrary to what Branson J seems to have thought ( Rich at [39]), none of the other members of the Court adopted his Honour's approach. 
 
 Thus, with the greatest respect, I doubt that the decision in Waterford requires anything more than that the legal adviser be professionally qualified and acting in a professional capacity. I note that in AWB v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 , 234 ALR 651 at 664 [44] , to which her Honour did not refer, Young J considered that the question of independence involved no more than an inquiry into whether the lawyer was consulted in her or his professional legal capacity, although his Honour also pointed out that some cases have added a requirement that the lawyer who provided the advice must be admitted to practice. 
 
 Mercifully, it is not necessary in this case for me to decide whether her Honour was correct in the approach she took. The respondent was content that I decide the matter on the basis of her Honour's formulation, arguing that it was satisfied here. Legal professional privilege protects communications made by both parties to those communications. Therefore, as well as protecting communications made to the client by the legal adviser, it will also protect communications made by the client for the dominant purpose of seeking legal advice:
 
" ... [L] egal professional privilege extends to notes, memoranda or other documents made by officers or employees of the client that relate to information sought by the client's legal adviser to enable him or her to advise ... The privilege extends to drafts, notes and other material brought into existence by the client for the purpose of communication to the lawyer, whether or not they are themselves actually communicated to the lawyer ... " [91] 

 
43. When Hodgson J decided Standard Chartered Bank of Australia Ltd v Antico , [92] the relevant test was one of sole purpose and not of dominant purpose as it now is. Despite this, his further comment regarding the compass of legal professional privilege remains relevant:
 
"... It seems to me that the sole purpose is to be applied to the original communication, and then the privilege will normally extend to notes or memoranda of that advice without the necessity of again applying the sole purpose test: however, the purpose of the notes, memoranda or minutes will be relevant in deciding whether they can fairly be described as being records of the legal advice rather than of something else . The disclosures in question here were made variously to the IIC, to the Australian Government, to the Commission and in some instances via the procedures of the Commission to the public at large. In my opinion, there is no reason why these disclosures cannot support a finding that AWB has waived legal professional privilege over associated material. " [204] 

129. When the client is a statutory body acting independently of the State or Commonwealth, any legal professional privilege that the statutory body may claim may be claimed by the State or Commonwealth in all its emanations. Therefore, for example, the privilege that the Office of Film and Literature Classification had over documents brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice regarding the exercise of its statutory powers was equally that of the Commonwealth in all of its emanations. I will return to that below but, [104] assuming that is the case and that:
 
"... communications take place between a client and his or her independent legal advisers, or between a client's in-house lawyers and those legal advisers, it may be appropriate to assume that legitimate legal advice was being sought, absent any contrary indications .... In Kennedy v Wallace , [ [105] ] Black CJ and Emmett J inclined to the view that in the ordinary case of a client consulting a lawyer about a legal problem in uncontroversial circumstances, proof of those facts alone will provide a sufficient basis for a conclusion that legitimate legal advice is being sought or given. 
 
 ... " [106] 

55. Where these matters are in dispute, the party claiming legal professional privilege must establish it on the balance of probabilities. That is no different in the context of a claim for exemption under s 42 of the FOI Act for s 61(1) provides that the agency or Minister has the onus or burden of establishing that the decision was justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2011] VSC 341">48 It appears that there is no authority on the question of whether the fraud, offence or act that renders a person liable to a civil penalty to which reference is made in s 125(1)(a) must be committed by the client who has the benefit of the privilege. There is, however, authority for the proposition that the common law so-called 'crime or fraud exception' applies to legal advice given in furtherance of a fraud committed by a third party in which the client is not knowingly involved. [15]  40 At common law, a broad view was adopted regarding the meaning of fraud in the socalled 'crime or fraud exception' to privilege. Under the common law, fraud was not confined to actual dishonesty; equitable fraud involving breaches of fiduciary duty that fell short of actual dishonesty sufficed. [9] </sentence>

Evidence of the intention of the document's maker, or of the person who authorised or procured it, is not necessarily conclusive. It may be necessary to examine the evidence concerning the purpose of other persons involved in the hierarchy of decision-making or consultation that led to the creation of the document and its subsequent communication.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2011] NSWADT 155">57 The broader principles governing legal professional privilege were usefully summarised by Young J in AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2006) 155 FCR 30 at 44. In applying those principles it is first necessary to decide in relation to each document for which the exemption is claimed, whether the agency has discharged the onus of establishing that it was brought into existence, for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice. The 'dominant purpose test' refers to: 
 

 
 a document which was produced or brought into existence either with the dominant purpose of its author, or of the person or authority under whose direction, whether particular or general, it was produced or brought into existence, of using it or its contents in order to obtain legal advice, or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation, at the time of its production in reasonable prospect... the fact that the person... had in mind other uses of the document will not preclude that document being accorded privilege, if it were produced with the requisite dominant purpose.

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2011] AATA 372">In AWB Ltd v Cole and Another (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2006) 155 FCR 30 , Young J discussed the nature of the documents to which the privilege may apply. He said at [44(8)] that: 
 
 Legal professional privilege protects the disclosure of documents that record legal work carried out by the lawyer for the benefit of the client, such as research memoranda, collations and summaries of documents, chronologies and the like ... 
 

His Honour said at [44(9)]:
 
 
 Subject to meeting the dominant purpose test, legal professional privilege extends to notes, memoranda and other documents made by officers or employees of the client that relate to information sought by the client's legal adviser to enable him or her to advise...

[46]  Held: application granted - Alliance precluded from relying on grounds previously argued in the Federal Court; Quasar (through Heathgate) was acting as agent of the joint venture, and therefore as agent of Alliance; the agency did not, of itself, create joint privilege in the documents; parties held a shared interest in the documents, and as such the formal legal relationship between them created a duty to disclose - Quasar and Heathgate to disclose all documents over which privilege was claimed up to the date of execution of the NTMA, but not thereafter.

 WHITE J. The defendants, Quasar Resources Pty Ltd (Quasar) and Heathgate Resources Pty Ltd (Heathgate), have each made disclosure of documents in accordance with the Rules of Court. Alliance, on the other hand, submitted that the test to be applied was not so stringent. It referred to AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) [43] in which Young J said that the Court of Appeal in British American Tobacco had expressed the position concerning waiver of associated material too narrowly. [44] Young J, relying on Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [45] said that the test to be applied to determine the scope of any waiver of associated material is whether the material that the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the same issue or subject matter.

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2011] VSC 194">19 It is unnecessary for me to survey the various authorities to which the Court was referred on the applicable principles. Those common law principles inform the content of s 118 of the Evidence Act . A very useful and comprehensive exposition of the legal principles was given by Young J in AWB Limited v Cole. [2] Other instructive cases are Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT, [3] Re Southland Coal Pty Ltd, [4] Meteyard v Love, [5] GSA Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v Constable, [6] and Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty v VWA.

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2011] FCA 479">Mr Moses SC also submitted that assistance is to be obtained, from his client's perspective, from the well known decision of Young J in AWB Limited v Cole (No. 5) [2006] FCA 1234 ; [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2006) 155 FCR 30 , and in particular, the passage at 44 [44]. There, his Honour set out a number of principles which he distilled from the authorities. Mr Moses SC did not rely upon all of them. He did, however, rely upon the following excerpts from five of them:
 
 
 (1) The party claiming privilege carries the onus of proving that the communication was undertaken, or the document was brought into existence, for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice... 
 

 
 
 (2) The purpose for which a document is brought into existence is a question of fact that must be determined objectively... 
 

 
 
 (3) The existence of legal professional privilege is not established merely by the use of verbal formula ... Nor is a claim of privilege established by mere assertion that privilege applies to particular communications or that communications are undertaken for the purpose of obtaining or giving "legal advice" ... If assertions of that kind are received in evidence in support of the privilege claim, their conclusionary nature can leave unclear what advice was really being sought. There will be cases in which a claim for privilege will not be sustainable in the absence of evidence identifying the circumstances in which the relevant communication took place and the topics to which the instructions or advice were directed ... 
 

 
 
 ... 
 

 
 
 (5) A "dominant purpose" is one that predominates over other purposes; it is the prevailing or paramount purpose ... 
 

 
 
 (6) An appropriate starting point when applying the dominant purpose test is to ask what was the intended use or uses of the document which accounted for it being brought into existence... 
 

  Mr Moses SC submitted, in reliance upon those authorities, that there was no evidence about the thought process which lay behind the decision to claim the privilege, or the nature or the purpose of the advice being sought in respect of each document. The claim which was made was not focused or specific and neither was it the case that topics had been identified: cf AWB Limited v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2006) 155 FCR 30 at [44(3)] . </sentence>

But it did not extend to advice that was purely commercial or of a public relations character and reference was made to Balabel v Air India [1988] Ch 317 at 323, 330 amongst other cases.

This point was emphasised by Young J in AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) [229] when he expressed his view that:

  The common law decisions relating to legal professional privilege provide a useful background to the operation of the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 . I see little benefit in quoting from the plethora of decided cases, which discuss the principles of legal professional privilege in detail. In considering the issue in the present case I have had regard to the decisions in General Manager, WorkCover Authority of NSW v Law Society of NSW (2006) 65 NSWLR 502 , [2006] NSWCA 84 ; AWB v Cole No 5 [2006] FCA 1234 ; Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122 , (2004) 136 FCR 357 ; Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 , (1976) 135 CLR 674 ; and Trade Practices Commission v Sterling [1979] FCA 33 ; [1979] FCA 33 ; (1979) 36 FLR 244 among others.

<sentence id="cs20" from="[2010] FCA 950">Thus, with the greatest respect, I doubt that the decision in Waterford requires anything more than that the legal adviser be professionally qualified and acting in a professional capacity. I note that in AWB v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 , 234 ALR 651 at 664 [44] , to which her Honour did not refer, Young J considered that the question of independence involved no more than an inquiry into whether the lawyer was consulted in her or his professional legal capacity, although his Honour also pointed out that some cases have added a requirement that the lawyer who provided the advice must be admitted to practice. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2010] AATA 649">Legal professional privilege protects communications made by both parties to those communications. Therefore, as well as protecting communications made to the client by the legal adviser, it will also protect communications made by the client for the dominant purpose of seeking legal advice:
 
" ... [L] egal professional privilege extends to notes, memoranda or other documents made by officers or employees of the client that relate to information sought by the client's legal adviser to enable him or her to advise ... The privilege extends to drafts, notes and other material brought into existence by the client for the purpose of communication to the lawyer, whether or they are themselves actually communicated to the lawyer ...

" (7) The dominant purpose is not the same as the 'primary' or the 'substantial' purpose: see Grant v Downs at CLR 678; ALR 580 per Barwick CJ. The 'dominant' purpose may be described as the ruling, prevailing, paramount or most influential purpose .... [126] 
 
 
93. In AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) , [127] Young J considered what amounts to legal advice:
 
" (7) The concept of legal advice is fairly wide. It extends to professional advice as to what a party should prudently or sensibly do in the relevant legal context; but it does not extend to advice that is purely commercial or of a public relations character ...

94. Legal professional privilege protects communications made by both parties to those communications. Once the necessary degree of independence has been established and:
 
"... communications take place between a client and his or her independent legal advisers, or between a client's in-house lawyers and those legal advisers, it may be appropriate to assume that legitimate legal advice was being sought, absent any contrary indications .... In Kennedy v Wallace , [ [153] ] Black CJ and Emmett J inclined to the view that in the ordinary case of a client consulting a lawyer about a legal problem in uncontroversial circumstances, proof of those facts alone will provide a sufficient basis for a conclusion that legitimate legal advice is being sought or given.

<sentence id="cs22" from="[2010] FCA 863">Attention was drawn on behalf of Mr Joyce not only to the passage from Maurice cited above but also to the way in which the test had been expressed by the Victorian Court of Appeal in British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Cowell [2002] VSCA 197 ; (2002) 7 VR 524 at [121] : 
 
 As we apprehend it, where legal professional privilege is waived in relation to one piece (or part) of advice, the privilege is impliedly waived in relation to another if - and only if - that other is necessary to a proper understanding of the first. As established by the High Court (at least since Mann v. Carnell ) the test in such cases is whether it would be "inconsistent" for a party to rely upon, and so to waive legal professional privilege in respect of, the one without also being taken to have waived privilege in respect of the other. ' 
 

Attention was further drawn to the following observation made by Young J in AWB Limited v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2006) 155 FCR 30 at [167] in respect of this passage from the British American Tobacco Case :
 
 
 It is no doubt correct that a mere reference to the existence of legal advice in a disclosed document will not be regarded as a waiver of its contents, albeit a different conclusion would follow if the gist, substance or conclusion of the legal advice is voluntarily disclosed. But, with great respect to their Honours, the proposition concerning waiver of associated material is expressed too narrowly and in a way that is not consistent with the test propounded by the High Court in Maurice. The principle propounded by the Court of Appeal may work adequately enough in some circumstances, particularly where privilege is sought to be maintained over one part of a single piece of legal advice, but in other circumstances it will not give effect to the principles explained in Maurice. 
 

 
 
 I respectfully agree with the observation made by Young J. 
 
  The basis in legal principle of the claim for client legal privilege made by Prudentia, Hanley and Mr Reed is to be found in the following passage from the judgment of Young J in AWB Limited v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2005) 155 FCR 30 at [47] : 
 
 Where a lawyer has been retained for the purposes of providing legal advice in relation to a particular transaction or series of transactions, communications between the lawyer and the client relating to that transaction will be privileged, notwithstanding that they do not contain advice on matters of law; it is enough that they are directly related to the performance by the lawyer of his or her professional duty as legal adviser to the client: Minter v Priest [1930] AC 558 at 581---586; Balabel at 330; Nederlandse at 983 and Dalleagles at 332---333.

 "Under the test propounded in Mann , it is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect which effects a waiver of the privilege. Fairness has become a subsidiary consideration; it may be relevant to the court's assessment of inconsistency in some contexts but not in others. ... The broad question posed by Mann is whether, and to what extent, AWB's disclosures are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the documents which are at issue in these proceedings. This question wraps up several subsidiary issues, in particular whether AWB's disclosures involved, on each occasion, a disclosure of the gist or substance of its legal advice, whether AWB consciously deployed that advice so as to advance its own commercial or other interests, and, if so, whether that disclosure has resulted in an imputed waiver of privilege over any and what associated materials. In any application of Mann , the starting point must be an analysis of the disclosures or other acts or omissions of the party claiming privilege that are said to be inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the privileged material: see Rio Tinto at [45].

They thereby waived privilege over associated material ( AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 at [127] - [176]). The class of documents in Schedule 1 Part 2 is associated material because it deals with the same subject matter as the material over which privilege has been waived and it forms the basis of that material. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs30" from="[2009] FCA 1293">The determination of the dominant purpose is a question of fact that must be determined objectively. It is not the same as the 'primary' or the 'substantial' purpose ( Grant v Downs at 678). The dominant purpose may be best described as the ruling, prevailing, paramount or most influential purpose ( Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victoria WorkCover Authority [2002] VSCA 59 ; (2002) 4 VR 332 at 336 --- 337). Where the claim is in respect of communications in documents, the court may examine the documents to ascertain the purpose for their creation (Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at 70). An appropriate starting point is to ask what was the intended use or uses of the document which accounted for it being brought into existence ( Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 (' Pratt ') at [35] per Finn J, confirmed in AWB v Cole (No. 5) [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2006) 155 FCR 30 at [44]). If a court finds on the balance of probabilities that the entirety of the document was created for the requisite purpose, then the entire document attracts the privilege. If a court finds that parts, but not all of the document, were created for this purpose, then those parts will attract the privilege (see GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology [2000] FCA 593 at [11] ; Grofam Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 408 at 414 --- 417). </sentence>

In AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2006) 155 FCR 30 , his Honour summarised the general principles as follows at [44]:

 
 
 The general principles that I consider relevant to the disposition of this case can be summarised as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 (1) The party claiming privilege carries the onus of proving that the communication was undertaken, or the document was brought into existence, for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice. The onus might be discharged by evidence as to the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred or the documents were brought into existence, or by evidence as to the purposes of the person who made the communication, or authored the document, or procured its creation. It might also be discharged by reference to the nature of the documents, supported by argument or submissions: see Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 689; Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1247 ; (2005) 60 ATR 466 at [30] ; and AWB v Cole at [63].</sentence>

 "The review applicant must make out a case, at least to a point where the Tribunal is satisfied that there is a prima facie case. The agency should be called upon to respond at that point. 
 


 
 
 In this case Mrs Howell did not put on any evidence, though there had been extensive reference to 'improper purpose' in the submissions prepared and filed by Mr Howell before the hearing (see submissions filed 24 October 2005) and again in the submissions filed after the hearing (on 10 March 2006). </sentence>

 "Where a lawyer has been retained for the purposes of providing legal advice in relation to a particular transaction or series of transactions, communications between the lawyer and the client relating to that transaction will be privileged, notwithstanding they do not contain advice on matters of law; it is enough that they are directly related to the performance by the lawyer of his or her professional duty as a legal adviser to the client . In Dalleagles , Anderson J said that professional discourse in a professional capacity between a solicitor and his client with reference to the transactions covered by his instructions should be regarded as prima facie for the purpose of giving and receiving advice. In his Honour's view, this would apply to any communication that is on its face a communication of a professional nature from the solicitor to the client or his agent touching the subject matter of the solicitor's engagement and any communication from the client to the solicitor in connection with that engagement.

The plaintiff challenges the right of the sixth defendant to redact those parts of the documents on that basis. The relevant principles on this question are not controversial and may be briefly stated. A document which is created for the "dominant" purpose of obtaining legal advice may be the subject of legal professional privilege. [26] The party asserting the privilege bears the onus of establishing its entitlement to rely on it. [27] Where the existence of legal professional privilege is in issue, the Court is not bound by the ritual incantation of a formula asserting privilege by the party resisting production of the document.

<sentence id="cs46" from="[2008] VSCA 59">3 The determination of dominant purpose is a matter for the Court, as the authorities make clear. We refer first to what Kenny J said in Commissioner of Taxation v Pratt Holdings: [2] 
 
The purpose for which a document is brought into existence is a question of fact. Where there are a number of purposes for the creation of a document, it can be difficult to identify the dominant purpose. The dominant purpose must be determined objectively, having regard to the evidence, the nature of the documents and the parties' submissions. The purpose will ordinarily be that of the maker of the document, but this will not always be the case. We also refer to what Young J said in Australian Wheat Board v Terrence Cole : [3] 
 
The purpose for which a document is brought into existence is a question of fact that must be determined objectively. Evidence of the intention of the document's maker, or of the person who authorised or procured it, is not necessarily conclusive. It may be necessary to examine the evidence concerning the purpose of other persons involved in the hierarchy of decision-making or consultation that led to the creation of the document and its subsequent communication.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs47" from="[2008] NSWCA 26">85 The Appeal Panel relied on the judgment of Young J in the Federal Court of Australia in AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2006) 155 FCR 30 for its statement of the "improper purpose" exception to legal professional privilege. The Appeal Panel said, at [46]-[49] of its first-stage reasons:

 It is not necessary to prove an improper purpose on the balance of probabilities. The 'prima facie' test arguably reflects the fact that issues of legal professional privilege are usually dealt with in the interlocutory stages of a proceeding, but the authorities have not departed from that formulation where a declaration is sought in relation to privilege issues. It must also be established, on the same prima facie basis, that the communication which is the subject of the claim for privilege was made in furtherance of, or as a step preparatory to, the commission of the fraud or wrongdoing. (References omitted. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs49" from="[2008] NSWSC 151">3 There was agreement between the parties that the following principles apply in relation to a claim for privilege and waiver (I take this exposition from the written submissions of Mr Speakman and Mr Moujalli):

 
(a) Section 118 protects confidential communications and the contents of confidential documents made or prepared for the dominant purpose of a lawyer providing legal advice to a client. In this context, "the concept of legal advice is fairly wide": AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2006) 155 FCR 30 at [44(7)] per Young J. In General Manager, WorkCover Authority of NSW v Law Society of NSW [2006] NSWCA 84 at [77] - [78], McColl JA quoted, with apparent approval, the observation of Taylor LJ in Balabel v Air India [1988] Ch 317 at 330, that "legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law; it must include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context". To qualify as legal advice, the lawyer must make the communication in the professional capacity of a lawyer: at [90].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs50" from="[2008] NTSC 9">I was referred by counsel to the very helpful judgment of Young J in AWB Ltd v Cole &amp; Anor (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2006) 234 ALR 651 and of the High Court in Attorney-General for the Northern Territory v Maurice &amp; Ors [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475.</sentence>

37 Presumption of regularity . Mr McGuirk submitted in relation to the Tribunal's reference to Industrial Equity Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 46 ; (1990) 170 CLR 649 , that Gaudron J was in dissent and her comment was simply obiter and therefore not binding. The issue in that case was the circumstances in which an improper purpose could be inferred in relation to a decision made under a statutory power. That was not the issue facing the Tribunal. The issue the Tribunal was addressing was whether legal professional privilege had been lost because the communications in the disputed documents had been made in furtherance of a crime or fraud, or some other illegal purpose. The presumption of regularity does not apply in those circumstances because the communication does not involve an 'official act' such as the exercise of a power under a statute. To the extent that the Tribunal found that the presumption of regularity was relevant to the issue it had to decide, it was in error. The correct principle is that the party alleging an illegal purpose must present a prima facie case to support the allegations. It is not necessary to prove an illegal purpose on the balance of probabilities: AWB v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 [218] per Young J.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs57" from="[2007] NSWADTAP 38">21 Another way in which legal professional privilege may be lost is where the communication contained in the document furthers some wrong doing. The wrong doing may be a crime including fraud, an abuse of statutory power or some improper purpose. (See Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1996] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 545 and Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney [1985] HCA 60 ; (1985) 158 CLR 500. ) In a decision handed down after the Tribunal delivered its reasons, Young J described the activities encompassed by this principle:
 
 
 The principle encompasses a wide species of fraud, criminal activity or actions taken for illegal or improper purposes and extends to 'trickery' and 'shams'. As the fraud exception is based on public policy grounds, it is sufficiently flexible to capture a range of situations where the protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client would be contrary to the public interest. ( AWB v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 , [210]. )  29 Relevance of conduct prior to receiving instructions . Mr McGuirk's next ground of appeal relates to the words underlined in [48]. He submitted that that statement fails to correctly apply the legal principles relating to the furtherance of wrong doing as described by Young J in AWB Limited v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234. Mr McGuirk appears to be referring to the following passages at [214] to [215] of that decision (footnotes deleted):
 
 
 Where a client is engaged in fraudulent conduct, communications with his or her lawyer in furtherance of the fraud are not privileged, regardless of whether the lawyer is a party to the fraud or not. The principle applies to communications passing between a client and lawyer where the lawyer is innocent of the fraud or improper purpose. 26 Incorrect test . Mr McGuirk relies on a passage from the recent decision of AWB v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 at [218] in support of his contention that the Tribunal misstated the principle in relation to the nature of evidence necessary to raise the issue of improper purpose:
 
 
 It is not necessary to prove an improper purpose on the balance of probabilities. The 'prima facie' test arguably reflects the fact that issues of legal professional privilege are usually dealt with in the interlocutory stages of a proceeding, but the authorities have not departed from that formulation where a declaration is sought in relation to privilege issues: Butler; Propend; Beazley. It must also be established, on the same prima facie basis, that the communication which is the subject of the claim for privilege was made in furtherance of, or as a step preparatory to, the commission of the fraud or wrongdoing.  31 Alternatively, the Department submitted that there is nothing in the judgment of Young J in AWB Limited v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 that was drawn to the Appeal Panel's attention, which is inconsistent with the Tribunal's findings. We agree with the Department's alternative submission. There is nothing in the decision of Young J which departs from Gaudron J's approach in Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1996] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501at 545 or the conclusion of the Tribunal when applying that decision. The Tribunal set out the relevant passage at [19] of the decision: 
 
 
 Communications made in furtherance of future wrongdoing fall outside legal professional privilege, although there is no particularly precise statement as to the nature of the wrongdoing that produces that result. However, legal professional privilege clearly extends to the situation in which a person seeks advice with respect to past misdeeds. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs58" from="[2007] FamCA 786">20. In AWB v Cole [4] and AWB Ltd v Honourable Terrence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 5) [5] Young J observed: 
 
 
 The onus might be discharged by evidence as to the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred or the documents were brought into existence, or by evidence as to the purposes of the person who made the communication, or authored the document, or procured its creation. It might also be discharged by reference to the nature of the documents, supported by argument or submissions. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs61" from="[2007] VSC 113">24 Subsequent authorities have held that the exception is not limited to crime or fraud in the technical sense, and may include communications made to further an illegal purpose. [13] In this case, there is no dispute that the alleged breaches by Anthony Porto of his fiduciary and statutory duties would fall within the concept of fraud. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs62" from="[2007] FCA 477">57 It is well recognised that a claim of legal professional privilege will not be upheld if the party resisting the claim for legal professional privilege can show reasonable grounds for believing that the communication effected by the document for which privilege is claimed was made for an illegal or improper purpose: Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1996] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 ; Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney [1985] HCA 60 ; (1985) 158 CLR 500 ; and see generally AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 at [211] - [219]. This does not require a demonstration that the legal advisers were themselves conscious participants in fulfilling the improper purpose: Yunghanns v Elfic Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 113 ; (2000) 1 VR 92 at 106. While it is not sufficient merely to allege improper purpose, it is not necessary fully to prove the allegations.

<sentence id="cs63" from="[2007] NSWSC 258">49 In Thomas v State of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 380 , McClellan CJ at CL held that service of an affidavit attaching an advice of counsel which in turn referred to certain medical reports, waived privilege in the medical reports because they influenced the content of the advice (at [17]). The principle is the same. The same principle was applied by Young J in AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 1234 at [168] - [178] in holding that disclosure of the substance of legal advice impliedly waived privilege over associated material as the publication of the legal advice was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality over such material which underpinned the advice. 50 As set out earlier in these reasons, Mr Smith, as he is required to do under the Expert Witness Code of Conduct, specified the materials used in support of his opinions.

On the presently available material, it can be said that in the present proceedings brought by BATAL and BATAS against Slater &amp; Gordon ("the breach of confidence proceedings"), BATAL and BATAS have seriously arguable cases for final relief to restrain the use or dissemination of their confidential information, which has come into the hands of Slater &amp; Gordon and Ms Cowell as a result of a breach of confidence by Mr Dale in circumstances in which the recipients ought to have been aware that there was a breach of confidence, but for the defence of iniquity. The main issue at the final hearing is likely to be whether there are "reasonable grounds for believing", or "a prima facie case", that the documents and information in which confidence and privilege are claimed disclose an iniquity; it will not be necessary for the Defendants to establish the iniquity on the balance of probabilities, although it would not suffice that the documents apparently "relate to" an iniquity; to be deprived of confidentiality or privilege they must contain or disclose an iniquity [ AWB Limited v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 , [217]-[218]; AG Australia Holdings Limited v Burton [2002] NSWSC 170 ; (2002) 58 NSWLR 464 , 520-1 [198]-[202], 523 [208]].</sentence>

 49 The main submission made by counsel for the appellants, Mr Middleton, Q.C., was that the communications made to and between the financiers and to Royce were not privileged, because they were not made for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice. In Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v. Propend Finance Pty Ltd [39] the majority of the High Court [40] held that a copy of a document brought into existence for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or conducting litigation, is privileged, even though the original document is not privileged. [41]  42 In AWB Ltd v. Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 5) [34] Young, J. said that --- 
 
 
 "The purpose for which a document is brought into existence is a question of fact that must be determined objectively. Evidence of the intention of the document's maker, or of the person who authorised or procured it, is not necessarily conclusive [35] . ... The Court has power to examine documents over which legal professional privilege is claimed. Where there is a disputed claim, the High Court has said that the court should not be hesitant to exercise such a power. " [36]  
 
 43 The documents for which privilege was claimed included cost invoices passed on to the financiers and documents provided to Royce in relation to a press release and preparation for a public meeting. Memoranda of costs are not privileged unless they disclose the nature of instructions given by a client or the advice given by a solicitor. [37] Ms Moon's affidavit of 25 th May 2005 swears that these memoranda of costs contain descriptive time sheet narrations of work conducted by legal advisers working on the matter. Her affidavit of 14 th June says that the documents provided to Royce included a "draft document with handwritten annotations by John Digby, Q.C. regarding preparation for a City of Moreland Public Meeting" and a Draft Media Release with marked up amendments by Anne Moon. In light of the description of these documents, it is questionable if they constitute legal advice, or public relations advice. As was recently noted by Young, J. in AWB Limited v. Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 5) : [38] 
 
 
 "The concept of legal advice is fairly wide. It extends to professional advice as to what a party should prudently or sensibly do in the relevant legal context; but it does not extend to advice that is purely commercial or of a public relations character: Balabel v. Air India [1988] 1 Ch 317 ('Balabel') at 323 and 330; Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV v. Bacon and Woodrow [1995] 1 All ER 976 ('Nederlandse') at 983; Three Rivers District Council v. Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No 6) [2004] UKHL 48 ; [2005] 1 AC 610 ('Three Rivers') at 652---653 [43]---[44], 657---658 [59]---[60], 681 [114] and 683 [120]; Dalleagles Pty Ltd v.

Cole at [100]---[101]. "  [72] At 13 [29]. [73] AWB Limited v. Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No. 5) [2006] FCA 1234 at [44] . [74] (1999) 165 A.L.R. 253.</sentence>

11 As was noted in the 2001 Land and Environment Court case, Mr Franks feels strongly that the conduct of the Council towards him has involved an abuse of public office, and the documents sought in this case being documents connected with the Council actions taken against him have lost the benefit of the privilege for that reason. The law on legal professional privilege recognises that the privilege is lost in respect of documents that conceal a deliberate abuse of statutory power: Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney [1985] HCA 60 ; (1985) 158 CLR 500 at 515; and see, recently, AWB Limited v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 (Young J) at [210] ff. In particular, Mr Franks believes that he was improperly the subject of bankruptcy proceedings brought against him in relation to his non-payment of costs. He claims that they were initiated by Council officers acting contrary to the decision of the elected Council. The Council's position is that its conduct was proper, and that included in the exempt documents is material which vindicates its conduct.
