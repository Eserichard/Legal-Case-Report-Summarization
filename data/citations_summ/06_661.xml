<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] ACTSC 136">21. In Morris v Hanley [2001] NSWCA 374 , a case that has been described (Spender J in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 661 (Citrus Queensland) at [18]) as marking "the 'high water mark' of a judge's obligation to give reasons for interlocutory orders", Heydon JA (with whom Foster and Rolfe AJJA agreed) found that there had been an "error of principle" by the primary judge. In an ex tempore judgment that Heydon JA described at [23] as "in many respects [going] well beyond what was called for by the duty to give reasons", and in which the primary judge said that the question of delay was a relevant factor, Heydon JA found at [24] that the primary judge had nevertheless not explained "how he took the defendants' delay into account". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 934">25 It is essential that a Federal Magistrate should give sufficient reasons for reaching the conclusion that an application should be dismissed summarily. They do not have to be elaborate or excessively detailed, but the touchstone is that the reasons must indicate to the parties why the decision was made in order to allow them to exercise such rights as may be available in respect of that decision: Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Ltd [1983] 3 NSWLR 378 at 386; SZDCJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1500 at [6] - [16]; Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 661 at [15] - [20].
