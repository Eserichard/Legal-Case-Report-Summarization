<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] NSWSC 759">6 On 10 December 2007, the Trustee, having obtained an extension of time in which to do so, filed in the Federal Court a notice of appeal from the judgment of Lloyd-Jones FM, which included by way of interlocutory relief a claim for a stay of the Federal Magistrate's orders. When the application for an extension of time in which to appeal had come before Buchanan J of the Federal Court on 6 December 2007, his Honour declined to deal with the application for a stay, saying: "I declined to entertain the application for a stay on the basis presented. The applicant may renew any such application if it wishes, in a more formal way, with appropriate evidentiary support if that is necessary" [ Sutherland v Vale [2007] FCA 1876 , [18]]. </sentence>
