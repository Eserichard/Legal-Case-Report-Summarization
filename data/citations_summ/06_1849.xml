<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWCA 48">Contextual considerations led to a broader meaning of the word "property" being adopted in the decisions in the field of corporate law in Elfic Ltd v Macks [2001] QCA 219 ; [2003] 2 Qd R 125 , Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd v Stork Food Systems Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 208 and Achieve Foundation Ltd v Acnewco Ltd [2010] FCA 382 ; (2010) 88 ACSR 673 but similar considerations are not in my view present in this case. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 739">10 A judge may feel disquiet about a transaction for which the Court's sanction or approval is required, such as termination of a liquidation or approval of an arrangement or reconstruction under Pt 5.1 Corporations Act . The disquiet may arise either from the terms of the transaction or because of the reputations of those involved. In such a case, the judge is entitled to ask for assistance from ASIC or from some other body or person having a legitimate interest in the proper scrutiny of the proposal: see generally Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee Report "Members Schemes of Arrangement" December 2009, paras 2.3.2 and 6.4.2. Such a course of action has been followed in cases such as Re Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849 per Lindgren J at [11]-[12]. For the reasons I have given, I took that course of action in this case.
 

 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 455">The next case to which reference may usefully be made is the decision of Lindgren J in Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd v Stork Food Systems Australasia Pty Ltd [13] where his Honour was concerned with s 413(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The Act allowed for approval to be given to schemes of arrangement where the whole or part of the undertaking or property of one company might be transferred to another company. Subsection 413(2) provided: 
"(2) Where an order made under this section provides for the transfer of property or liabilities, then, by virtue of the order, that property is transferred to and vests in, and those liabilities are transferred to and become the liabilities of, the transferee company, free, in the case of any particular property if the order so directs, from any charge that is, by virtue of the compromise or arrangement, to cease to have effect. "
 
 
The term "liabilities" was defined as including,
 
 
"duties of any description, including duties that are of a personal character or are incapable under the general law of being assigned or performed vicariously. "
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCAFC 34">26 The learned primary judge was not disposed to accept a submission by ASIC that the Court has to be satisfied that asbestos claimants would be no worse off after the demerger than before in order to order the meeting of shareholders. Her Honour summarised that submission in the following passage (at [25]):
 The objectors and ASIC submitted that the Court should dismiss the plaintiff's application unless clearly satisfied that the asbestos claimants would be no worse off after the demerger than before. That formulation draws on a comment made by Lindgren J in Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd v Stork Food Systems Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849 , (2006) ACLC 208. His Honour was considering the interests of asbestos claimants in connection with a scheme of arrangement which provided for all property of Stork ICM to be vested in Stork FSA. The property in question included ICM's contractual right to require insurers to indemnify it in respect of sums which it was, or might become, liable to pay to asbestos claimants as workers' compensation or common law damages. At [111] of his reasons his Honour said that in the course of the hearing he had indicated to the parties: 
 
 That I should not make the orders sought unless I was clearly satisfied that the potential claimants would be no worse off if the order were made than they would be otherwise. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 382">In Re Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849 ; 25 ACLC 208 , the potential liabilities under consideration by Lindgren J were described by his Honour at [92] as ... inchoate, potential or contingent liabilities ... This was because the definition covered claims in the future by asbestos victims arising from injury or illness already being suffered by those victims but in circumstances where they may not necessarily be aware of the fact that they had that illness or injury.  However, the reasoning of Lindgren J in Re Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849 ; 25 ACLC 208 is capable of application by analogy. The definition of property in s 413(4) of the Act, in effect, mirrors the ideas behind the definition of liabilities in the same subsection. Applying reasoning similar to that undertaken by Lindgren J in Re Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849 ; 25 ACLC 208 to the present question would lead to a similarly expansive view being taken of the definition of property as it appears in s 413(4).

The subject matter of Re Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849 ; 25 ACLC 208 was, of course, different from the subject matter of Order 6 and Order 7 in the present case. In Re Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849 ; 25 ACLC 208 , Lindgren J was dealing with liabilities. In particular, his Honour was considering certain kinds of future liabilities. In the present case, the subject matter calling for consideration is a potential future asset. That potential future asset is a bequest that becomes effective at some time in the future as a result of the death of the testator. Such bequests may have been in testamentary instruments which had been made prior to the merger date or may be in such instruments made after that date. In no sense could the subject matter of such bequests be regarded as property of either Achieve or Crowle in existence as at the merger date. Furthermore, looking at the matter prospectively from that date, the subject matter of such bequests could at best be described as contingent property.  The subject matter of Re Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849 ; 25 ACLC 208 was, of course, different from the subject matter of Order 6 and Order 7 in the present case.

In Re Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849 ; (2006) 25 ACLC 208 , Lindgren J made orders approving a scheme of arrangement which included the transfer of liabilities which might arise in the future from one Stork company to another arising out of future proceedings as defined in the scheme documentation . In that documentation, future proceedings was defined as: 
 
 Legal proceedings which have not yet commenced, but for which a cause of action has accrued or the injury or other event that may lead to a cause of action accruing (including, without limitation, exposure to asbestos dust) has occurred, or will occur in the future. 
 

  I do not think that either Bell Group Ltd (in liq) v Westpac Banking Corporation 18 WAR 21 or Elfic Ltd v Macks 162 FLR 41 determines the present question. However, the reasoning which underpins the judgment in Elfic Ltd v Macks 162 FLR 41 seems to me to be more in tune with the reasoning of Lindgren J in Re Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849 ; 25 ACLC 208 and is to be preferred. Reasoning along the lines of that deployed by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Elfic Ltd v Macks 162 FLR 41 would support the conclusion which I have expressed at [64] above. The definition of property in s 413 should be interpreted expansively. </sentence>

His Honour was considering the interests of asbestos claimants in connection with a scheme of arrangement which provided for all property of Stork ICM to be vested in Stork FSA. The property in question included ICM's contractual right to require insurers to indemnify it in respect of sums which it was, or might become, liable to pay to asbestos claimants as workers' compensation or common law damages. At [111] of his reasons his Honour said that in the course of the hearing he had indicated to the parties: 
 
 That I should not make the orders sought unless I was clearly satisfied that the potential claimants would be no worse off if the order were made than they would be otherwise.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 1556">The majority of the Schemes (17 companies) which are the subject of the present application involve the transfer of all the assets and liabilities of the transferor to another company in the Peabody group and the subsequent deregistration of the transferor. In the remaining cases the transfer will relate only to certain assets and/or liabilities of the transferor which will remain registered. There is nothing novel in any of these arrangements being recognised as schemes under Pt 5.2 of the Act nor is there anything unprecedented in any of the arrangements; see generally SCIG Insurance Ltd v Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 1492 , 51 ASCR 470 and Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd v Stork Food Systems Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1849. </sentence>
