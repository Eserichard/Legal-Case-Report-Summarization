<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1478">A factor which is bound up with the balance of convenience is the consideration that the ACCC is relieved by s 80(6) of the TPA from the requirement normally imposed on an applicant for interlocutory relief to give the usual undertaking as to damages. It is an open question whether that factor should be taken into account on the exercise of a discretion like the present. However, I prefer the view expressed in APM Investments Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1983) 49 ALR 475 , at 484 and 508 and ACCC v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 ; (2009) 253 ALR 324 , at 28 that the ACCC's immunity in this respect and its declining to offer an undertaking can be allowed a bearing on the discretion. I have, accordingly, given this factor some weight in deciding not to grant an interlocutory injunction. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1479">In considering whether the Court should grant interlocutory relief in respect of the payments to which I have referred, I will apply the principles which are ordinarily applied to the Court's consideration of applications for interlocutory injunctions.

In essence what is required is that the plaintiff establish that there is a serious question to be tried and that the balance of convenience and the balance of justice favour the grant of relief rather than the withholding of relief. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] VSC 476">44 In any event, the cases referred to make it clear that in considering what is unconscionable (and presumably unfair) it is necessary to undertake a careful and thorough analysis of the circumstances and conduct said to be unconscionable. There must be a process of reasoning. [29]  41 The respondents' counsel referred me to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster Pty Ltd, [24] where Gordon J at [17] adopted with approval the reasoning of Foster J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [25] where his Honour notes at [113] that the word "unconscionable" in s 51AC of the TPA is not limited to the meaning of the word according to the established principles of common law and equity and then cites with approval a number of authorities in support of this proposition. The authorities referred to by Foster J (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [26] and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [27] ) make it plain, it was submitted, that the factors listed in ss 51AA, 51AB and 51AC of the TPA do not limit the matters to which a Court may have regard and those matters fall outside specific equitable doctrines. However in my opinion, the cases do not go so far as to permit the Court to simply do anything it considers fair. </sentence>

His Honour's observations are equally applicable to s 51AB. At [113] his Honour said (citations omitted): 
 
 (a) The scope of s 51AC is wider than that of s 51AA. The meaning of unconscionable for the purposes of s 51AC is not limited to the meaning of the word according to established principles of common law and equity ...
 (b) The ordinary or dictionary meaning of unconscionable , which involves notions of serious misconduct or something which is clearly unfair or unreasonable, is picked up by the use of the word in s 51AC. When used in that section, the expression requires that the actions of the alleged contravenor show no regard for conscience, and be irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable. Inevitably the expression imports a pejorative moral judgment ...
 (c) Normally, some moral fault or moral responsibility would be involved. This would not ordinarily be present if the critical actions are merely negligent. There would ordinarily need to be a deliberate (in the sense of intentional) act or at least a reckless act ...

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] FMCA 67">To the extent that it might be necessary to particularise the unconscionability by making reference to these facts, I would allow the first respondent leave to amend, yet again, its Further Amended Response and Cross-Claim which needs some further work because in the form that has been filed reference has only been made to applicants and not to a respondent in paragraph 13. Having made the findings adumbrated above, I am now required to determine whether the actions of Top Plus constituted unconscionability and constituted a breach of s.51AC. Ms Rawlings in her helpful written submissions upon this topic commences by making reference to the recent decision of Foster J in ACCC v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 at [109-110] and [113-115]: "109 Section 51AC was introduced into Part IV of the TPA by the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Act 1998 (Cth). It came into effect on 1 July 1998. Sections 51AA and 51AB were already in the TPA as at 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCAFC 135">87 Allphones raise a similar complaint concerning the injunctive relief because once again it turns only on steps which group B members might take at a future time in relation to their franchise agreement. There is a further argument in relation to the unconscionable conduct claim which turns on alleged threats in relation to reducing or refusing the supply or distribution of stock. That complaint is that the allegations raised against Allphones are already the subject of injunctive orders made by Foster J in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 ; (2009) 253 ALR 324. On the basis that there is no evidence that Allphones is engaging in conduct which would contravene the orders made by his Honour, it is asserted by Allphones that the amendment permitting such claims to be made was not open and should not have been made.  88 This argument appears to overlook the fact that it is the franchisees themselves rather than the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) who are raising the claims and who seek to have the claims resolved not only on an interlocutory basis as, on Allphones' argument, has been achieved in Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 ; 253 ALR 324 but at trial by way of permanent injunction. The fact that interlocutory relief to that end has already been granted in another proceeding at the instance of another applicant, (the ACCC), does not preclude these franchisees being able to rely upon that conduct in support of relief which they would seek in their own favour. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCA 1075">In circumstances which I have described in two previous judgments delivered by me ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 ; (2009) 253 ALR 324 , [2009] ATPR 42-274 and Allphones Retail Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 980) , on 29 August 2008, by Notice of Dispute dated that day ( the Notice of Dispute ), Allphones commenced a dispute resolution process with approximately ninety of its franchisees with whom it was then in dispute.  In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 ; 253 ALR 324 , [2009] ATPR 42-274 , I dealt with an application for interlocutory injunctive relief made by the ACCC against Allphones in proceedings NSD 1567 of 2008. At [32]---[58] of that judgment, I described certain events leading up to the service of the Notice of Dispute. That description was based upon the evidence before me for the purposes of the application with which I was then dealing and, to some extent, may be controversial. But, allowing for these limitations, the description which I gave in those paragraphs of that judgment is a useful starting point for placing the Notice of Dispute into an appropriate context. Accordingly, I incorporate those paragraphs into these Reasons in order to provide some detail of the context in which the Notice of Dispute came to be issued. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FCA 980">Subsequently, in November 2008, in proceedings NSD 1567 of 2008, the ACCC made a further application for interim injunctive relief. The ACCC brought this second application for interlocutory relief in order to address further concerns which it had in relation to the conduct of Allphones in connection with its ongoing negotiations with its franchisees. On 19 January 2009, I delivered judgment in respect of that application ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 ; (2009) 253 ALR 324). This second interlocutory application is not presently relevant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FCA 849">The Group B members, it is said, raise existing claims of unconscionable conduct on the part of Allphones in threatening all franchisees that if they do not agree to execute Allphones' new franchise agreements, Allphones would require them to do so when they sought to renew their franchise agreements. Further, it is argued that the Group B members' claim is not hypothetical because they could have no confidence that Allphones would act in accordance with the Court's decision in the proceeding if they do not remain members of the represented class. It is argued that Allphones apparently seeks to re-litigate or at least not act consistently with all of the matters determined against it in Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 369 ; (2008) 167 FCR 314 in the current proceedings. See also Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 ; (2009) 253 ALR 324 , particularly at [121]-[122], [134] and [143]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FCA 682">Section 51AC has been the subject of limited judicial consideration. Most recently in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 Foster J summarised the relevant propositions in the following terms: Section 51AC was introduced into Part IV of the TPA by the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Act 1998 (Cth). It came into effect on 1 July 1998. Sections 51AA and 51AB were already in the TPA as at 1998. In my view, although Dukemaster's conduct was contrary to s 18 of the RTRA, it cannot be said that that conduct contravened s 51AC of the TPA. It was not irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable in the manner described by Foster J in Allphones Retail (No.2) [2009] FCA 17: see [17] above. (B) SECOND RENEWAL
