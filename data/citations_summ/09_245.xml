<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1369">The Authority may make plans of management under the FM Act. They are legislative instruments under the FM Act ( Lamason v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2009] FCA 245 at [149] - [150] per Spender J). The process by which plans of management are made and the information or material they may contain are dealt with in ss 17-20 inclusive of the FM Act. A plan of management is relevant in this case and it is the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery Management Plan 2003. The plan commenced on 1 October 2003 and it has been amended twice. I will refer to it as the Management Plan. </sentence>
