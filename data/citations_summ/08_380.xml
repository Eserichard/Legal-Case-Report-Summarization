<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1386">At the hearing on 17 March 2008 Ms Gray appeared for Mr Tiata and confirmed that her instructions were to discontinue the proceedings. She did not consent to the amount of costs being sought by the Minister. She explained that Mr Tiata would be unable to pay any costs which were ordered. For reasons which I explained in a judgment given on that day ( Tiata v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 380) I declined to order fixed costs and ordered that Mr Tiata pay the Minister's costs as taxed if not agreed. In due course, on 29 August 2008, a certificate of taxation was issued by a Deputy District Registrar certifying the Minister's costs at $4,800. However, notwithstanding that procedure, the proceedings were effectively at an end when the notice of discontinuance was filed on 17 March 2008. </sentence>
