<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 428">The question is whether, by use of the trade mark, there would be a contravention of the Trade Practices Act by a representation that, in all the circumstances, is made by Bavaria NV to a hypothetical ordinary and reasonable member of the class constituted by prospective purchasers of beer ( Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at [102] - [103]; Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 8) [2008] FCA 470 ; (2008) 75 IPR 557 at [89] ). Does the trade mark represent that the Bavaria NV beer originates in Bavaria or that it has a quality, reputation or other characteristic attributable to beer brewed in Bavaria? </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 8">By its notice of appeal, the appellant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd ("Cadbury") contends that orders of the primary judge (Heerey J) dismissing its action against Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd ("Darrell Lea") ( Cadbury Schweppes v Darrell Lea (No. 8) [2008] FCA 470 ; (2008) 75 IPR 557 ; (2008) ATPR 42-229) for relief in respect of contended misleading and deceptive conduct and passing off arising out of Darrell Lea's adoption of a colour purple similar to Cadbury purple in connection with its business and chocolate products, should be set aside and a new trial ordered because in the circumstances of the case, a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the primary judge might not bring an impartial and unbiased mind to the resolution of the questions he was required to decide at trial. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1172">2 The appellant ("Cadbury") appeals from a judgment of a judge of the Court dismissing an action for an injunction and damages for passing off and misleading or deceptive conduct: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 8) [2008] FCA 470 ; (2008) 75 IPR 557. </sentence>

Questions of costs remain to be resolved. The parties have filed written submissions, from which it appears that while there is acceptance that, in general, Darrell Lea should get its costs, some issues remain in dispute.
