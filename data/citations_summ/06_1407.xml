<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 38">There are a number of decisions of this Court where the formulation in Castlemaine Tooheys has been applied: see, for example, Aktiebolaget H&auml;ssle v Biochemie Australia Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 496 ; (2003) 57 IPR 1 at [29] ; Hexal Australia Pty Ltd v Roche Therapeutics Inc [2005] FCA 1218 ; (2005) 66 IPR 325 at [17] ; Pharmacia Italia SpA v Interpharma Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1675 ; (2005) 67 IPR 397 at [9] - [10] ; Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd (2006) 227 ALR 287 at [13]; Merck &amp; Co Inc v GenRx Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1407 ; (2006) 70 IPR 286 at [16] ; CSL Ltd v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1301 ; (2006) 70 IPR 128 at [58] - [59] ; Oxygen 8 Communications Australia Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2009] FCA 426 at [20] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 945">Gummow J's analysis has been applied by Moore J in Merck and Co Inc v GenRx Pty Ltd (2006) 70 IPR 286 ; [2006] FCA 1407 , Gyles J in GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis (2007) 73 IPR 502 ; [2007] FCA 1485 , Jessup J in Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents (2008) 79 IPR 261 ; [2008] FCA 1498 and, of course, Sundberg J in the Sigma decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 630">However, arguments similar to those advanced by Smith &amp; Nephew in this case to the effect that it now be allowed into the market pending a resolution of the patent dispute between the parties were rejected by Gyles J in GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 where his Honour said, at 506; 
 'I am much influenced by the effects of disturbing the status quo, particularly as it relates to the operation of the PBS. A new entrant in this field would have an effect which may be both unpredictable and irreversible. There is also likely to be interference with the trade patterns of Sanofi with its customers, both wholesale and retail, that may not be detectable or measurable in money terms... Temporary disturbance of that status quo is not justified. My view is consistent with that of Moore J in Merck &amp; Co Inc v Genrx Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1407 ; (2006) 70 IPR 286. ' 

  The authorities on this point speak with a single voice. Where a party enters into contracts or arrangements for supply which are contingent upon its successfully challenging the validity of an existing patent, it is no answer to an application for an interlocutory injunction for that party to say that arrangements are "already in place". Nor can that party be heard to complain that the grant of an interlocutory injunction would impinge adversely upon its standing or reputation in the market: see Merck &amp; Co Inc v GenRx Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1407 ; (2006) 70 IPR 286 , at 922 [19] per Moore J; Martin Engineering Co v Trison Holdings Pty Ltd (1988) 11 IPR 611 , per Gummow J, at 622; and Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 , at 626 per totam curiam . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 595">A similar situation existed in Interpharma [2008] FCA 1498 ; 79 IPR 261 where the alleged infringer had proceeded with its preparations to enter the market "with its eyes wide open". Jessup J said at [77] that this significantly compromised that party's attempt to resist an injunction which went no further than to maintain the status quo. See also Pharmacia Italia 67 IPR 397 at [38] and Merck &amp; Co Inc v GenRx Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1407 ; (2006) 70 IPR 286 at [19] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1498">15 The parties are in agreement that the questions which arise in an application for an interlocutory injunction such as the present are ---
 
(a) whether there is a serious question to be tried, or the cross-claimants have made out a prima facie case in the sense that, if the evidence remains the same, there is a probability that at trial they will be entitled to relief;
 
(b) whether the cross-claimants will suffer irreparable harm, for which damages will not be adequate compensation, unless an injunction is granted; and
 
(c) whether the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction. See Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 , 153; Aktiebologet Hassle v Biochemie Australia Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 496 ; (2003) 57 IPR 1 , 9 [29]; Hexal Australia Pty Ltd v Roche Therapeutics Inc [2005] FCA 1218 ; (2005) 66 IPR 325 , 328 [17]; Pharmacia Italia SpA v Interpharma Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1675 ; (2005) 67 IPR 397 , 399 [9]-[10]; Merck &amp; Co Inc v GenRx Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1407 ; (2006) 70 IPR 286 , 291 [16]. 77 This brings me to the cross-claimants' second reason for contending that the balance of convenience favoured the grant of an injunction. They submitted that the cross-respondent had got itself into its present situation with "its eyes wide open": see Merck &amp; Co Inc v GenRx Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1407 ; (2006) 70 IPR 286 , 292 [19]. The cross-respondent has undertaken all its commercial preparations in the knowledge of one or both of the patents, or at least had been less than assiduous in its inquiries as to whether the marketing by it if Gemcitabine EBEWE or of EBEGEMCIT might have constituted an infringement. The cross-claimants relied upon the reasons of Sundberg J in his reasons of 21 August 2008 ([2008] FCA 1283, [38]):
 
I agree with Lilly that the applicant's conduct with respect to its investigation of the extension decision demonstrates a marked lack of urgency at every stage. 72 As Gummow and Hayne JJ implied in ABC v O'Neill , the purpose of an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo pending trial (227 CLR at 82). In this respect, I am much attracted by the approach taken by Gyles J in GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis (73 IPR at 506 [15]):
 
However, I am much influenced by the effects of disturbing the status quo, particularly as it relates to the operation of the PBS. A new entrant in this field would have an effect which may be both unpredictable and irreversible. There is also likely to be interference with the trade patterns of Sanofi with its customers, both wholesale and retail, that may not be detectable or measurable in money terms. Sanofi has built up a considerable trade since 2003, and the establishment to go with it, as GenRx looked on. Temporary disturbance of that status quo is not justified. My view is consistent with that of Moore J in Merck &amp; Co Inc v GenRx Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1407 ; (2006) 70 IPR 286.... </sentence>
