<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] MRTA 946">When determining whether "exceptional reasons" have been established, the decision maker must assume that the visa applicant should not be granted the visa unless some reasons can be positively identified which justify, in the mind of the decision maker, the grant of the visa. Beyond such reasons being capable of being described as "exceptional" in "ordinary parlance", there is no prescriptive definition of the term. The decision maker has a "nearly unfettered discretion" to consider the particular circumstances of the case, and to consider whether the applicant should be made an exception to a ban on the grant of the visa in Australia. ( Kim v MIAC [2008] FMCA 1577 (Smith FM, 27 November 2008) at [30], undisturbed on appeal - Kim v MIAC [2009] FCA 161 (Buchanan J, 26 February 2009). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 238">I recently attempted to analyse the assessment level scheme, in an effort to discern the policy background to the distinctions made between different applicants depending upon their assessment levels, i.e. their country of origin (see Kim v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1577). My analysis of that background was not disapproved on appeal by Buchanan J (see Kim v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 161). I was unable usefully to discern the underlying policy distinctions from the language or structure of the migration regulations, nor from the extrinsic material, so as to give a focused content to a power of exemption from the exclusion of some assessment level 2, 3, 4 and 5 applicants under cl.573.227, which is identical to a criterion also applicable to subclass 572 visa applicants. I concluded that the draftsman would not have intended that the language of these criteria should be construed by reference to underlying policies explaining the different requirements placed on visa applicants based on their assessment level. Decision-makers, and a court on judicial review, are left with the language of the regulations and the surrounding legislative context, when endeavouring to find their intended meaning. </sentence>
