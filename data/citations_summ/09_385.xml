<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1146">The obligation of the AAT to give reasons was recently summarised by Edmonds J in Sagigi v Comcare [2009] FCA 385 in the following terms: 
 
 [17] Similar observations were more recently made by Flick J in Comcare v Davies (2008) 173 IR 294 at [31] and [32]: 
 

 
 
 
 31 ...The nature and extent of this obligation [under s 43(2B) of the AAT Act] has been extensively canvassed. For the purposes of the resolution of the present appeal it is sufficient to note that the reasons of the Tribunal are "meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed": Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; [1996] 185 CLR 259 at 272. But it is equally important "to review the Tribunal's reasons to be satisfied that the Tribunal has in fact had regard to the matters which it must address": Zhang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 30 at [14] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1072">The applicant asserts, in his notice of appeal, that the Tribunal failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision declining to hold that it had jurisdiction in the matter. Section 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (the AAT Act) obliges the Tribunal to include in its written reasons its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based. In my judgment, the Tribunal's reasons amply indicate why it made the decision which it did. The relevant legal principle to assess the adequacy of reasons has recently been discussed, together with a number of authorities, in Sagigi v Comcar [2009] FCA 385. In this matter, the Tribunal's reasons indicate the material upon which it made its decision that it did not have jurisdiction, it referred to the relevant statutory provisions, and explained its understanding of those provisions, and why it reached the decision which it did. In my view, there is no failure on the part of the Tribunal to comply with s 43(2B) of the AAT Act. </sentence>
