<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 1050">The Federal Court's decision in Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2009] FCA 1514 reminds us that the Tribunal must conscientiously observe the provisions in a statute which confer jurisdiction. I accept that the provisions referred to by the respondent have the contended effect. It follows the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to deal with Ms Froeemcke's application. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 253">As a preliminary matter, I have to decide whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to review the decision not to vary the period of accreditation which, in this case, is two years. I am mindful that a similar issue came before Senior Member McCabe in Brisbane who found that the AAT had jurisdiction. However in the appeal from Senior McCabe's decision, Collier J, in Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2009] FCA 1514 , ( Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd v Administrative Appeals Tribunal ) held that the AAT does not have jurisdiction to review a decision made pursuant to section 2.32 of the Principles not to vary a period of accreditation made under section 7.1 of the Principles. </sentence>
