<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 450">In Uniline Australia Ltd v SBriggs Pty Ltd (No 2) and Anor [2009] FCA 920 , Greenwood J referred to several authorities which considered circumstances where an offeree who rejects a genuine offer to compromise would not incur an award of indemnity costs: see Uniline at [46]-[50]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCAFC 53">In Uniline Australia Ltd v S Briggs Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2009] FCA 920 , Greenwood J noted at [38]: 
 
 In the modern world of commercial litigation and various subsets of that litigation such as intellectual property litigation, costs are a very real and quantifiable concern. It would be extremely odd to think otherwise. Costs are incurred in a recoverable inter-parties sense from the moment the proceedings issue and they continue to be incurred at every point along the continuum of the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 283">An offer of compromise, properly so called does exist where a party is prepared to pay some money (albeit small) and otherwise the parties 'walk away': see Granitgard Pty Ltd v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd (No 6) [2010] FCA 381 at [22] and [23], where reference was made to the decision of Finkelstein J in Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd (No 4) [2009] FCA 803 ; and the decision of Greenwood J in Uniline Australia Ltd v SBriggs Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 920 ; (2009) 82 IPR 56. In addition, in these proceedings, it is important to remember that the respondents, by way of cross-claim, wanted positive relief by way of rectification. The respondents were offering not to press the litigation any further (which would involve associated costs and management time on the part of the applicant), if the applicant agreed to rectification. I accept that by this time, having regard to the history of the applicant's use of the trade mark, to accept the offers would have been a great step for the applicant. However, I see no basis to conclude that the offer was not a genuine attempt to bring the proceedings to an end in the way in which the public policy of O 23 r 11(6) encourages. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 1018">The expression "unless a court otherwise orders" in o.23 r.11(6) of the Federal Court Rules permits the Court to depart from the presumptive rule. However, the Court must be satisfied there are "compelling and exceptional circumstances" before it would permit a departure from the conventional approach: Futuretronics.com.au Pty Ltd v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 40 at [10] . Even if the Applicant acted reasonably in rejecting the offer, it is insufficient to displace the operation of the rule: Futuretronics.com.au Pty Ltd v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (supra) at [11]; Uniline Australia Ltd v S BriggsPty Ltd (No.2) [2009] FCA 920 ; (2009) 82 IPR 56 at [45] --- [48]. </sentence>

In some circumstances, however, the Court has held that the successful party (for example, the alleged patent infringer) should pay the unsuccessful party's costs on a particular issue (for example, the patentee's costs of a cross-claim relating to allegations of lack of novelty, lack of inventive step and false suggestion) because that party has not succeeded on the cross-claim in respect of those issues.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 415">In Uniline Australia Ltd v SBriggs Pty Ltd (No. 2) (2009) 82 IPR 56 ; [2009] FCA 920 , I put these considerations in the following terms at [38]: 
 
 In the modern world of commercial litigation and various subsets of that litigation such as intellectual property litigation, costs are a very real and quantifiable concern. It would be extremely odd to think otherwise. Costs are incurred in a recoverable inter-parties sense from the moment the proceedings issue and they continue to be incurred at every point along the continuum of the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FCA 381">As a matter of language, the current O 23 r 11(6) describes a position which will apply unless the Court otherwise orders. That qualification necessarily implies that there must be a basis arising from the circumstances of a particular case for the Court "otherwise ordering". In turn, because it will be in an applicant's interest so to do, it further implies that an applicant must evidence something in those circumstances which is submitted to provide a basis for "otherwise ordering". If an applicant does this, the Court must make a value judgment, taking into account that evidence, as to how the costs discretion should be exercised. I did not, in the end, understand Granitgard to contend for any different construction of the current rule. However, insofar as Granitgard's submission carried with it, in respect of the current rule, any suggestion that a sufficient basis for "otherwise ordering" was to be found just in demonstrating that it had a reasonable case and had acted reasonably in not accepting the second offer, I reject that submission. To so view the construction of the rule would be inconsistent with the weight of the authorities collected and discussed by Greenwood J in Uniline Australia Ltd v SBriggs Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 920 ; (2009) 82 IPR 56 (Uniline) at [45] to [48]. The better view in respect of the current rule is that to "order otherwise", compelling and exceptional circumstances must be shown and that this is not done just by showing that the offeree had a reasonable case and had acted reasonably in rejecting the offer. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 1137">It is well established that cost consequences apply only where an offer of compromise represents what the Court construes as a genuine attempt at compromise (see G E Dal Pont, Law of Costs, 2 nd ed (2009), 13.7). This principle applies whether the offer is made for the purposes of a Calderbank letter of offer or an offer of compromise under the rules of Court: Uniline Australia Ltd v SBriggs Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2009] FCA 920. In Uniline the applicant sought a declaration that threats of patent infringement proceedings made by the respondent were unjustifiable, injunctions to prevent further threats and damages arising out of those threats. In its cross claim, the respondent sought a declaration of patent infringement, an order for delivery up of all infringing products and damages.</sentence>
