However, the decided cases (including those under comparable provisions of the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth)), reveal that a critical consideration is whether affected policy holders will be detrimentally affected by the implementation of the scheme: see Re Insurance Australia Limited [2004] FCA 524 ; (2004) 139 FCR 450 at [76] ; PMI Indemnity Limited (No 2) [2005] FCA 1842 at [24] ; In the Application of Budget Insurance Company Ltd and Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Ltd [2008] FCA 636 at [13] .
