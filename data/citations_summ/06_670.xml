<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 408">The risk of Shareholders suffering a delay or default in payment of the Scheme Consideration is adequately addressed by the timing of payments described above. As the issue of C Class shares and the transfer of shares will not occur until Ebro has made the necessary payments as described above, Shareholders are protected from such delays or default; Re SFE Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 670 , (2006) 59 ACSR 82 at [4] and Re APN News &amp; Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [23] . Although Ebro has guaranteed performance of its obligations under the Scheme by delivery to SunRice of an executed Deed Poll in favour of SunRice Shareholders, the timing of payments and transfers is such that Shareholders are unlikely to have to rely on that guarantee. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] VSC 4">An alternative safeguard in relation to the cash portion of the payment would be to set aside a trust fund immediately before the vesting of the shares in the acquiring company. I do not see why shareholders whose shares are divested should run any performance risk so far as the quid pro quo is concerned. " 
 

On the scheme returning to the Court for approval, Gyles J commented: [22] 
 
 
 " [3] I drew attention on that occasion to a question which arises as to the means of enforcing arrangements such as these, including (although not restricted to) issues about solvency. I am satisfied by the evidence that there is both the capacity to meet the obligations which are being undertaken and willingness on the part of those involved to do so. Indeed, there is every reason for them to do so. 25 In my opinion, the framework of provisions to which reference has been made effectively eliminates the risk identified by Gyles J in Re SFE Corporation Ltd [25] that shareholders who have already transferred their shares will be at risk of delay or default by the acquiring company; and, similarly, with respect to the cancellation of rights. Additionally, a clear mechanism for the enforcement of the obligations of the acquiring company on behalf of the minority shareholders and the Rightsholders is provided by this framework. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that there is no undue risk to minority shareholders or Rightsholders such that the scheme should not go forward for consideration by them. 
 
  21 In Re SFE Corporation Ltd, the issue of performance risk was addressed by Gyles J: [21] 
 
 
 " [4] The obligations of ASX, in particular in relation to the Scheme consideration, are backed up by an executed deed poll as is the case in many such schemes. I have remarked in other cases (eg Re KAZ Group Ltd [2004] FCA 738 ) that this procedure is not entirely satisfactory as, in the event of default or delay, the shareholder whose shares have been actually acquired is left with the remedy of suing upon a deed poll. It may be that in this case the practical risk is slight.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1309">I was of the view that the above provisions meant scheme shareholders were adequately protected against any credit or performance risk ( Re SFE Corp Ltd [2006] FCA 670 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 82 ; Re APN News and Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 (" Re APN News and Media "); Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1186).

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1189">The only other issue which arose was the issue of performance risk. That is an issue which has been considered in a number of decisions of the Court, including the decisions of Gyles J in Re KAZ Group Limited [2004] FCA 738 at [4] --- [5] and Re SFE Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 670 (" SFE ") at [4]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] VSC 560">2) [21] Gyles J stated that he would only be inclined to refrain from ordering a meeting if the amount of the break fee was such that it could influence voting at the meeting or if there were some other unusual circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 180">The details of the break fee are addressed in the affidavit of Mr Barry John Hamilton, who is the non-executive Chairman of People. Importantly, the break fee is not payable if the proposed scheme is not approved by the shareholders, thus it cannot be said to be a matter which could influence voting at the scheme meeting: see Re SFE Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 670 per Gyles J at [6] to [7]; see also Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [43] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1901">20. The provisions for payment by Oracle of the cash consideration, prior to the transfer of shares and cancellation of the options is a safeguard against the risk that shareholders, noteholders and optionholders will suffer delay or default in the provision of the scheme consideration after their memberships or options have been cancelled. They will not be relegated to the remedy of suing on the deed poll [5] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1839">10 I was satisfied that the break fee provision did not offend the principles stated in the authorities including Re SFE Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 670 at [6] --- [7].</sentence>

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] VSC 394">42 Mr Santamaria submitted that in a number of recent decisions, courts considering applications under subsection 411(1) in relation to schemes of acquisition have directed attention to what has been called the "performance risk". As Gyles J in the Federal Court has put it: [14] 
 
It seems to me, however, that schemes of this kind would be more acceptable if a procedure be devised whereby a mechanism were built in by which a third party such as a trustee company would have the role of suing on behalf of former shareholders in the target company. An alternative safeguard in relation to the cash portion of the payment would be to set aside a trust fund immediately before the vesting of the shares in the acquiring company. I do not see why shareholders whose shares are divested should run any performance risk so far as the quid pro quo is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] VSC 389">65 Mr Bathurst submitted that in Re SFE Corporation Limited [28] Gyles J observed that clauses providing for the payment of break fees would not prevent the making of orders convening a meeting of shareholders to consider a proposed scheme of arrangement, unless the break fee were such that it could influence voting at the meeting, or if there were some other unusual circumstance. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FCA 1104">19 In SFE [2006] FCA 670 ; 59 ACSR 82 , Gyles J suggested that a scheme might provide for payment by the acquiring company to a trustee prior to the vesting of title to the shares in the acquiring company, to be held by the trustee for payment to the shareholders immediately following the vesting. In my experience, this procedure is now commonly followed, as it has been in the present case. 18 Morgan Stanley Bidco has executed a Deed Poll by which it has covenanted in favour of the Scheme Participants (the holders of Securities other than Excluded Securities) to carry out the obligations to be performed by it under the Share Scheme and the Unit Scheme. In a series of cases, Gyles J has noted that notwithstanding such a deed poll, it is unsatisfactory that persons whose shares have been acquired should have no remedy for non-performance by the acquiring company other than to sue it on the deed poll: see Re Kaz Group Ltd [2004] FCA 738 ; Re Tempo Services Ltd [2005] FCA 411 ; (2005) 53 ACSR 526 ; Re SFE Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 670 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 82 ( SFE) .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FCA 770">23 A concern raised in previous scheme of arrangement applications in this Court is that shareholders may be left in a position, once a scheme has become effective, where their shares have been transferred but where there is a delay in the provision of the Scheme Consideration and where their only remedy is to sue on the deed poll (see Re KAZ Group Ltd [2004] FCA 738 at [4] - [5]; Re Tempo Services Ltd [2005] FCA 410 ; (2005) 53 ACSR 523 at [5] - [6] ; Re SFE Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 670 at [4] ; and Re Brambles Industries Ltd (2006) 59 ACSR 501 at [9]). Such "performance risk" has been addressed here by requiring that the Scheme Consideration be paid to APN before 8.00 am on the implementation date to be held by it in trust for the purpose of being paid, free of deductions, to the Scheme participants before they are divested of their shares in APN later on the implementation date. This is provided for in the Deed Poll. Disadvantages and Risks  43 Provisions for the payment of break fees are not uncommon in agreements for schemes of arrangements and in merger and takeover agreements, both in Australia and overseas. Such provisions have not been an obstacle to the making of orders under s 411(1) of the Act for the convening of meetings. In Re SFE Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 670 at [6] - [7], Gyles J said that he would be dissuaded from making an order by a break fee only if the amount was of such magnitude that it could influence voting or if there were some other unusual circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCA 314">19 There is no risk of a failure of performance by Fairfax, because the provision for payment on the business day prior to the Implementation Date and for the registering of Rural Press shareholders in the Register of Members on the Implementation Date, eliminate the possibility that Scheme Shareholders may have ceased to own their shares in Rural Press before receiving the Scheme consideration, and be left to suing Fairfax for it: cf Re KAZ Group Ltd [2004] FCA 738 at [4] , [5]; Re Tempo Services Ltd [2005] FCA 410 ; (2005) 53 ACSR 523 at [5] , [6]; Re SFE Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 670 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 82 at [4] ; Re Brambles Industries Ltd (2006) 59 ACSR 501 at [9].

<sentence id="cs14" from="[2006] FCA 1772">I am satisfied that the structure of the scheme is effective and appropriately safeguards the interests of shareholders in the event that the scheme is approved. It effectively removes the performance risk to which I have referred in other cases (eg Re SFE Corporation Ltd (2006) 59 ACSR 82 ; [2006] FCA 670 ; Re Tempo Services Ltd [2005] FCA 410 ; (2005) 53 ACSR 523 at 524; [2005] FCA 410). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2006] FCA 937">His Honour said (at [5]):
 "The one matter to which I have drawn to attention of counsel is that, as a matter of principle, my view is that the security holders whose securities are divested by virtue of a scheme such as this should not have to bear any credit risk occasioned by the mechanism chosen so far as payment is concerned. " 
 

In Tempo , the point was met by a provision for payment of the consideration into a Quistclose trust (cf Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd [1970] AC 567). 
 8 His Honour most recently considered the issue in SFE Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 670 (" SFE ") at [4]. Indeed, counsel has provided me with a copy of the scheme in SFE , which was, like the present Scheme, an acquisition for cash and shares. More accurately, it provided for an election between a Share Alternative and a Cash and Share Alternative.</sentence>
