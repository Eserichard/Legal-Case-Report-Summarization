<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 531">
 4 Order 29 r 2 is most commonly used to allow the Court to resolve preliminary issues or questions, which, once resolved, mean it is unnecessary for the Court to resolve other issues or questions in the proceeding. In such circumstances, splitting the trial can save the Court and the parties the time and expense of dealing with ultimately redundant issues. Here, the respondent's liability for all applicants' claims and quantum of the first applicant's claim could not be described as preliminary issues or questions. However, that does not mean they cannot be determined separately from the quantum of the second applicants' claims. Indeed, it is even possible for an order under O 29 r 2 to be made 'after the event' of the trial, where the Court has only, at that stage, dealt with issues of liability; see Council of the City of Sydney v Goldspar Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 641 at [5] to [6] per Gyles J. </sentence>
