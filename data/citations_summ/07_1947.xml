<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 482">The insured argued that the views of the majority in McCarney 16 MVR 34 on s 4E(13) were part of the ratio decidendi based on what Finkelstein J said in McBride v Monzil [2007] FCA 1947 ; (2007) 164 FCR 559 at 562-563 [6] - [7]. I do not understand his Honour to have said that where a court or a majority of judges expresses a ground for the orders made but goes on to express a view on other matters argued that were not stated to be essential to the orders, that those view form part of the ratio. Such a conclusion is contrary to the authorities in the High Court to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 445">In McBride v Monzie Pty Ltd and Others [2007] FCA 1947 ; (1997) 164 FCR 559 Finkelstein J at [21] repeated the statement he made in Bright v Femcare Ltd and Another (2003] [2002] FCAFC 243 ; 195 ALR 574 at 606 and said: 
 
 I said in that case that if the applicants and the group members were not permitted to bring a group claim it was likely that many of them would not pursue an individual claim because the potential gain would not justify incurring the risk of costs. I said that in that sense it would be contrary to the interests of justice to make an order under s 33N. This is an even stronger case, due to the quantum of the individual damages claims, where stopping the group proceeding would work a serious injustice.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] WASCA 61">41 However, this statement must be read in the light of the doctrine of stare decisis or the rule of precedent which is that a lower court should follow decisions of higher courts and that intermediate courts should follow earlier decisions of its own, and those of courts of coordinate jurisdiction, unless they are plainly wrong. The 'decision' which has to be followed is the ratio decidendi of the earlier decision: McBride v Monzie Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1947 ; (2007) 164 FCR 559 [4] - [6]; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co v F H Faulding &amp; Co Ltd [2000] FCA 316 ; (2000) 97 FCR 524 [148]. The ratio is the reason why the court made the order that it did in the resolution of a dispute between parties: Bristol-Myers [148] - [149]. The traditional view is that obiter dictum does not have to be followed. See Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co Ltd [1944] KB 718. This may have to be qualified in relation to High Court decisions. See Farah Constructions [134].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 939">20 In McBride v Monzie Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1947 Finkelstein J said at [6]:
 The ratio of a case is the ruling on a point of law upon which the judge acts to reach his (or her) conclusion: Cross &amp; Harris, Precedent in English Law (4th ed, 1990) at 72. If a judge gives two or more alternative reasons for reaching his (or her) decision each reason is part of the ratio ... Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co v F H Faulding &amp; Co Ltd [2000] FCA 316 ; (2000) 97 FCR 524 , 570-571. There may be some cases where the judge gives additional reasons but indicates that he does not wish them to be part of the ratio and is merely wanting to have his views recorded for the benefit of those who may later be required to consider the point. In that event, what the judge says is not part of the ratio: Behrens v Bertram Mills Circus Ltd [1957] 2 QB 1 , 25. </sentence>
