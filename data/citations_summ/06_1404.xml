<citphrase id="cp20.0" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">somewhat surprisingly, mr koutsoupias saw fit to respond to the husband's assertions. he swore an affidavit on 25 october 2010. in his affidavit, mr koutsoupias disagreed with certain aspects of the husband's description of the conference that took place on 21 september 2009</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.1" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">but the following, at least, is clear: mr koutsoupias conferred with the husband and the wife together. the purpose of the conference was to discuss issues relating to the preparation of a will. the ownership of property p was discussed. mr koutsoupias obtained a search of the title to property p. the fact that the husband's sister and niece were registered proprietors of property p (with the husband and the wife) was discussed. a degree of tension arose during the course of the conference. the conference was terminated without mr koutsoupias receiving instructions to prepare a will for either party. mr koutsoupias said that the wife telephoned him a few days after the conference and asked him to represent her in relation to family law proceedings. he also said that: he told the wife that he would only represent her "with the consent of her husband"; he rang the husband on 6 october 2009 and told the husband that the wife had asked him to represent her; during the telephone call, he asked the husband "for his consent, which he gave without hesitation, saying that he was happy that (the wife) had retained (mr koutsoupias) as her solicitor as she would find it very difficult to find another greek speaking practitioner"; and other matters were discussed during the telephone call. the husband's affidavit sworn 11 october 2010 annexes a letter dated 21 october 2009 from his solicitors to mr koutsoupias. the letter raises "the potential conflict of interest" and continues: ... we will not correspond with you in relation to family law matters beyond making arrangements for the collection of our clients effects, until the law institute of victoria ethics committee has provided us with a ruling in relation to your continuing involvement; a ruling which we are in the process of requesting. in his affidavit, mr koutsoupias asserted that the husband "has attempted to delay proceedings and make this matter as difficult as possible for (the wife)", and that part of the delaying process involved a failure on the husband's part to obtain the relevant ruling from the law institute of victoria ethics committee. the fact of the matter is, however, that mr koutsoupias also foresaw the potential for a conflict of interest to arise. in paragraph 22 of his affidavit, he deposed as follows: when (the husband) first raised the issue of conflict with his solicitors, i immediately indicated to them that i would be prepared to abide by a ruling by professional standards of the law institute, as i had terminated the conference immediately i foresaw the potential for a conflict to arise. suffice it to say (at this stage) that: there is no reason why mr koutsoupias could not have sought an appropriate ruling from the law institute of victoria, if he felt discomfort with the position in which he found himself; and mr koutsoupias' affidavit sets up a clear conflict between his version of the events that occurred at the conference on 21 september 2009 (including statements or concessions allegedly made by the husband in mr koutsoupias' and the wife's presence) and the husband's version of those events. the husband replies  the husband swore a further affidavit on 9 november 2010. in it, he joined issue with mr koutsoupias regarding a number of matters dealt with in mr koutsoupias' affidavit. of most significance are the following: the husband reaffirmed that</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.2" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">"the wife has always known that (the husband's sister and niece) are registered proprietors of (property p) because the wife was told by me and it was agreed when (property p) was purchased that (they) would be joint proprietors"; and "the wife and i together with (the husband's sister and niece) attended the conveyancing solicitors' office to execute the transfer documents". the husband denied that mr koutsoupias asked him for his consent to represent the wife. he said that he did not provide mr koutsoupias with his consent. the law  there is no absolute rule that a legal practitioner who has acted for a client in a particular matter must not act against that client in the same or any other matter. [3] it has been said, however, that there are three possible grounds for restraining a legal practitioner from acting for a party to litigation: [4] the inherent jurisdiction or implied power of the court to supervise and control the conduct of legal practitioners as officers of the court (in order to safeguard the due administration of justice); a breach of a supposed fiduciary duty of loyalty not to act against a client, or against a former client, in the same matter or a closely related matter; and the danger of misuse of confidential information. i shall refer to the first of the above grounds as "the supervision and control ground". i shall refer to the second and third grounds as "the duty of loyalty ground" and "the confidential information ground" respectively. an application to restrain a legal practitioner from acting for a party to litigation must be made without delay, and failure to take the point at an early stage might well cast doubt on the validity of any subsequent complaint. [5] the supervision and control ground leaving aside any questions relating to whether this court has inherent jurisdiction, as opposed to "an implied incidental power to make orders necessarily incidental to express powers", [6] the test to be applied in relation to the supervision and control ground seems to be "whether a fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that a legal practitioner should be prevented from acting</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.3" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">in the interests of the protection of the integrity of the judicial process and the due administration of justice (including the appearance of justice)". [7] such jurisdiction or power as is inherent in the supervision and control ground should be regarded as exceptional, and must be exercised with caution, [8] with "due weight" being given to the public interest in a litigant not being deprived of his or her lawyer of choice without a good reason. [9] in state of western australia v ward and ors, [10] the full court of the federal court said: [11] ... the requirements of natural justice do not involve an absolute right to the legal adviser of a party's choice. the instances in which courts have prevented chosen counsel or solicitors from acting have involved misconduct, potential use of confidential information, and a real risk of lack of objectivity and of conflict of interest and duty ... the present case (i.e. state of western australia v ward) is only another example of situations in which the "integrity of the judicial process", the "interests of justice" and the "need to preserve confidence in the judicial system", to use some of the notions that lie behind the inherent jurisdiction to exclude counsel or solicitors, may override the public interest that a litigant be able to be represented by the lawyer of its choice. that public interest is "an important value". ... it is a serious matter to prevent a party from retaining its chosen lawyer. ... but ... particular circumstances may require some modification of the public interest in the ability of a litigant to have a lawyer of its choice. it is, of course, settled law that legal practitioners have duties to the court, as well as duties to their clients, and that the former necessarily override the latter. [12] put another way, a legal practitioner's duty to the client is subordinate to his or her duty to the court</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.4" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">which duty remains paramount even if the client gives instructions to the contrary. [13] indeed, unlike a legal practitioner's duty to a client (which can be waived or ratified by a properly informed and advised client who is not under any disability), a legal practitioner's duty to the court cannot be waived. [14] . the practical implications of legal practitioners' overriding or paramount duties to the court were described by heenan j in holborow v macdonald rudder : [15] if there are circumstances which are likely to imperil the discharge of these duties to a court by a legal practitioner acting in a cause, whether because of some prior association with one or more of the parties against whom the practitioner is then to act, or because of some conduct by the practitioner, whether arising from associations with the client or a close interest which gives rise to the fair and reasonable perception that the practitioner may not exercise the necessary independent judgment, a court may conclude that the lawyer should be restrained from acting, even for a client who desires to continue his service. the inherent jurisdiction or implied incidental power referred to in the supervision and control ground has been invoked in cases where there was a potential that the legal practitioner might become a witness in the proceedings, and where the subject matter of litigation was likely to involve an evaluation of the legal practitioner's conduct. [16] it has also been held that it may be appropriate to invoke the jurisdiction or power in a case where the practitioner might feel impelled to justify or defend his or her conduct in representing a client, or where the legal practitioner's credibility could be at stake. [17] the potential misuse of information which might not comfortably be described as "confidential information" also falls within this general category. for example, legal practitioners can often learn a great deal about a client's personality, weaknesses or strengths, honesty (or perhaps dishonesty), fears and reactions (including reactions to pressure or tension). similarly, legal practitioners can learn much about a client's attitude and approach to litigation. in yunghanns v elfic ltd , [18] gillard j described these considerations as "getting to know you" factors. in a case where a former client's credibility becomes a matter of significance, his or her former legal practitioner's knowledge of the "getting to know you" factors can become a powerful weapon at the disposal of the practitioner's new client. irrespective of the actual effectiveness of the weapon, it can be anticipated that the former client would feel anxiety about the potential of being cross examined by a practitioner who might be perceived as being in a position of unfair superiority</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.5" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">&#9472; or by counsel instructed by such a practitioner. [19] in black v taylor , [20] for example, richardson j. said (in the context of proceedings involving a family solicitor potentially acting for the estate of a deceased family member in proceedings brought against it by another family member): ... it would not be unreasonable for a family member to feel chagrin and concern to find a lawyer who had built up knowledge of that kind was able consciously or unconsciously to draw on it when acting against (the family member). in mcmillan , [21] the full court adopted the following passage from the minority judgment of the supreme court of canada in martin v macdonald estate (gray), [22]</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.6" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">which was a decision (although not in the family law jurisdiction) dealing with an employed solicitor changing firms: in preparing for the hearing of a contentious matter, a client will often be required to reveal to the lawyer retained highly confidential information. the client's most secret devices and desires, the client's most frightening fears, will often, of necessity, be revealed. the client must be secure in the knowledge that the lawyer will neither disclose nor take advantage of these revelations. our judicial system could not operate if this were not the case. it cannot function properly if doubt or suspicion exists in the mind of the public that the confidential information disclosed by a client to a lawyer might be revealed. it is very important, however, not to elevate the significance of the "getting to know you" factors. indeed, it is crucial to evaluate and inform their relevance in the broader context of the inherent jurisdiction or implied power of the court to supervise and control the conduct of legal practitioners as officers of the court (in order to safeguard the due administration of justice). thus, and as heerey j said in mintel international group limited v mintel (australia) pty ltd : [23] insofar as reliance is placed on the "getting to know you" principle, a moment's consideration of the way that litigation is conducted in australia shows that this cannot be accepted too literally, especially in relation to counsel. there are many bodies such as commonwealth and state government entities, banks, insurers, media companies and many others which are constantly engaged in litigation. counsel retained to act on behalf of such bodies inevitably acquire information, not confidential information in the strict sense, but experience as to the corporate culture of the clients, their internal policies, the way they deal with litigation, tactics, the personalities of important decision-makers and so forth. i do not accept that general experience of that kind would impose what presumably on the respondent's argument would be lifetime restraints on counsel from acting against such a body. indeed it is a feature of an independent bar that counsel might appear one day on behalf of such a body and the next day against it. while perhaps strange to observers from countries where the legal profession is organised differently, this freedom enhances the independence of counsel and their capacity to give objective and sometimes unwelcome advice. the cab rank rule works both ways. the driver is obliged to accept the fare, but the fare does not buy the service of the driver beyond the stipulated journey. the duty of loyalty ground it is likely that any supposed fiduciary duty of loyalty owed by a legal practitioner to his/her client does not survive the termination of the retainer. in ismail-zai v the state of western australia (2007) waca 150 , steytler p said: 23. in my opinion, the weight of authority currently supports the proposition that the duty of loyalty does not survive the termination of the retainer. moreover, some of the cases which support the existence of a continuing duty of loyalty seem ... to draw no clear distinction between a fiduciary obligation of that kind, on the one hand, and the court's inherent supervisory jurisdiction to protect the integrity of the judicial process, on the other. ... 24. in any event, ... there may be little distinction, for any practical purpose, between the question whether there is a breach of the continuing duty of loyalty, on the one hand, and the question is whether there is a real risk of a breach of confidence and whether there is or will be other impropriety of a kind that is likely to undermine the integrity of the judicial process and the due administration of justice (which comprehends the appearance of justice), on the other hand. ... i find it difficult to envisage circumstances in which a lawyer who acts in the same or a closely related matter against a former client will neither be in a position in which there is a real risk of a breach of duty of confidence nor be acting in such a way as to undermine the integrity of the judicial process or the due administration of justice. i agree with the above analysis, and conclude that the second ground for restraining a legal practitioner from acting against a former client (being the duty of loyalty ground) is, in essence, a restatement of the first and third grounds (being the supervision and control ground and the confidential information ground) in omnibus form. put another way: ... because of the frequent recourse to the term "duty of loyalty" ..., it is necessary to emphasise that that eloquent, but elastic, term is not itself precise. the measure of the obligation upon the former (legal practitioner) should not be deduced from that description alone but, rather, from an examination of the principles on which courts have acted to regulate or restrict actual or anticipated conduct of former legal advisers. [24] the confidential information ground generally speaking, cases dealing with applications to restrain a legal practitioner from acting in family law proceedings have focused on the confidential information ground, and less frequently on the duty of loyalty ground. the leading authority is the decision of the full court in mcmillan [2000] famca 1046. [25] the confidential information ground, and the effect of mcmillan , were summarised by o'ryan j in pond &amp; thurga (no 2) : [26] prior to (mcmillan) it was uncertain whether a narrow test of actual prejudice (arising from the possible misuse of confidential information) or the broader test of theoretical risk of prejudice was to be applied. ... the full court ultimately adopted the broad approach in mills v day dawn block gold mining company ltd [27] and thevanaz [28] of a theoretical risk of prejudice rather than proof of actual prejudice. the full court found that the narrow or english approach which requires 'real mischief or prejudice' to follow in order to justify court intervention (an approach stemming from rakusen v ellis, munday &amp; clarke [29] ) was inappropriate for the family law jurisdiction. the full court ... cited with approval the summary of the law provided by lindenmayer j in stewart (unreported, 17 april 1997): all that is necessary is that the wife swears that she has conveyed confidential information to the solicitors and that she believes, not unreasonably, that that information may be used against her, or at least to her disadvantage, in these current proceedings. his honour continued: [30] importantly, the adoption of the stricter approach in the family law jurisdiction was borne out of cases concerning practitioners that had acted for both husband and wife and reasons specific to this factual situation. in these cases the reasons for adopting this test have been based on the sensitive nature of the jurisdiction and the in-depth factual inquiries that the court was often required to make into parties' financial history, conduct and contributions. ... although the full court in mcmillan did not (itself) summarise the test to be applied when deciding whether or not to restrain a legal practitioner from acting for a party to litigation on the basis of the confidential information ground, it is clear that its elements are as follows: the party seeking the restraint ("the complainant") must: raise a prima facie case that he or she has provided confidential information to the legal practitioner; and demonstrate that there at least a theoretical possibility that the confidential information could be used to the advantage of the other party, or, alternatively, to the disadvantage of the complainant. in order to meet the two requirements in (a) above, the complainant need do no more than depose to the fact that he or she</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.7" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">has conveyed confidential information to the legal practitioner; and believes, not unreasonably, that the confidential information may be used against him or her, or to his or her disadvantage, in the current proceedings. delay irrespective of the ground relied upon to restrain a legal practitioner from acting for a party to litigation, delay, and especially unreasonable or unexplained delay, is likely to be fatal to the application. the leading authority is mcgillivray v mitchell , [31] where the full court said: [32] ... if a family law litigant has a genuine concern about a former legal adviser acting against him or her in later family law litigation, the litigant must take the point at least in correspondence with the other side at the earliest possible opportunity. if he or she does not do so, then he or she is possessed of a weapon which can later be used as a delaying tactic at some point in the proceedings convenient to his or her position. furthermore a failure to take the point initially must also cast doubt on the bona fides of any later complaint concerning the existence of confidential information in the practitioner in question, and on the bona fides of any alleged apprehension regarding the possible misuse of such confidential information. the wife's submissions  the wife's submissions were filed on 22 november 2010. i shall refer to them as "ws". they contain the following concessions: in family law, in australia, even if there is only a "theoretical risk" of prejudice to a party (arising from an alleged conflict of interest), then the solicitor for the other party should not continue to act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.8" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">and a court has the power to restrain a legal practitioner in such circumstances. although a party ordinarily has a right to engage his/her solicitor of choice, each case (dealing with an alleged conflict of interest) must be determined on its merits, with the court having a discretion as to whether or not a legal practitioner should be restrained from acting. the husband made his objection known to mr koutsoupias at an early date. it is neither necessary nor desirable for the court to go behind the husband's version of events regarding his dealings with mr koutsoupias. one consultation between the husband and mr koutsoupias could theoretically provide the basis for a conflict of interest to arise. in other words, it is not essential for a solicitor/client relationship to continue over an extended period. all the above concessions are important. they are consistent with the authorities referred to elsewhere in these reasons. ws refer to various matters deposed to by the husband in his affidavit material. the primary submissions contained in ws, however, are to the following effect: because the wife was present at all times during the husband's consultation with mr koutsoupias, the husband could not have conveyed "confidential information" to mr koutsoupias. in any event, the husband did not provide (and does not assert that he provided) mr koutsoupias with any "confidential information" which could be used to his disadvantage. further, and because of the presence of the wife during the consultation, any information conveyed to mr koutsoupias at that time (whether confidential or not) could not be used</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.9" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">in any relevant sense</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.10" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">to the advantage of the wife; nor could it be used to the disadvantage of the husband. the husband's submissions  the husband's submissions were filed on 6 december 2010. i shall refer to them as "hs". hs refer to various matters deposed to by the husband and mr koutsoupias in the affidavit material. the primary submissions contained in hs are to the following effect: justice will not be seen to have been done if mr koutsoupias is permitted to continue to act for the wife. mr koutsoupias has been provided with confidential information. there is a possibility that mr koutsoupias will be required to give evidence in the proceedings, because he may seek to contradict the husband's version of statements or admissions made at the conference on 22 september 2009. during the course of the conference, mr koutsoupias observed that tensions arose around issues relating to the ownership of property p. as a result, mr koutsoupias had the advantage of observing the husband in such a situation. in the present case, the "getting to know you" factors place the husband at a distinct disadvantage. given the "particular sensitivities" associated with family law proceedings, the theoretical risks if mr koutsoupias were to continue to represent the wife to the husband are manifest. discussion  in paragraph 21 of hs, mr mort (counsel for the husband) submitted as follows: on any objective basis, a reasonable person would see that in a situation where a lawyer has conferred at length with the husband, where a lawyer has allegedly made a judgement call on the husband's conduct in terms of third parties registered on title, where the lawyer has observed the husband in a tense situation and calls an end to the conference, where the lawyer is now privy to confidential information provided by the husband on an important trial issue, and where the husband will know for the duration of the matter that his wife's lawyer has a perceived advantage due to his contact with him, then (there is a serious risk of an injustice to the husband). i agree with mr mort. the reality is that mr koutsoupias has already joined issue with the husband on a number of factual issues surrounding statements or admissions made or allegedly made during the course of the conference on 21 september 2009. the very fact that mr koutsoupias has sworn an affidavit disputing the husband's version of events makes it clear that he has seen fit to "enter the arena" (as it were) as a witness in support of the wife. and there is a strong likelihood that he will be required to give evidence on behalf of the wife. such a likelihood does not sit comfortably with accepted concepts of the due administration of justice, including the appearance of justice. i reject the suggestion that the husband could not have conveyed confidential information to mr koutsoupias because the wife was present at all relevant times. as o'ryan j observed in pond &amp; thurga (no 2) , the adoption of the current approach to this subject in the family law jurisdiction had its genesis in cases concerning practitioners who had acted for both husband and wife. the expression "confidential information" does not refer to information about which the other party to the litigation is unaware. it is intended to encompass information conveyed (directly or indirectly) to a legal practitioner in the context of a client providing instructions to the practitioner, or otherwise seeking the practitioner's advice. it matters not, it seems to me, that another person may be present when the information is conveyed. after all, the wife may not have understood the significance of information imparted by the husband</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.11" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">but mr koutsoupias, in his role as her solicitor, would have a clear obligation to explain its significance to her. he would also have a clear obligation to use the information for her benefit in the litigation. and there are other possibilities. for example, the wife might forget something that the husband said or admitted during the joint conference, but mr koutsoupias would be obliged to remind her of the statement or admission. a further example could arise in the event of the wife and mr koutsoupias having different recollections of statements or admissions made by the husband during the conference. mr koutsoupias might then find that his own recollection is arguably more advantageous (or disadvantageous) to the wife's case than her own. mr mort submits that paragraph 23 of mr koutsoupias' affidavit is "iniquitous", and that it</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.12" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">demonstrates a lack of fairness and calls on the husband to gaze into a crystal ball. ... (there) was never any hint at the time of the conference in question that mr koutsoupias might represent the wife one day soon; there was never a clue that any comments or reactions made by the husband ... might one day fortify the wife's appointed representative and, ultimately, the wife's case. paragraph 23 of mr koutsoupias' affidavit is as follows: ... it appeared to me and continues to appear to me that (the husband's) consent and full disclosures in front of (the wife) go to show that discussions had not reached a point at which a perception of conflict could reasonably be held. to the extent that it is possible to understand the point that mr koutsoupias is endeavouring to make in this paragraph (and assuming that the matters deposed to in the paragraph are somehow relevant and admissible), i agree with mr mort. conclusion  it was conceded in ws that the husband made his objection known to mr koutsoupias at an early date (and that, as a result, no issue of delay arises), and that it is neither necessary nor desirable for the court to go behind the husband's version of events regarding his dealings with mr koutsoupias. it was also conceded that a single consultation between the husband and mr koutsoupias could theoretically provide the basis for a conflict of interest to arise. in my opinion, a fair minded, reasonably informed member of the public would have no hesitation in concluding that the proper administration of justice requires that mr koutsoupias should be prevented from acting for the wife. the interests of the protection of the integrity of the judicial process and the due administration of justice (including the appearance of justice) dictate such a conclusion</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.13" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">which, in all the circumstances of the present case, is inevitable. it is inevitable that mr koutsoupias should be prevented from acting for the wife even when regard is had to: the fact that the court's power to restrain a legal practitioner from acting for a party to litigation is exceptional; and the weight to be given to the public interest in a litigant not being deprived of his or her lawyer of choice without a good reason. i find that there is a real risk of lack of objectivity if mr koutsoupias were to continue to act for the wife. put another way, i find that there exists a fair and reasonable perception that mr koutsoupias may not now be able to exercise the independent judgement that is required of him as legal representative for the wife and as an officer of the court. indeed, that lack of objectivity and impaired independent judgement has already manifested itself in the evidence contained in mr koutsoupias' affidavit. i find that there is a strong possibility that mr koutsoupias will become a witness in the proceedings, and that the proceedings are likely to involve an evaluation of his conduct during the conference on 21 september 2009. further, mr koutsoupias has already felt impelled to justify or defend his conduct in representing the wife. as well, there is no doubt that his credibility could be at stake. the "getting to know you" factors would not be sufficient in themselves to justify a decision to restrain mr koutsoupias from acting for the wife, but those factors serve to reinforce the conclusions that i have reached in these reasons. although mr koutsoupias' relationship with the husband and the wife was not built up over an extended period of time, he saw them both</citphrase>

<citphrase id="cp20.15" type=citing from="[2011] FMCAfam 6">at a time of obvious tension for each of them. it is understandable that the husband would feel anxiety about mr koutsoupias' role as the wife's legal representative, and that he would perceive him as being in a position of unfair superiority. i find that the husband has indeed raised a prima facie case that he provided confidential information to mr koutsoupias, and that mr koutsoupias purported to provide him with legal advice based on that information. [33] i find, as well, that the confidential information could be used to the advantage of the wife (and the disadvantage of the husband). indeed, the matters deposed to in mr koutsoupias' affidavit reveal that the information has already been used in this way. in all the circumstances, i conclude that mr koutsoupias should no longer act for the wife in these proceedings. orders  i shall hear counsel as to the orders (if any) that may be necessary to give effect to the conclusion that i have reached in the preceding paragraph.  i certify that the preceding sixty-eight (68) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of walters fm</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NNTTA 66">There is a suggestion that matters related to Njamal People should be directed to Rainer Mathews in the South Hedland office and any overarching land access agreement issues should be directed to Sukhpal Singh. [56] The native title party filed lengthy submissions in relation to the circumstances in which a lawyer should be restrained from acting against a former client. The native title party contended that there were essentially three circumstances in which a court would restrain a lawyer from acting against a former client (NTP contentions 54-84): where there is a danger of misuse of confidential information (see Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG (a firm) [1998] UKHL 52 ; [1999] 2 AC 222 ; [2000] ANZ ConvR 260 ; [1999] 1 All ER 517 ; [1999] 2 WLR 215 (' Bolkiah '), Mallesons Stephen Jaques v KPMG Peat Marwick and Others (1990) 4 WAR 357 ; [1991] ANZ ConvR 200 (' Mallesons '), The Law Society of Western Australia Professional Conduct Rules (July 2008 revision rule 6.3, 6.5, 7.6 (rules)); where there has been a breach of duty of loyalty not to act against a former client in the same matter or a closely related matter (see for instance Spincode Pty Ltd v Look Software Pty Ltd (2001) 4 VR 501; [2001] VSCA 248 (' Spincode '), but also note Ismail-Zai v the State of Western Australia [2007] WASCA 150 (' Ismail-Zai ') per Steytler JA at [23]-[25]); and where the court has inherent jurisdiction on the grounds of fairness and justice (which would be better put as the court acting under its inherent supervisory jurisdiction) considers that it is necessary to do so in order to ensure the due administration of justice ( Ismail-Zai at 19), see ( Geelong School Supplies Pty Ltd v Dean (2006) 237 ALR 612 ; [2006] FCA 1404) (' Geelong School Supplies '), Spincode , Ismail-Zai, Kallinicos v Hunt (2005) 64 NSWLR 561 ; [2005] NSWSC 1181 (' Kallinicos '), State of Western Australia v Ward on behalf of Miriuwung Gajerrong Peoples (1997) 76 FCR 492 ; (1997) 145 ALR 512 ; [1997] FCA 585 ; [1997] WAG 57/97 (' Ward ')). 
 [57] The native title party submits that in Bolkiah the court, per Lord Millet, came to the conclusion that the 'only basis for restraining a lawyer for acting against a former client is the danger of misuse of confidential information'. In that matter the court of appeal overturned the decision in Rakusen v Ellis, Munday &amp; Clarke [1912] 1 Ch 831where it had previously been held by the Court that there was no absolute rule in England that a solicitor may not act against a former client in litigation, but that a solicitor would be restrained if such restriction was necessary to avoid a significant risk of disclosure or misuse of confidential information belonging to a former client.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] QCA 2">The evidence does not justify such a finding.

In his decision, however, Justice O'Ryan at paragraph 209 to 218 onwards considered the grounds upon which legal practitioners may be restrained from acting for a party and referred to most recent decisions including that of Justice Young in Geelong School Supplies Pty.

[3] In Canberra Residential Developments the Federal Court, having referred to the above grounds, went on to observe as follows: 20.

 Although the Supreme Court of New South Wales has declined to follow Spincode , insofar as Brooking JA held that the equitable obligation of loyalty owed by a solicitor to his or her client survives the termination of the retainer, the decisions in New South Wales do not cast any doubt upon the court's inherent power to restrain solicitors from acting in a particular case having regard to the interests of the administration of justice. Similarly, the court's inherent supervisory jurisdiction over solicitors and counsel was not relevant to the House of Lords decision in Bolkiah.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 74">The applicants have not pointed to any privileged document which has actually been read by any of the second to sixth respondents. It follows that the Court is unable to identify any detriment which has been occasioned to the applicants in the conduct of their defence to the Portsea litigation. In my view, a similar approach should be taken to an application to prevent a trustee in bankruptcy, or a trustee's staff, from continuing to prosecute a particular legal action as courts have traditionally taken in deciding whether to restrain a legal practitioner from acting in litigation where that legal practitioner has obtained an advantage which could operate unfairly on another party to the litigation. The relevant authorities include GT Corporation Pty Ltd v Amare Safety Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 123 , H. Starke &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Von Stanke, O'Meara [2006] SASC 308 ; (2006) 95 SASR 425 , Xat Ky v Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1541 and Geelong School Supplies Ltd v Dean [2006] FCA 1404 ; (2006) 237 ALR 612. Those authorities indicate that the discretion to grant an injunction is to be exercised sparingly and where, as it would be perceived by a fair-minded reasonable observer, the risk to the proper administration of justice would outweigh the denial to the opposing litigant of his or her choice of legal representative and the cost and inconvenience of being compelled to change counsel or solicitors. See also Bureau Interprofessional Des Vins De Bourgogne v Red Earth Nominees Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 588 , where I reviewed some of the cognate authorities on an application to restrain a firm of solicitors from continuing to act in proceedings because a solicitor employed by that firm had obtained information confidential to another party in the litigation as a result of having, whilst a partner in another firm, advised that party. I there assessed, at [60], whether there was a real risk of relevant confidential information coming into the hands of the firm by which the solicitor was then employed. In the light of that assessment, the injunction was refused. </sentence>

 Justice Young in Geelong School [2006] FCA 1404 recently set out the relevant legal principles to be applied when considering whether to restrain a legal practitioner from acting for a particular party to litigation, there being three possible grounds for so restraining a legal practitioner.

On behalf of AMP it was said that the decision of Young J in Geelong School Supplies Pty Ltd v Dean [5] was authority for the conclusion that, even in such a case, a reasonably informed and fair-minded observer would conclude that the lawyers for EPAS should be prevented from continuing to act for it in S3544 of 2000 so that justice should not only be done but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.</sentence>

 209. There are three grounds which have emerged in the case law as a basis for restraining legal practitioners from acting for a party to litigation. These grounds were identified in Spincode Pty Ltd v Look Software Pty Ltd [2001] VSCA 248 ; (2001) 4 VR 501 by Brooking JA, a succinct summary of which is provided by Young J in the recent decision of Geelong School Supplies Pty Ltd v Dean [2006] FCA 1404: 
 
 [24] In Spincode Pty Ltd v Look Software Pty Ltd [2001] VSCA 248 ; (2001) 4 VR 501 (' Spincode' ) at 521---524 [52]---[58], Brooking JA identified three possible grounds for restraining a solicitor or counsel from acting for a particular party to litigation: the danger of misuse of confidential information; a breach of a fiduciary duty of loyalty not to act against a client, or against a former client in the same matter or a closely related matter; and the inherent jurisdiction of the court to control the conduct of solicitors and counsel as officers of the court. These three grounds represented the orthodox legal position in Australia prior to the decision of the House of Lords in Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG ( a firm ) [1998] UKHL 52 ; [1999] 2 AC 222 ('Bolkiah' ) which held that the duty of loyalty did not survive the termination of the relationship with the client. Brooking JA's analysis in Spincode has been consistently followed and applied in Victoria: see Sent v John Fairfax Publication Pty Ltd [2002] VSC 429 ; Pinnacle Living Pty Ltd v Elusive Image Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 202 ; and Adam 12 Holdings Pty Ltd v Eat &amp; Drink Holdings Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 152. But it has not been followed in New South Wales. 
 
 As Young J pointed out at [25] the position in New South Wales after the House of Lords decision in Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG [1998] UKHL 52 ; [1999] 2 AC 222 has consistently been that the jurisdiction of the court to intervene at the suit of a former client to restrain a solicitor from acting is founded solely on the real risk of disclosure of confidential information and not some principle of conflict of interest: see Belan v Casey [2002] NSWSC 58 per Young CJ in Eq; British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Blanch [2004] NSWSC 70 per Young CJ in Eq at [97]---[104] and Asia Pacific Telecommunications Ltd v Optus Networks Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 550 per Bergin J at [51]---[55].
