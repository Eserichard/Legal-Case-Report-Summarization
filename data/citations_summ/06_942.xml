<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 318">As I now understand it, the parties have agreed the question of law and that is whether or not it was open to the Tribunal to adopt a constrained interpretation of the word "representative" given the context of its use in the Ministerial Determination. 10 To put the applicant's submission shortly, it is that, having regard to the context and purpose of the Determination, the word "representative" comprehends a person who provides the relevant service under the aegis of, as an emissary of, or in association with, one of the defined philanthropic organisations. Iversen v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 942 ; (2006) 91 ALD 114 , it is said, is distinguishable on its facts. 11 The respondent's case is that the view taken by the Tribunal, that "representative" connotes an entitlement to act on behalf of another, was one that was open to it. It could not be an error of law for it to have taken that view. As we have previously advised you if Mr Wooding or Mr Milburn-Lloyd are able to provide evidence that they completed the AFOF accreditation process, such as being allocated a service number or service record, or were issued with an approved identification card, then they may have a case for being considered an accredited member of a philanthropic organisation. "
 
 THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 
 
8 It is sufficient for present purposes if I set out in full the following paragraphs of the Tribunal's reasons:
 
 
 "8. I was referred to a decision of Edmonds J in Iversen v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 942. This decision answered an appeal from a decision of Senior Member Kelly in Re Iversen &amp; Repatriation Commission [2006] AATA 280. In her decision Senior Member Kelly rejected an argument to the effect that Mr Iversen (who also provided entertainment for troops serving in Vietnam under similar circumstances to Mr Wooding) should be treated as a full-time member of the Defence Force serving in an operational area.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] AATA 907">" 
 
 

This Determination defines "an approved philanthropic organisation" as including the AFOF.
