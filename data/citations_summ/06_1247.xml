Section 359B(4) of the Act is cast in the present tense ("If a person is to respond" and "the response is to be made"). This, as the Full Court noted in Sun (146 FCR at 509-510) suggests that any application for an enlargement of time must be made while the time stipulated in the original letter of request is still running. The Full Court did not find it necessary to determine the question (see at 510) but, in Usman v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 966 at [44], Pascoe CFM held that the power granted by s 359B(4) of the Act could only be exercised within the period allowed when the original request was made. Had it been necessary to do so I would have held that the Tribunal could not have enlarged time pursuant to s 359B(4) of the Act after, at the latest, 6 April 2005. </sentence>

In my view no 'breach' of s 424B(2) occurred and, in any event, any failure to comply with its strict terms did not, in the circumstances of this case at least, amount to jurisdictional error on the part of the RRT. The Minister's latest written submissions drew attention to judgments of this Court to similar effect ( SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 449 and M v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1247 ; (2006) 155 FCR 333 at [34] - [37] ). " It is noteworthy that his Honour specifically excluded the reasoning in SZKTI, SZKCQ and SZIZO . His Honour gave the principal judgment in SZKCQ where he again discussed the imperative nature of s.424A in contrast with that of s.424 saying at [53] and [54]: "[53] As I earlier indicated, the requirements about the method by which an invitation must be given in s 424(3) are stated in identical terms to the requirements to be found in s 424A(2) about the way in which the RRT must invite an applicant to comment on information which 'would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming a decision that is under review'. [49] I do not see how, having regard to the language of s 424B(2) or the scope of Div 4, a breach which consisted of giving an applicant more time than he or she was entitled to, could be thought to render invalid a decision given after the breach. This must be especially so where the information was provided and a hearing took place in accordance with s 425. " 
 The matter was then considered by Tracey J in respect of the mirror provision in relation to the Migration Review Tribunal s.359B in M v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1247. In this case, as with others, it was argued that the failure to comply with the provisions of 359B(2) meant that there was no lawful invitation to provide additional information and therefore the applicant was not a person to whom (in this case s.359C(2)), in refugee cases s.424C(1) applied and the applicant remained entitled to the oral hearing mandated by the Act.

<sentence id="cs86" from="[2009] FMCA 281">The effect of s.363A appears to be to remove any discretion. The issue was considered by his Honour Tracey J in M v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1247 ; (2006) 91 ALD 629. At [39] - [46] his Honour said: Section 360 of the Act ensures that, subject to certain limited exceptions, all applicants are invited to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and make submissions in support of their applications. One of the exceptions, provided for in s 360(2)(c) of the Act arises where s 359C(1) of the Act applies to an applicant. Section 359C(1) of the Act so applies where an invitation to provide additional information has been extended under s 359 and that information has not been provided within the time stipulated in the letter of invitation. That is of no consequence, however, if the Tribunal (contrary to its assumption) had no discretion. The effect of s.363A appears to be to remove any discretion. The issue was considered by his Honour Tracey J in M v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1247 ; (2006) 91 ALD 629.

One of the exceptions, provided for in s 360(2)(c) of the Act arises where s 359C(1) of the Act applies to an applicant. Section 363A provides, in that situation, that the Tribunal 'does not have power to permit the person to do that thing'. There is a lack of unanimity in the authorities as to whether s 363A deprives the Tribunal of any discretion to invite the review applicant to attend a hearing, once s 360(2) and (3) come into operation. [26] If necessary the Minister would submit that s 363A does have that effect. However, the issue does not need to be resolved: the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that it did have a discretion but was not prepared to exercise it. [27] The issue that arises (and is pursued in the Applicant's written submissions) is whether the reasoning of the High Court in SZBEL somehow trumps the effect of ss 360(2) and (3). These proceedings began with a show cause application filed on 
4 November 2008. The applicant later filed an amended application after having obtained legal representation. I conducted a show cause hearing on that amended application on 6 March 2009. At that hearing I ordered the Minister to show cause why relief should not be granted in relation to the issue of whether the applicant's failure to respond to a letter dated 4 August 2008 [22] deprived the applicant of a hearing pursuant to s.360 of the Migration Act , having regard to s.363A of the Migration and the decisions of Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Sun [2008] FCAFC 201 and M v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1247 ; (2006) 91 ALD 629 and the decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152. </sentence>

 23. The Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by holding that hearing, but, in doing so, it did not deny the applicant procedural fairness. Indeed, this is a case where, irrespective of any question of procedural fairness or individual merits, the decision-maker was bound to affirm the delegate's decision. As a consequence, the applicant suffered no injustice by reason of the Tribunal's action in excess of jurisdiction when it gave him an opportunity to give evidence and put arguments as to why the decision of the delegate should not be affirmed. Consequently, notwithstanding that jurisdictional error has been demonstrated by reason that the Tribunal held a hearing when it had no power to do so, relief will nevertheless be refused in the exercise of the Court's discretion: Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 ; SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2005) 215 ALR 162 ; M v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1247 ; (2006) 155 FCR 333. 
  
 22. The Minister's submissions raised the issue of whether a jurisdictional error might be identified in the fact that the Tribunal had held a hearing at all. This arose in circumstances where the Tribunal was not obliged under s.360 to invite the applicant to a hearing because he had failed to respond to the s.359A notice. The interaction of ss.362 and 363 and 359C (2) have this effect. Significantly, s.363A provides: 
 
 
 If a provision of this Part states that a person is not entitled to do something, or to be assisted or represented by another person, then, unless a provision expressly provides otherwise, the Tribunal does not have power to permit the person to do that thing, or to be assisted or represented by another person. 
 
 
 Consequently, the Tribunal had no power to hold the hearing to which it invited the applicant: M v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1247 ; (2006) 155 FCR 333 at 345-346 [46] . </sentence>

 16. The Tribunal stated as well in its letter dated 13 October 2006 (CB 132): 
 
 
 If the Tribunal does not receive any comments within the period allowed or as extended, it may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to obtain your comments or to invite you to appear before the Tribunal. 
 
 
 The Tribunal therefore complied with s.359C(1) of the Act , which provides that if a person does not give the information before the time for giving it has passed the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to obtain the additional information. The Tribunal did however consider information received on 5 December 2006 (CB 144-145). The Tribunal complied with the Act and was entitled to make a decision on the review without conducting a hearing. As s.359C(1) and (2) apply to the applicant, the applicant was not entitled to appear before the Tribunal: s.360(2)(c) and s. 360 (3). The Court refers to the decision of Tracey J in M v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1247 ; (2006) 91 ALD 629 at [46] as follows:
