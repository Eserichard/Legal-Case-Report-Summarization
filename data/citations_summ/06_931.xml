<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1293">First, the nature and complexity of the issues raised by that pleading is such that they can only be resolved properly in a full trial, with full discovery, cross-examination of witnesses etc, and not in any summary way on a separate question. As part of that examination, the Court will be required to consider complex factual questions including: 
(1) The circumstances surrounding the issuing of the instruction by the President of the Russian Federation 'to take urgent measures to reinstate and protect the State's rights over intellectual property in the area of production and circulation of vodka products, and to identify and bring legal action against the persons involved in infringement of those rights' (see S.P.I. Spirits (Cyprus) Ltd v Diageo Australia Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 931 ; (2006) 155 FCR 150 at [8] );
 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the Russian Federation, through what Spirits alleges is its appointed representative, FKP, taking procedural steps in several countries, including Australia, with the aim of wresting ownership of foreign registrations for trade marks from their present owners (see S.P.I. Spirits (Cyprus) Ltd v Diageo Australia Ltd (No 2) at [9]);
 
(3) the political circumstances connecting the issuing of the instruction in (1), the taking of the steps in (2), and the political circumstances in which Spirits' predecessor in title, VAO-SPI, was transformed (on Spirits' case) or purportedly transformed (on FKP's case, see FACC paras 13 and 14) from a State-owned corporation (Sojuzplodoimport) into a private corporation around the time of dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991; and
 
(4) what Spirits will allege is the acquiescence by the Russian courts in implementing the plans of the executive in relation to the above, which acquiescence finds expression in, inter alia , the 2001 Judgment. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] VSC 417">[86] See, eg, Absolute Analogue Inc v Sundance Resources Ltd [2008] WASC 259 (Le Miere J) at [31]-[32]; Sogelease Australia Ltd v Griffin [2003] NSWSC 178 (Palmer J) at [37]; Bova v Avati [2009] NSWSC 921 (Ward J) at [363]-[364], [370]-[373]. [87] That was the situation in Sabre itself. See also Bova v Avati [2009] NSWSC 921 at [370] - [374]; cf SPI Spirits (Cyprus) Ltd v Diageo Australia Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 931 ; (2006) 155 FCR 150. [88] [1998] VSC 46. [89] At [18]-[19].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWSC 921">370 As to whether a Sabre order would have been appropriate, I note that in SPI Spirits (Cyprus) Limited v Diageo Australia Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 931 ; (2006) 155 FCR 150 , Edmonds J, who had made an order for third-party discovery against foreign entities (which decision was overturned on appeal) and so did not strictly need to consider the possibility of a Sabre order, said the following:
 

 
 
 First, there must be a real likelihood that the party ... who is to take steps to obtain access to and discover the documents which are in the possession, power or control of a third party, would be given access to the documents upon request: See Sabre at 432---433. This likelihood must be established by evidence: Gambro at [8], [17]---[19] ... 
 
 Second, there must be a likelihood that the documents sought are in fact in existence in the possession of the third party ... 
 
 Third, the form of order in para 5 is otherwise inappropriate. In particular, the word 'reasonable' in the phrase 'take all reasonable steps' has been omitted from the usual form of order. ... I agree ... that it would be preferable for any such order to set out explicitly the steps which, if taken, would satisfy the order. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] WASC 259">31 Section 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) confers power upon the Federal Court to direct a party to take steps to obtain access to and discover documents which are in the possession, power or control of a third party where there is a real likelihood that a party to the proceeding would be given access to the documents upon request: Sabre Corp Pty Ltd v Russ Kalvin's Hair Care Co [1993] FCA 557 ; (1993) 124 ALR 400 , 404. The conditions for making a 'Sabre' order were stated by Edmonds J in SPI Spirits (Cyprus) Ltd v Diageo Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 931 [31] - [32]:
 
 First, there must be a real likelihood that the party, in this case FKP and FGUP, who is to take steps to obtain access to and discover the documents which are in the possession, power or control of a third party, would be given access to the documents upon request: see Sabre at 432 - 433. This likelihood must be established by evidence: Gambro Pty Ltd v Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 581 , [8], [17] - [19] ... Second, there must be a likelihood that the documents sought are in fact in existence in the possession of the third party. </sentence>
