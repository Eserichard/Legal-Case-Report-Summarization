<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 91">In support of the Applicant's case, the Secretary has referred to observations made in several income tax cases concerning the inferences to be drawn from evidence as a result of asset betterment investigations: see L'Estrange v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1978) 78 ATC 4744 at 4764-6; Szajntop v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 93 ATC 4307 at 4313; Vu v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889 at [26] . However, those taxation cases are distinguishable on their facts and relevant circumstances and are of little assistance in this case. Also, they are made in the context of income tax legislation which impose onus of proof provisions not applicable under the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 289">The respondent is also not required to establish a positive case as to the source of the funds in question ( Vu v Commissioner of Taxation 2006 ATC 4387 ; [2006] FCA 889 ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 345">51 Like in the case before me, the applicable legislation in Deledio was not silent on issues of proof. In relation to the first issue in this case with respect to onus of proof, it is clear in light of s 14ZZK(b)(i) TA Act that the taxpayer in this case bore the onus of proof that the amended assessment was excessive. The nature of the onus of proof in the context of this legislation has been recognised in numerous decisions, including McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284 (although McCormack was decided under predecessor legislation), Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro (1997) 97 ATC 5041 and Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889. Further, it is clear on the authorities that the taxpayer, in its application before the Tribunal, must prove its case affirmatively on the balance of probabilities: McCormack 143 CLR at 303 per Gibbs J, Munro 97 ATC 5041 , Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889 at [8] . 51 Like in the case before me, the applicable legislation in Deledio was not silent on issues of proof.
