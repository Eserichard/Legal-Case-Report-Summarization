<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 860">The matter was listed this morning before Foster J. It appears that argument in relation to the making of a further interim order came to an end, when his Honour's attention was drawn to the judgment of Tamberlin J in Asaad v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1039 which discusses the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and this Court in relation to administrative actions taken under s.198(6) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). His Honour then ordered the transfer of the matter to this Court, and it came before me at 2.15pm. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 763">But doubt as to whether this Court's jurisdiction has been properly invoked need not presently be resolved because the power to transfer a proceeding exists even where a question arises as to jurisdiction: cf Assad v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1039. Tamberlin J there concluded: 
 [21] I note that during argument as to whether the Court ought to transfer the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court, a question arose as to whether this Court has power to remit a "proceeding" to the Federal Magistrates Court where this Court does not have jurisdiction due to the absence of a federal "matter". In my view, the expression "proceeding" in s 32AB of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is distinct from the expression "matter" (as used in s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth)) and is sufficiently wide to encompass the present dispute between the parties. I therefore consider that the Court has power to, and should, transfer the proceeding notwithstanding any doubt which may exist as to its jurisdiction to hear and determine the application. 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1524">On 14 July 2008, he ordered that the proceeding be transferred to this Court (see [The Applicant] v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1039). He said that there was a doubt about the Federal Court's jurisdiction in the matter, and that this Court's jurisdiction was clearer. His Honour appears to have proceeded on the basis that a "migration decision", as defined in the Migration Act as a precondition to this Court's jurisdiction under s.476 , had been identified by the applicant, being a particular past or proposed decision by the Minister to effect the applicant's removal from Australia. He said that the considerations, on balance, favoured transferring the proceeding to this Court "thereby avoiding unnecessary delay and expense resulting from disputes concerning jurisdiction. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1263">7 Division 2 of Part 8 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides for the manner in which decisions may be reviewed by the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court and the High Court. Section 476 provides for the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. Section 476(2)(a) and (d), it has recently been held, are not invalid because they oblige the High Court to exercise exclusively and without remitter the jurisdiction conferred by s 75(v) of the Constitution with respect to certain decisions of the Minister: MZXOT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] HCA 28. Section 476A provides for the limited original jurisdiction to be entertained by this Court: eg, Assad v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1039 ; La Bara v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 785 at [3] ; Shuster v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 215 at [6]---[7] [2008] FCA 215 ; , 167 FCR 186 at 188. The appellate jurisdiction of this Court is relevantly that conferred by s 24(1)(d) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). That appellate jurisdiction may be exercised by a single Judge of this Court: s 25(1AA)(a). </sentence>
