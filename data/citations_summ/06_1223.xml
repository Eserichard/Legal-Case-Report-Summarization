<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] NSWSC 1049">21 The deed draws a distinction between "the Funds" (as defined) and "the Company's property" (undefined). I doubt that this is intended to indicate that "the Funds" are not property of the company (cf Federal Commissioner of Taxation v All Suburbs Car Repairs Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1393 ; (1994) 14 ACSR 753 ; Lombe v Wagga Leagues Club Ltd [2006] NSWSC 3 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 387 ; Re Purchas; Estore Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1222 ; (2006) 154 FCR 246 ; Purchas; Worldwide Workers Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1223). The indication is, rather, that such property of the company as is not within either of the two designated funds is to be dealt with, together with the property within the funds, in the ways specified in relation to "the Company's property and the Funds" --- while property within a particular fund (but not other property) is to be dealt with in the ways specified in relation to that fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1329">The material facts in Purchas, in the matter of Estore Pty Limited (in liq) [2006] FCA 1222 and Purchas, in the matter of Worldwide Workers Pty Limited (in liq) [2006] FCA 1223 are indistinguishable in substance from this case. Directions will be given and an order for costs will be made for the same reasons as those appearing in the aforementioned cases.
