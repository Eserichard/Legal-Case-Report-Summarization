 "A preliminary observation, however, is that it would not have been intended that any omission from the copy of a warrant made available under s 3H(1) to the occupier of premises being searched would invalidate the execution of the search warrant. A photocopying error may have led to an insignificant corner of a page, or the numbering of a page, being left out. The process of photocopying may have blurred a small section of the text, but a section which did not in the circumstances have any particular significance. There may be other illustrations. "
