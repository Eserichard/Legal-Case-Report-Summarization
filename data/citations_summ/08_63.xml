<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1364">351 Finally, while I do not fault Mr Frick's motives in seeking to verify that the packout figures provided to him were achievable and to validate the yield information before him, and while I understand his reasons for not wishing to disclose his industry sources, this is not a situation where, for example, he has himself produced a report on the basis of undisclosed data which has been published in a reputable journal and subject to peer review and independent criticism (cf discussion in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 63 at [776] - [779]). Mr Frick's expertise may have qualified him to know which (unidentified) growers and industry consultants to contact, and to ask for relevant information upon which he could base his opinion, however it is not reasonable that the applicants in the context of these proceedings should be expected to accept such a process without question, where sources were not identified. 350 Seventh, as I observed earlier in this judgment this is not a situation where the expert has sought to rely upon reputable articles, publications and material produced by others in the area in which they have expertise, and which is hearsay, as a basis for the expert opinion (cf for example Bodney [2008] FCAFC 63 at [92] , Alphapharm [2008] FCA 63 at [762] ).</sentence>
