<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 382">It is then necessary to refer to some decisions which are contrary to the conclusion in Allergy Pathway . Three cases suggest that the presence of an agreed statement of facts under s 191 releases the operation of the "principle" that declarations may not be made on agreed facts. The first of these preceded in time Allergy Pathway: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 710. There Besanko J merely said (at [13]): 
 
 In the ordinary case, a Court will not make a declaration by consent unless it is satisfied by evidence that it should do so. In this case, I have the statement of agreed facts under s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and, by reason of that section, evidence is not required to prove the existence of the agreed facts.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 375">As a general principle, a Court does not make declarations on matters relating to public rights by consent or on admissions, unless it is satisfied by evidence: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 at [18] --- [19]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 710 at [13] ; Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Rich (No 2) [2004] NSWSC 836 ; (2004) 50 ACSR 500 at [10] ; Williams v Powell [1894] WN (Eng) 141; Gramophone Co Ltd v Magazine Holder Co (1911) 28 RPC 221 at 225-227; Termijtelen v Van Arkel [1974] 1 NSWLR 525 ; Wallersteiner v Moir [1974] 3 All ER 217 ; Metzger v Department of Health and Social Security [1977] 3 All ER 444 at 451; BMI Ltd v Federated Clerks Union of Australia (NSW) Branch (1983) 51 ALR 401 ; Young P W, Declaratory Orders (2nd ed, 1984) [601]. In the present case, that is not an issue. Fantastic Furniture has signed the Agreed Statement: see [3] and [4] above. That statement, to which s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) applies, is evidence. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 372">As a general principle, a Court does not make declarations on matters relating to public rights by consent or on admissions, unless it is satisfied by evidence: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 at [18] --- [19]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 710 at [13] ; Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Rich (No 2) [2004] NSWSC 836 ; (2004) 50 ACSR 500 at [10] ; Williams v Powell [1894] WN (Eng) 141; Gramophone Co Ltd v Magazine Holder Co (1911) 28 RPC 221 at 225-227; Termijtelen v Van Arkel [1974] 1 NSWLR 525 ; Wallersteiner v Moir [1974] 3 All ER 217 ; Metzger v Department of Health and Social Security [1977] 3 All ER 444 at 451; BMI Ltd v Federated Clerks Union of Australia (NSW) Branch (1983) 51 ALR 401 ; Young P W, Declaratory Orders (2nd ed, 1984) [601]. In the present case, that is not an issue. As noted earlier, Dimmeys signed the Agreed Statement: see [4] above. That statement, to which s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) applies, is evidence. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 584">I need to make some comments about the evidence. Initially the parties tendered only the agreed statements of facts and admissions to justify the making of the orders. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 , I decided that, generally speaking, it was necessary before a declaration of contravention could be made that evidence had to be tendered that justified the relief. In reaching that decision I had not been referred to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 710 , which is to a different effect. There, Besanko J said that that s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) altered the common law in that evidence was no longer required to obtain a declaration affecting public rights. For reasons which I will now explain, I would not follow ACCC v Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd for it is, I think, plainly incorrect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCAFC 65">For example, it has been adopted in relation to the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) in the context of accessorial liability: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution (No. 2) [2002] FCA 559 ; (2002) 190 ALR 169 at [16] and [18]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCA 11 at [66] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v TEAC Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1859 at [27] and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 710 at [70] and [86]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 58">Section 191 was relied on by Besanko J when his Honour made declarations in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 710. His Honour had before him a statement of agreed facts that was in the form required by s 191 and admitted into evidence pursuant to that section. His Honour was requested to make declarations on the basis of facts in the statement of agreed facts. His Honour said at [13]: 
 
 As far as the five declarations are concerned, the Court's power to make binding declarations of right is contained in s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In the ordinary case, a Court will not make a declaration by consent unless it is satisfied by evidence that it should do so. In this case, I have the statement of agreed facts under s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and, by reason of that section, evidence is not required to prove the existence of the agreed facts.
