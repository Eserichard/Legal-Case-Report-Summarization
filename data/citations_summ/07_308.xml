<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 928">A bankruptcy notice may be addressed to joint debtors who are each obliged to pay the full debt and are therefore able to comply with the notice: Hubner v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group [1999] FCA 385 ; (1999) 88 FCR 445 at [19] to [22]; Biggs v CNH Capital Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FMCA 147 at [15] to [19]; Dimasi and Another v Nangiloc Colignan Farms Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 308 ; (2007) 157 FCR 387 at [38] to [42]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 668">The respondents argue that the defect is remediable under s.306 and the applicants were not misled. But the test of whether or not a defect is misleading is an objective one; James v Commissioner of Taxation (supra) at 644. In this particular case Southern Cross could not give a good discharge for any monies received because it was not entitled to them. It seems to me that the applicants would be misled by the notice because it required them to make out the cheque to three persons, only two of whom had a claim upon them. See Dimasi t/as F &amp; M Dimasi &amp; Anor v Nangiloc Colignan Farms Pty Limited [2007] FCA 308 ; (2007) 239 ALR 330. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 229">Ronald Royce McClelland in addition relied on Dimasi v Nangiloc Colignan Farms Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 308 ; (2007) 157 FCR 387. In that case, Ryan J upheld a decision of McInnis FM, who had held that a bankruptcy notice against two joint debtors could be valid against one of the debtors even if it was invalid against the other. The second debtor had been named as Michelina Dimasi when in fact her name was Maria Dimasi. McInnis FM held that the bankruptcy notice was incurably misleading as against her, but not as against her husband, who was correctly named as Frank Dimasi. Ryan J held that it had been open to McInnis FM to find that the defect in Ms Dimasi's name was capable of misleading her. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1452">5 The Application was filed in this Court on 29 February 2008. That Application seeks an order setting aside the Bankruptcy Notice . The power of this Court to set aside a bankruptcy notice was not questioned: Re Sterling; Ex parte Esanda Ltd [1980] FCA 61 ; (1980) 30 ALR 77 at 83 per Lockhart J; Dimasi v Nangiloc Colignan Farms Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 308 at [25] , [2007] FCA 308 ; 239 ALR 330 at 337 per Ryan J. </sentence>
