Therefore, in interpreting the Award the Court must:

80 More recently, French J has revisited the issue of the interpretation of an award while sitting in the Federal Court in the The City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal Administrative Clerical and Services Union [2006] FCA 813 ; (2006) 153 IR 426. Having stated the principles concerning the construction of statutes, his Honour said at [57]:
 
 
 It is of course necessary, in the construction of an award, to remember, as a contextual consideration, that it is an award under consideration. Its words must not be interpreted in a vacuum divorced from industrial realities - City of Wanneroo v Holmes [1989] FCA 369 ; (1989) 30 IR 362 at 378---379 and cases there cited. There is a long tradition of generous construction over a strictly literal approach where industrial awards are concerned - see eg Geo A Bond and Co Ltd (in liq) v McKenzie [1929] AR 499 at 503---4 ( Street J). It may be that this means no more than that courts and tribunals will not make too much of infelicitous expression in the drafting of an award nor be astute to discern absurdity or illogicality or apparent inconsistencies. But while fractured and illogical prose may be met by a generous and liberal approach to construction, I repeat what I said in City of Wanneroo v Holmes (at 380): 
 


 
Awards, whether made by consent or otherwise, should make sense according to the basic conventions of the English language. They bind the parties on pain of pecuniary penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 579">In City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union [2006] FCA 813 French J addressed the approach to the interpretation of an award. The general principles outlined must also be applicable to a NAPSA given the nature and source of such provisions. Thus, as French J stated at [53] the construction of an award or instrument: ... begins with a consideration of the ordinary meaning of its words. ... regard must be paid to the context and purpose of the provision or expression being construed. Context may appear from the text of the instrument taken as a whole, its arrangement and the place in it of the provision under construction. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 643">The following propositions should be accepted. 
(a) A practical approach to the interpretation of instruments generated by Schedule 8 should be adopted, consistent with the approach adopted by Madgwick J in Kucks v CSR Ltd (1996) 66 IR 182 at 184 to awards and by French J in City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union [2006] FCA 813 ; (2006) 153 IR 426 at 440 to industrial agreements. (b) Such transitional instruments are to be interpreted and understood in context. That context includes the entire document but, naturally enough, extends also to the industrial circumstances giving rise to the original instrument: cf. Amcor Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Engineering Union [2005] HCA 10 ; (2005) 222 CLR 241 at 246[2] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 518">In City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union [2006] FCA 813 ; (2006) 153 IR 426 French J (as he then was) observed at [51]: 
 An award made under the Act is not a law but, when made, its provisions are given the force of a law of the Commonwealth: 
 In effect the statute enacts by the prescribed constitutional method the provision contained in the award. Ex parte McLean (1930) 43 CLR 472 at 479 (Isaacs and Starke JJ).

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1447">(b) In these circumstances, by operation of ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement were binding on AMRS. Counsel for Mr Urquhart referred to the 1965 Award, 1969 Variations, the National Wage Cases , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement in support of his submission that, whilst employed by AMRS, Mr Urquhart was entitled to be paid wages and superannuation at the rate for which the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement provided, and not at the rate he was in fact paid by AMRS, but with the loading prescribed by the 1998 Award. He referred to the principles for interpreting awards in various cases, including in City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union [2006] FCA 813 ; (2006) 153 IR 426. He contended that, properly construed, the underpayment that Mr Urquhart claimed in his relief (see [4]) included the loading for which the 1998 Award provided calculated by reference to the 1999 and 2002 certified agreement rates (as well as the difference between the amounts for which these certified agreements provided and that which he was actually paid). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 954">59 The resolution of the question of construction posed by the competing submissions is not easy. The many provisions referred to in argument are not free from the ' apparent inconsistencies ', if not ' illogicality ', that often characterise collective agreements negotiated between employers and employees' organisations: cf City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union [2006] FCA 813 ; (2006) 153 IR 426 , at 440 [57], per French J. The difficulties of construction are compounded by the fact that the AMOU Agreement does not specifically (let alone unambiguously) address whether or not SFC needs the prior agreement of AMOU to introduce crew based rosters. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 429">For reasons such as these, expressions which have been held in the case of other instruments to have been used to mean particular things may sensibly and properly be held to mean something else in the document at hand. " 16. Finally, on this issue the Court was also referred to the decision in City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union (2006) FCA 813 , at [57] where French J, said: "It is of course necessary, in the construction of an award, to remember, as a contextual consideration, that it is an award under consideration.

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 464">5 His Honour noted that there was no dispute about the facts. His Honour cited a number of authorities on the construction of awards: Short v FW Hercus Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 51 ; (1993) 40 FCR 511 at 520; Kucks v CSR Limited (1996) 66 IR 181 at 184 and City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Unions [2006] FCA 813 at [57] . In the latter case French J referred to an observation in his earlier decision City of Wanneroo v Holmes [1989] FCA 369 ; (1989) 30 IR 362 at 380:
 Awards, whether made by consent or otherwise, should make sense according to the basic conventions of the English language. They bind the parties on pain of pecuniary penalties. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FMCA 2084">In City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical And Services Union [2006] FCA 813 His Honour French J referred again to the decision extracted at paragraph 22 above and at [57] said: "It is of course necessary, in the construction of an award, to remember, as a contextual consideration, that it is an award under consideration. Its words must not be interpreted in a vacuum divorced from industrial realities --- City of Wanneroo v Holmes [1989] FCA 369 ; (1989) 30 IR 362 at 378-379 and cases there cited. There is a long tradition of generous construction over a strictly literal approach where industrial awards are concerned --- see eg Geo A Bond and Co Ltd (in liq) v McKenzie [1929] AR 499 at 503-4 (Street J). It may be that this means no more than that courts and tribunals will not make too much of infelicitous expression in the drafting of an award nor be astute to discern absurdity or logicality or apparent inconsistencies. 
 But while fractured and illogical prose may be met by a generous and liberal approach to construction, I repeat what I said in City of Wanneroo v Holmes (at 380): ' Awards, whether made by consent or otherwise, should make sense according to the basic conventions of the English language. They bind the parties on pain of pecuniary penaltie s.' </sentence>

<sentence id="cs16" from="[2007] FCAFC 137">110 French J discussed the proper approach to the interpretation of an award in City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union [2006] FCA 813 at [50] - [57]. His Honour made the point that it is not necessary to identify an ambiguity in the language under consideration before regard may be had to the purpose of the award.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2007] FCA 435">Very frequently, perhaps most often, the immediate context is the clearest guide, but the court should not deny itself all other guidance in those cases where it can be seen that more is needed. In literature, Milton and Joyce could not be read in ignorance of the source of their language, nor should a legal document, including an award, be so read. ' 
 

I also refer to, without repeating, the observations of French J in City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union [2006] FCA 813 ; (2006) 153 IR 426 at [50] - [57] . </sentence>
