 6. The previous Tribunal (first Tribunal) decision made on 5 February 2002 was reviewed in the following: 
 
 
 a) Applicant S105/2003 v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 125 (16 January 2006) per Scarlett FM;
 b) Applicant S105/2003 v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 639 (9 May 2006) per Young J;
 c) Applicant S105/2003 v Minister for Immigration [2006] HCATrans 701 (14 December 2006) per Hayne and Crennan JJ.  
 
 5. On 20 April 2007, solicitors for the first respondent filed an amended response containing the following: 
 
 
 1. the four grounds of the application do not disclose an arguable jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's decision. 
 2. there is no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's decision because: 
 

 (a) the Tribunal is functus officio because it has previously reviewed the decision of the delegate of the First Respondent dated 20 October 1999 
 
 PARTICULARS 
 
 (i) the Tribunal previously reviewed the decision of the delegate of the first respondent made in respect of the applicant and handed down its decision on 5 February 2002 (first Tribunal's decision). 
 
 (ii) the first Tribunal's decision was not found to contain any jurisdictional error: NADI v MIMIA [2002] FCA 649 ; NADI of 2002 v MIMIA [2002] FCA 1055; S105 of 2003 v MIMA [2006] FMCA 125 ; Applicant S105/2003 [2006] FCA 639 ; and Applicant S105/2003 v MIMA &amp; Anor [2006] HCA Trans 701. 
 
 (b) The Tribunal was therefore correct to find that it did not have jurisdiction to review the delegate's decision.
