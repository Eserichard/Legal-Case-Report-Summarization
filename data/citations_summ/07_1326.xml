<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] ACTSC 133"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1016">A question arises whether, in considering s 25(2B)(aa), it is necessary for the Court to also have recourse to s 31A. In a number of cases the Court has exercised power pursuant to s 25(2B)(aa) and given summary judgment without reference to s 31A: Druett v Department of Families, Community Services &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 995 , Zambini v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1773 , Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 1326 , Rana v University of Adelaide (No 2) [2008] FCA 941. However in other cases the Court has linked the power under s 25(2B)(aa) to the jurisdiction of the Court under s 31A and summarily dismissed an appeal on the basis that the appellant had no reasonable prospect of success in prosecuting its grounds of appeal: Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 923 , Bishop v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1118. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 601">In the present appeal there is a legitimate basis upon which the application is being advanced by the Respondent. Left to one side when considering the merits of the present application to dismiss for want of prosecution have been such factors as the commencement by the present Appellant of a District Court proceeding. That proceeding was commenced subsequent to the service of the petition. Its procedural course was the subject of criticism by the Federal Magistrates Court. Such factors have been left to one side, as the " want of prosecution " to which O 52 r 38(1)(a) is directed is a want of prosecution of the " appeal "; defaults or procedural irregularities in other proceedings may appear to assume little (if any) immediate relevance when that provision is invoked. In the present appeal, the Appellant failed to file an index to the Appeal Book , to prepare an Appeal Book or to file submissions as directed. After the Notice of Appeal was filed in this Court on 19 January 2009, the Appellant took no step --- or certainly undertook inadequate steps --- prior to 17 April and 5 May 2009 to ensure that her appeal would be ready for hearing. As was the case in Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 1326 at [17] , the present Appellant has been extended " every opportunity to litigate [her] complaints " and " considerable procedural leeway " has been extended to her. The present case is also in some ways comparable to NBCI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 280 where Ryan, Merkel and Conti JJ dismissed an appeal pursuant to O 52 r 38(1)(a) for like failures by the there appellant, those failures being characterised by their Honours as " successive and cavalier omissions ". </sentence>
