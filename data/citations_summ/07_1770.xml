<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1989">22 I am satisfied by the affidavit of Amy Joanne Beaumont sworn 5 December 2008 that Singapore is not a party to any convention treaty or other agreement in force between Australia and it, for the service of documents in civil proceedings and that the position, with respect to India, remains the same as that which I found in Beluga (No 2) [2007] FCA 1770 [6], namely that there is, likewise, no relevant convention or other means under O 8 r 3(3), for the service of the proceedings in India. The proceedings may thus be served in both Singapore and India by private agents, which is what the Suzlon companies seek to do.</sentence>
