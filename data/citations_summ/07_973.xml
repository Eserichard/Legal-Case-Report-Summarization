<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 27">The Commission submitted that by exposing CIL to these circumstances, Mr Narain failed to exercise a degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person acting as a managing director and chief executive officer of CIL would exercise and that he thereby contravened s 180(1) of the Act. The Commission relied in particular in support of this submission on Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Maxwell [2006] NSWSC 1052 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 373 at [104] , [105], [110] and [144] and Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Warrenmang Limited [2007] FCA 973 at pars [23] and [24]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 645">Whether those instructions will result in a fair criminal trial may be strongly doubted. Last, but by no means least, is the falsification point made by Fryberg J which, if it occurs, will bring the law into disrepute.
