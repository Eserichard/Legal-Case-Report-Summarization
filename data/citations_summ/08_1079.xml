<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1208">The Court has the power under s 1325A(2)(b)(i) , in these circumstances, to make orders of the kind which are sought by the plaintiff. The Court has, in a number of recent cases, exercised that power in similar circumstances to those prevailing in this case. (See, Re Grain Corp Ltd [2008] FCA 996 ; Re McMahon Holdings Ltd [2008] FCA 1079 ; and Re Venturex Resources Ltd [2009] FCA 677 ; (2009) 177 FCR 391. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1207">The Court has the power under s 1325A(2)(b)(i) , in these circumstances, to make orders of the kind which are sought by the plaintiff. The Court has in a number of recent cases, exercised that power in similar circumstances to those prevailing in this case. (See, Re Grain Corp Ltd [2008] FCA 996 ; Re McMahon Holdings Ltd [2008] FCA 1079 ; and Re Venturex Resources Ltd [2009] FCA 677 ; (2009) 177 FCR 391. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 955">In this regard, s 1322(4) may be contrasted with s 1325D under which the Court may declare any act, document or matter not invalid by reason of contravention of a provision of Ch 6, 6A, 6B or 6C, where regard must be had to whether the contravention was caused by a person's inadvertence or mistake, not having been aware of the relevant fact or occurrence, or circumstances beyond the control of the person. In my view, it is clear that mere "inadvertence" is not the sole or a governing criterion by which the Court may be moved to exercise its power under s 1322(4)(d), even though such a factor may be considered relevant. There is no doubt that s 1322 is intended to be exercised liberally, so as not to unreasonably stifle corporate and financial activity; that is to say, restrict such activity merely on technical grounds: Winpar Holdings Ltd v Goldfields Kalgoorlie Ltd [2001] NSWCA 427 ; (2001) 166 FLR 144 , Giles JA (with whom Beazley JA agreed) at [74]; Re Insurance Australia Group Ltd [2003] FCA 581 ; (2003) 128 FCR 581 at [27] per Lindgren J; R e Wave Capital Limited [2003] NSWCA 71 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 1 , 995, French J at [30]; Re MacMahon Holdings Limited [2008] FCA 1079 , McKerracher J at [21]. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 698">As to what conduct on the part of an applicant may be considered disentitling conduct in relation to the exercise of the Court's power, it is not appropriate to delimit the possibly relevant categories. Each case will suggest circumstances perhaps which should lead to the power not being exercised. Delay may be relevant in some cases: see Re Laserbond Ltd [2007] NSWCA 183 ; (2003) 25 ACLC 1 , 658; Re Insurance Australia Group Limited [2003] FCA 581 ; (2003) 128 FCR 581 ; Re MacMahon Holdings Ltd [2008] FCA 1079 , McKerracher J at [15]. Similarly, "Evidence of a blatant disregard of the provisions of the Act or the constitution of the company may lead to refusal of relief": Re Wave Capital Limited [2003] NSWCA 71 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 1 , 995, French J at [29].  In response, counsel for Blaze submits it is well established that:- 
 Section 1322(4) is a source of power for making remedial orders where there has been a contravention of the bid variation provisions of the CA: Pinnacle at [17] --- [19] and [25]; and see the decision of Mullins J in the Supreme Court of Queensland in Barondene Pty Ltd v Breakfree Ltd (2003) 22 ACLC 910 at 912. So is s 1325D: Pinnacle at [17] --- [19]. 

 Primelife Corporation Limited v Aevum Ltd [2005] NSWSC 269 ; (2005) 53 ACSR 283 , Hamilton J, particularly at [8]; Re McMahon Holdings Limited [2008] FCA 1079.  There is no doubt that s 1322 is intended to be exercised liberally, so as not to unreasonably stifle corporate and financial activity; that is to say, restrict such activity merely on technical grounds: Winpar Holdings Ltd v Goldfields Kalgoorlie Ltd [2001] NSWCA 427 ; (2001) 166 FLR 144 , Giles JA (with whom Beazley JA agreed) at [74]; Re Insurance Australia Group Ltd [2003] FCA 581 ; (2003) 128 FCR 581 at [27] per Lindgren J; Re Wave Capital Limited [2003] NSWCA 71 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 1 , 995, French J at [30]; Re MacMahon Holdings Limited [2008] FCA 1079 , McKerracher J at [21]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 677">As I observed in relevantly similar circumstances in MacMahon Holdings [2008] FCA 1079 , in such a situation the primary consideration would appear to be the interest of offerees. The intent of the subsection must be to ensure that those accepting the offer, receive the benefit of that which they have accepted. As in Re Pinnacle VRB Ltd (No 9) [2001] ATP 25 and Re Pinnacle VRB Ltd (No 10) [2001] ATP 21 , the acceptors/offerees would be prejudiced if after acceptance of the offer the bidder did not proceed with an application to have the relevant shares quoted on the ASX.  Finally, although this point has not been squarely considered in other cases, the approach I propose to take is consistent with the similar circumstances in GrainCorp Limited, in the matter of GrainCorp Limited [2008] FCA 996 and In the matter of MacMahon Holdings Limited (ACN 007 634 406) [2008] FCA 1079. </sentence>
