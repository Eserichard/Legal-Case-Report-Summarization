<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1">32 The respondent's reliance upon cases such as Hatzimanolis v ANI Corporation Ltd [1992] HCA 21 ; (1992) 173 CLR 473 , Danvers v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1969] HCA 64 ; (1969) 122 CLR 529 and Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission v Clark [2006] FCA 306 was said to be misconceived because those cases dealt with 'in the course of employment' rather than 'arising out of employment', and in any case, were concerned with injuries which occurred in an interval or interlude within an overall period of work, rather than in intervals between such periods, as here. The respondent's reliance upon Repatriation Commission v Tuite [1993] FCA 39 ; (1993) 39 FCR 540 and Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission v Wall [2005] FCAFC 127 ; (2006) 88 ALD 1 was said to be misplaced as those cases concerned factors/incidents which occurred in the course of employment and which were held to have actually influenced the self-harming behaviour (smoking) which led, in turn, to injury. Furthermore, the respondent's reliance on Darling Island Stevedoring &amp; Lighterage Co Ltd v Hankinson [1967] HCA 10 ; (1967) 117 CLR 19 was also said to be misplaced because it deals with 'a different problem in causation'. Finally, the decision in Federal Broom Co Pty Ltd v Semlitch [1964] HCA 34 ; (1964) 110 CLR 626 was said to support the applicant's, rather than the respondent's, case. </sentence>
