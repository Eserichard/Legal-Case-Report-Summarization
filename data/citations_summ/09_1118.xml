9 The appellant contended that Reid-Frost was contrary to a decision of another court that the Commission was bound to follow. The essential ground on which the appellant relied for a review of the decision in Reid-Frost was that Reid-Frost was decided per incuriam and in conflict with established natural justice or procedural fairness principle, as there was no reference to the NSW Court of Appeal majority judgments of Street CJ and Moffitt P in Parramatta City Council v Hale (1982) 47 LGRA 319 or to the Federal Court judgment of Graham J in Lohse v Arthur (No 3) [2009] FCA 1118 ; (2009) 188 IR 205 , which it was contended, provided 'a comprehensive and useful guidance as to natural justice and procedural fairness principles in the context of employment law and a public sector decision-maker. ' It was submitted that the Commission was bound by the approach and principles in Parramatta City Council or the NSW Court of Appeal's guidance should be applied because that Court is in the Commission's appellate hierarchy.</sentence>
