<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 836">Mr Perry SC, who appeared for the applicants, relied upon Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin [2003] VSC 123 ; (2003) 46 ACSR 126 at 214-215 [386] per Mandie J the report of which indicates that in that case an accountant, Mr Humphris, "agreed that a checklist of matters put to him as being indicators of insolvency, was a fairly extensive list, albeit in general terms, and brought to mind very common features in insolvency situations". It was submitted that that checklist of indicators of insolvency had been applied by Reeves J in Playspace Playground Pty Ltd v Osborn [2009] FCA 1486 at [41]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSC 136">[3] 
 23 I am not persuaded that the administrator's view that the Church was insolvent at the time of his appointment and remains insolvent should not be accepted because of the valuation of the properties. Importantly, the administrator in forming his view took into account that the Church has assets in the form of land that exceeds the value of the liabilities of the Church. 24 The applicable principles for determining solvency were summarised succinctly in Playspace Playground Pty Ltd v Osborn [4] where Reeves J stated: 
 
 
 Section 95A of the Act provides that a person is solvent: "... if, and only if, the person is able to pay all the person's debts, as and when they become due and payable". It also provides that a person who is not solvent, is insolvent. As Mandie J observed in Plymin (at [370]), this is the "cash flow test" of insolvency.</sentence>
