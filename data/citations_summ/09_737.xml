<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 984">It may be an indication of the content of the article and that is not sufficient (cf "The Lawyer's Diary" for a diary). (See generally Copinger at [3---16] and Laddie et al at [3.62]. ) It may be a grouping of words that convey, in themselves, the subject matter such that the expression was inseparable from the idea conveyed ("Help-Help-Driver-in-danger-Call-Police-Ph.000" in State of Victoria v Pacific Technologies (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 737 ; (2009) 177 FCR 61). In each case it was determined that the contended work did not justify claims of copyright protection, although the reasoning was not identical. In Lamb v Evans [1893] 1 Ch 218 , the "headings" in which copyright was held to subsist were more than mere headlines.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 44">The Copyright Act does not protect facts, ideas or information contained in a work, to ensure a balance is struck between the interests of authors and those in society: IceTV 254 ALR 386 at [28] and the cases cited therein. The Copyright Act does not provide protection for skill and labour alone: IceTV [2009] HCA 14 ; 254 ALR 386 at [49] , [52], [54] and [131]. The Copyright Act protects the particular form of expression of the information: IceTV [2009] HCA 14 ; 254 ALR 386 at [26] , [28], [40], [70], [102] and [160]; Hollinrake v Truswell [1894] 3 Ch 420 at 424 per Lord Herschell LC; Victoria v Pacific Technologies (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 737 ; (2009) 177 FCR 61 at [17] per Emmett J; see also Larrikin Music Publishing Pty Ltd v EMI Songs Australia Pty Limited [2010] FCA 29 at [40], [41] and [212]. Copyright is not given to reward work distinct from the production of a particular form of expression: IceTV [2009] HCA 14 ; 254 ALR 386 at [28] and [31]. Accordingly, it is "unhelpful to refer to the 'commercial value' of the information, because that directs attention to the information itself rather than to the particular form of expression": IceTV [2009] HCA 14 ; 254 ALR 386 at [31] and [166]. As explained above (see [20(6)]), originality is closely tied to authorship. It requires that works originate with an author and that "the creation (that is the production) of the work [involve] some independent intellectual effort, but neither literary merit nor novelty or inventiveness as required in patent law": IceTV 254 ALR 386 at [33] and [48]. This view is consistent with a long line of authority: see University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 601 at 608-609 per Peterson J; Robinson v Sands &amp; McDougall Pty Ltd [1916] HCA 51 ; (1916) 22 CLR 124 at 132-133 per Barton J; Sands &amp; McDougall Pty Ltd v Robinson [1917] HCA 14 ; (1917) 23 CLR 49 at 52 per Isaacs J; Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor [1937] HCA 45 ; (1937) 58 CLR 479 at 511 per Dixon J; Football League Ltd v Littlewoods Pools Ltd [1959] Ch 637 at 651 per Upjohn J; Autodesk Inc v Dyason [1992] HCA 2 ; (1992) 173 CLR 330 at 347 per Dawson J; Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 379 per Gummow J; Data Access Corporation v Powerflex Services Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 49 ; (1999) 202 CLR 1 at [22] , [95] and [122] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Sawkins v Hyperion Records Ltd [2005] EWHC 403 ; (2005) 64 IPR 627 at [31] per Mummery LJ; Victoria v Pacific Technologies (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 737 ; (2009) 177 FCR 61 at [18] per Emmett J. </sentence>
