<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 498">The applicants submit that the Mt Goldsworthy Leases are not relevantly distinguishable from other mining leases which have been found not to be inconsistent with all native title rights. For example, the Hamersley Range lease, of comparable size and importance and granted pursuant to a Western Australian Agreement Act was considered in Daniel No 1. That Agreement Act contained clauses strikingly similar to the Mt Goldsworthy Agreement Act, including the statement in both leases that the leaseholders are to hold the said land and mine, and the provision for extensive mining-associated infrastructure and other infrastructure that included towns, schools, a harbour and wharf development. Despite this, Nicholson J considered that the rights granted by the Hamersley Range lease did not amount to exclusive possession so as to extinguish all native title rights. As mentioned above, the tenement holders and the State submit that his Honour's conclusions as to mineral leases do not assist as his Honour did not fully consider the application of the "inconsistency of incidents" test in relation to the Hamersley Range Lease. Those parties submit that cases where the test was not applied (eg Rubibi Community v Western Australia (No 7) [2006] FCA 459) are, similarly, not of assistance. I have considered Nicholson J's reasons and have taken them into account in coming to an understanding of the principles derived from Ward and applied in Daniel No 1 and No 2. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCAFC 78">215 In considering the respective contentions, and in the light of the authorities which have been discussed, we propose to apply the following general approach. It is largely a matter of common sense, but is founded upon the words of s 47A and s 47B in their context and as considered in the authorities:
 
 (1) to "occupy" an area for the purposes of ss 47A and 47B of the NTA involves the exercise of some physical activity or activities in relation to the area;
 (2) to "occupy" an area does not require the performance of an activity or activities on every part of the land;
 (3) to "occupy" an area does not necessarily involve consistently or repeatedly performing the activity or activities over part of the area;
 (4) to "occupy" an area does not require constant performance of the activity or activities over parts of the area; it is possible to conclude that an area is occupied where there are spasmodic or occasional physical activities carried on over the area;
 (5) to occupy an area at a particular time does not necessarily require contemporaneous activity on that area at the particular time; it is possible to conclude that an area of land is occupied in circumstances where at the time the application is made there is no immediately contemporaneous activity being carried on in the area;
 (6) the fact of occupation does not necessarily entail a frequent physical presence in the area; for example, the storage of sacred objects on the area or the holding, from time to time, of traditional ceremonies on the area may constitute occupation for the purposes of the NTA: see, e.g. Rubibi Community v Western Australia [2001] FCA 607 ; (2001) 112 FCR 409 at [182] ;
 (7) evidence to establish occupation need not necessarily be confined to evidence of activities occurring on the particular area; it may be possible to establish that a particular area is occupied by reference to occupation of a wider area which includes the particular area: Risk [2006] FCA 404 at 890;
 (8) occupation need not be "traditional": Rubibi (No 7) [2006] FCA 459 at [84] ;
 (9) whether occupation has been made out in a particular case is always a question of fact and degree.  214 It was accepted by the parties that the "area" of which s 47B(1)(c) speaks is the "particular area in relation to which it has been concluded that, but for the section, native title rights would be extinguished": Neowarra [2003] FCA 1402 at [721] ; Rubibi (No 7) [2006] FCA 459 at [71] . Merkel J also said in Rubibi (No 7) that "the occupation that must be established for the purposes of s 47B(1)(c) must also be an occupation in respect of the whole, rather than merely a part, of the particular area in respect of which, but for s 47B, native title rights would be extinguished": at [72]. 132 Similarly, in Rubibi (No 7) [2006] FCA 459 Merkel J held that certain freehold titles held by associations incorporated under the ACA Act were held expressly for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples for the purposes of s 47A. His Honour described the relevant legislative provisions and association Rules or Constitutions as follows (at [93] and [94]):
 
 The ACA Act is stated to provide 'for the Constitution of Aboriginal Councils and the Incorporation of Associations of Aboriginals and for matters connected therewith'. Section 3 defines an 'Aboriginal association' as an association, society or body whose eligibility for membership is limited to Aboriginals and spouses of Aboriginals. 210 Whether an area is "occupied" by one or more members of a claim group is a factual inquiry which must be considered in the context of each individual case. It cannot be simply equated with connection: see Risk [2006] FCA 404 at [890] per Mansfield J; Rubibi (No 7) [2006] FCA 459 at [83] per Merkel J. The Ngarluma and Yindjibarndi peoples and the State are agreed that the learned primary judge erred insofar as he held otherwise. The State submitted that by equating occupation with connection, his Honour failed to determine the fact of occupation in relation to the disputed areas, so that s 47B cannot be satisfied in respect of them regardless of whether his Honour also erred in relation to the effect of the temporary reserves. The error of law was said to be one which precluded the primary judge from making the relevant factual findings. 222 In relation to Keith Churnside's evidence of fishing by boat "out to sea", that evidence may be capable of supporting an inference of travel over, and use of, the adjacent land. That occupation of an area can be inferred from evidence of activity in its vicinity was confirmed by the Full Court in Alyawarr (FC) [2005] FCAFC 135 ; 145 FCR 442 at [196] (cf Neowarra [2003] FCA 1402 at [744] ). We note, however, that in Rubibi (No 7) [2006] FCA 459 Merkel J said that occupation of an area requires something more than mere use of or visitation to the area: at [78]. 207 In Hayes [1999] FCA 1248 ; 97 FCR 32 , Olney J observed at 144, [162] that occupancy of land for the purposes of ss 47A and 47B "should be understood in the sense that the indigenous people have traditionally occupied land. " His Honour expressed the view that the use of particular land by members of the relevant claimant group which is not random nor co-incidental, but in accordance with the traditional way of life, habits, customs and usages of the community is sufficient to indicate occupation of the land. His Honour's views have been approved in several subsequent decisions of this Court: see, e.g. Griffiths v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 903 at [662] and [703]; Risk [2006] FCA 404 at [888] ; Rubibi (No 7) [2006] FCA 459 at [81] . 128 The phrase "held expressly for the benefit of...Aboriginal peoples" in the first limb of s 47A(1)(b)(ii) of the NTA has been considered on several occasions at first instance and by the Full Court of this Court. The Ngarluma and Yindjibarndi peoples rely on the decisions of Sundberg J in Neowarra [2003] FCA 1402 and Merkel J in Rubibi Community v State of Western Australia (No 7) [2006] FCA 459 ( Rubibi (No 7) ) . In Neowarra , Sundberg J held that several pastoral leases held by the Indigenous Land Corporation (the ILC) satisfied the same limb of s 47A(1)(b)(ii). The ILC was established under s 191A of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 (Cth) (the ATSIC Act) to assist Aboriginal persons to acquire land and manage it: see Neowarra at [676], [709] and [712]-[713].</sentence>
