<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 224">In Re Investa Properties Limited [2007] FCA 1104 Lindgren J approved a no encumbrance provision qualified, as is the case here, by the phrase "to the extent permitted by law". His Honour discussed, at [25]-[28] the limits of such a clause and, in a statement with which I respectfully agree, concluded at [30]: 
 
 I regarded the opening words "To the extent permitted by law" as giving adequate notice that a third party would not suffer the extinguishment of an interest in shares if Morgan Stanley Bidco had had notice of that interest. I therefore took the view that those words overcame the difficulty referred to in WebCentral [2006] FCA 1203 ; 58 ACSR 742 , which was that the presence of a vesting free of encumbrances term might give the impression to third parties that their interests had been extinguished by the presence of the term where they would not have been in its absence.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 211">The Scheme provides that each Scheme Shareholder is deemed to have warranted that on the date of the transfer, all their shares will be "fully paid and free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances, pledges, security interests and other interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise". Provisions of that kind are common and have not been seen to constitute a problem: APN News &amp; Media Limited at [57]---[63]; Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 at [21] . The warranty is disclosed in section 7.5 of the Scheme Booklet. Evidence necessary for a first court hearing

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1388">The Scheme provides that each Scheme Shareholder is deemed to have warranted that on the date of the transfer, all their shares will be "fully paid and free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances, pledges, security interests and other interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise".

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1309">I was of the view that the above provisions meant scheme shareholders were adequately protected against any credit or performance risk ( Re SFE Corp Ltd [2006] FCA 670 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 82 ; Re APN News and Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 (" Re APN News and Media "); Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1186). The deemed warranty
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 1263">A scheme of arrangement typically has elements that are compulsory for members, even those who may not vote in favour of the scheme, such as the requirement in this Scheme that all members transfer their Aldridge shares to Vetter and AWH in exchange for shares in AWH and Vetter (see Re Victorian Grain Services Ltd [2000] VSC 334 ; (2000) 35 ACSR 198 ; Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 10">The Scheme contains clauses commonly seen in schemes made pursuant to Pt 5.1 of the Corporations Act . The 'no encumbrances' clause (cl 5.4(a)) is to the same effect as the clause approved in Investa Properties Limited, in the matter of Investa Properties Limited [2007] FCA 1104. The deemed warranty clause is the same in substance as that which was approved in Re APN News &amp; Media Limited (2007) 25 ACLC 7840 at [57]-[63] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 1588">A similarly worded clause was considered by Lindgren J in Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1186. His Honour referred at [22] of his reasons to a "vesting free of encumbrances" term that he had considered in WebCentral Group Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 1203 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 742 and to his concerns that third parties having interests in the shares might be given the impression that their interests were being adversely affected. The relevant clause in WebCentral did not contain the qualification emphasised in the above quotation of cl 8.3(b). This qualification did appear in the "vesting free of encumbrances" term his Honour considered in Investa . In approving the clause containing the qualification his Honour made the following comments at [28] and [30] of his reasons: 
 
 Apparently the purpose of a vesting free of encumbrances term is only to make clear, as is the position under general law principles, that the acquiring company takes the shares free of equitable interests of which it was unaware. ... I regarded the opening words "To the extent permitted by law" as giving adequate notice that a third party would not suffer the extinguishment of an interest in shares if [the transferee] had had notice of that interest. I therefore took the view that those words overcame the difficulty referred to in WebCentral [2006] FCA 1203 ; 58 ACSR 742 , which was that the presence of a vesting free of encumbrances term might give the impression to third parties that their interests had been extinguished by the presence of the term where they would not have been in its absence. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 484">The third matter is the presence in the scheme of a "no incumbrances" provision. Provisions of this kind have been the subject of a number of decisions, stemming from Lindgren J's decision in Re WebCentral Group Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1203 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 742 ( WebCentral ). I followed WebCentral in the cases of Re Metals Exploration Limited [2007] FCA 84 and Re Uranium King Limited (No 3) [2008] FCA 1196 ; (2008) 67 ACSR 513. The concern in relation to the "no incumbrances" clauses, the subject of those decisions, was that third party interests might be affected by the presence of such a clause. However, in the case of Re Investa Properties Limited [2007] FCA 1104 ( Investa Properties ), Lindgren J considered whether the inclusion of the words "to the extent permitted by law" at the commencement of the "no incumbrances" clause would be sufficient to overcome the potential difficulties for third parties. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] VSC 154">This is comparable to other recent proposed schemes of arrangement, such as Symbion Health's scheme which had a 6 month lock up period, with Symbion Health having discretion to extend this period up to 9 months;
 
b. there is, as required by Santow J, a carve out in relation to directors' fiduciary duties --- see clause 16.3 of the SIA, which provides for carve outs where either the Dyno Nobel Board or the Incitec Pivot Board has:
 
determined, in good faith and acting reasonably, that failing to respond in any way to that Competing Proposal for Incitec Pivot would be likely to cause the [Dyno Nobel/Incitec Pivot] Directors to breach their fiduciary duties;
 
c. both Dyno Nobel and Incitec Pivot considered that this clause was a prerequisite to entry into the SIA (see clause 16.4 of the SIA); and
 
d. the exclusivity period has been adequately disclosed in the explanatory statement to go to shareholders and optionholders --- see section 1.9 of the draft Scheme Booklet. No encumbrance 
 
(8) Clause 4.4 of the Share Scheme provides that:
 
To the extent permitted by law, all of the Scheme Shares will vest in [Incitec US Holdings] free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise, and restrictions on transfer of any kind. (9) This type of clause has been accepted by the Federal Court in several recent cases, including Re Investa Properties Limited [9] and HPAL Limited [10] . We also understand that, although not referred to in the judgments, there was a similar clause in the Coles scheme of arrangement (clause 4.2(b) of the Coles scheme of arrangement) which was approved by Robson J recently: see Re Coles Group Limited [11] ( Coles Group No 1 ) and Re Coles Group No 2. [12] 
 
 Deemed warranty 
 
(10) Clause 8.6 of the Share Scheme states that:
 
Each Scheme Participant is deemed to have warranted to [Incitec US Holdings] that all of their Scheme Shares (including any rights and entitlements attaching to those shares) will, at the date of the transfer of them to [Incitec US Holdings], be fully paid and free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise, and restrictions on transfer of any kind, and that they have full power and capacity to sell and to transfer their Scheme Shares together with any rights and entitlements attaching to such shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 2080">24 In my view, the presence of the exclusivity and break fee provisions in the MID should not stand in the way of the Anzon Energy Shareholders having the opportunity to consider the Anzon Energy Scheme: see Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [25] - [55] ; Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1186 at [31] - [35] ; Re Bolnisi Gold NL [2007] FCA 1668 at [25] - [26]. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FCA 2078">9 I discussed break fees and other "deal protection" measures, notably "no shop" or exclusivity period provisions, in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 ( APN ) at [25]---[55] and to a lesser extent in Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1186 at [31] ---[35], and will not repeat what I said in those cases. Generally, a break fee is a fee payable by the target company to the acquiring company in certain circumstances in which the acquisition is not implemented. Such provisions form part of a merger implementation agreement to which the directors of the target company commit their company prior to a scheme of arrangement being considered by the target company's shareholders. When deciding whether to order that a meeting be convened or that a scheme be approved, the Court is not in a position to decide whether a merger implementation agreement was entered into in breach of the duties owed by the target company's directors. The Court could do so only on a contested hearing in which it is alleged, and sought to be proved, that by committing the target company to the merger implementation agreement, the directors breached their statutory and general law duties: see eg, Idameneo (No 123) Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Limited [2007] FCA 1832. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FCA 1668">25 I discussed no shop and no talk and break free provisions in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [25] ---[55] and in Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 at [31] ---[35]. In the present case, Norman Alfred Seckold, the Chairman and a Director of Bolnisi, states as follows in his affidavit of 25 October 2007: 
 
 
 22. Clause 12 of the Merger Implementation Agreement between Bolnisi and Coeur ... is an exclusivity provision which provides that, during the exclusivity period, competing third party proposals are not to be sought and discussions or negotiations may not be entered into in relation to a third party proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] VSC 389">44 Mr Bathurst submitted that Lindgren J adopted the same approach to a similar provision in Re Investa Properties Ltd [22] . Mr Bathurst has submitted that the approach taken by Lindgren J is to be preferred and that the deemed warranty contained in clause 9.3 of the Scheme is unobjectionable. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FCA 1570">5 Mr Oakes pointed out that there are no novel jurisdictional or procedural issues that fall within the disclosure principle described by Barrett J in Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd (2002) 43 ASCR 601 at [7]. Nevertheless, Mr Oakes drew my attention to a number of aspects of the scheme. I am satisfied that the structure of the scheme which was explained fully to me this morning addresses the "performance risk" raised in authorities of the court. See, eg. Investa Properties Limited [2007] FCA 1104 at [18] - [19]. Reference is there made to a number of earlier decisions on this question. I am also satisfied that the issue referred to in [27] of Investa , namely, the "vesting free of encumbrances" term is sufficiently addressed. </sentence>

9 In purporting to create a contractual obligation by the former member in favour of a third party --- whether the member voted for or against the scheme or did not vote --- that clause appears to stretch the effect of an arrangement between a company and its members a long way. However, Lindgren J considered such a clause in Re APN News 62 ACSR 400 ; 25 ACLC 784 ; [2007] FCA 770 at [57] ---[63] with approval and took the same course in Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 at [21] . In Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] QSC 207 Fryberg J considered such a clause at [20]---[29]. His Honour was persuaded to change the initial adverse reaction which he had expressed in Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd (2007) 61 ACSR 266 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 163 ; [2007] QSC 37 at [39] . In this field, it is acknowledged that uniformity of decision is important to avoid unnecessary uncertainty. As I cannot be satisfied that the other decisions are clearly wrong, I should follow them. If, on confirmation of the scheme, a party raises the issue so that an argument with a contradictor takes place, it is possible that a different result would occur. Even if that were so, the scheme could be confirmed without the relevant clause (cf Re WebCentral Group Ltd (No 2) (2006) 58 ACSR 742 ; [2006] FCA 1203). </sentence>
