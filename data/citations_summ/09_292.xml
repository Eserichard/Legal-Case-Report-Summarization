 KOURAKIS J :
 
 Introduction 
 In proceedings which were before me late last year, the plaintiff (ITC) and the fourth defendant (Timbercorp) contested the validity and lawfulness of ITC's notice of 30 September 2009 of the exercise of its option to acquire 50,000 shares in the fifth defendant (PPT) registered in the name of Timbercorp (the default option). On 6 November 2009, I delivered written reasons finding for ITC and, on 18 November 2009, I made orders declaring that ITC had validly and lawfully given notice of the exercise of the Default Option pursuant to cl 7.2 of the Shareholders' Deed dated 13 September 2005, as supplemented and amended by a Supplemental Deed dated 18 September 2007. The extent to which the context in which a constitution is made can be considered will, in my view, vary according to the nature and shareholding of the company. [12] I respectfully agree with the observations of Mansfield J in Territory Realty Pty Ltd v Garraway [13] to the effect that the circumstance that a company is a "quasi-partnership" is an important part of the context in which to construe provisions which are calculated to control the internal management of the company. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 739">On 1 April 2009 I published reasons for judgment in this matter: Territory Realty Pty Ltd v Garraway [2009] FCA 292 (the primary judgment). On 6 May 2009 I made orders giving effect to those reasons. The only issue that remains to be dealt with is the costs of the proceeding. That is the subject of these reasons. </sentence>
