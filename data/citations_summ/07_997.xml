<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 481">The Full Court considered the effect of s 80(2) in ICI Australia Operations [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248. At 255 Lockhart J (French J agreeing) said: 
 
 Subsection (2) of s.80 empowers the Court to grant an interim injunction "where in the opinion of the Court it is desirable to do so". In World Series Cricket Pty Limited v Parish [(1977) 16 ALR 181] (one of the first decisions of a Full Court of this Court under the Act) it was stated by Bowen C.J. (at 185) that "These words confer a judicial discretion of the widest kind upon the Court"; though his Honour then said: 
 

 
 
 
 It is not an arbitrary discretion but one to be exercised judicially in accordance with principle. The principles concerning the grant of interlocutory injunctions were developed in the Court of Chancery, but have been moulded to what is appropriate for different jurisdictions in which interlocutory relief may be obtained.
