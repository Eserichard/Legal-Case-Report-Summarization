<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 136">Bell submitted that Ms Meaden's submissions in [14] and [15] above, namely, that to order particulars would be 'contrary to authority' do not withstand even cursory scrutiny. According to Bell: 
(1) They are contrary to FAI (No 1) ;
 
(2) They are contrary to what Jacobson J would have ordered, presumably after full argument, in Peter Hanne &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Village Life Ltd [2008] FCA 719 at [15] and [57];
 
(3) They are contrary to what occurred in Weimann v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 1292 at [24] , although the reasons for that order do not appear to be available. (Each of those proceedings concerned a class of group members defined by having entered into a litigation funding agreement: see Peter Hanne at [3] and Weimann v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 673 at [34] . )
 
Most importantly, according to Bell, none of the authorities cited by Ms Meaden demonstrate that it is in fact contrary to authority to provide particulars of the group members. What the cases cited by Ms Meaden, particularly Thomas v Powercor Australia , demonstrate is that in some cases the passivity of the group members' role might justify limiting the amount of involvement they have. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1292">In written submissions for the hearing on 10 November 2009, supplemented by oral submissions by senior counsel for the applicant, the applicant contends that to a very significant extent the rights to relief claimed in the ACCC proceedings before Justice Foster and this proceeding arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions, being the entry by Allphones' franchisees into the Old Agreement (as to which see outline of causes of actions and pleadings in the proceeding before me in Weimann v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 673).  On 23 June 2009, the Court, amongst other things, granted leave to convert the proceeding into a representative proceeding (see Weimann v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 673). The Court then made further directions as to the conduct of the matter towards trial in the same areas as before and the proceeding was adjourned to a further directions hearing on 2 September 2009.  In general terms, however, the issues raised by the current proceeding before me involve the proper construction of the Old Agreement so far as the right of a franchisee to renew is concerned, as well as separate allegations concerning unconscionable conduct by Allphones towards franchisees. The details once again are set out in Weimann v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 673. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 135">42 On 23 June 2009, the primary judge in Weimann v Allphones Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 673 permitted leave to file and serve an amended application including an application under Pt IVA FCA as well as an amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 849">The applicant (Allphones) seeks leave to appeal orders made by the docket judge on 23 June 2009 in Weimann v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 673. Allphones submits as a primary position that this application for leave and the appeal itself should be referred to a Full Court.  Allphones says there is a distinction between these two claims. Even if it could be argued that the allegation of unconscionable conduct against the Group B members raised a current justiciable controversy, Allphones argues that the contractual claim does not do so. That argument is raised for the reasons indicated above (in [10]) and on the basis of the dictum of Holland J in Dormer v Solo Investments Pty Ltd [1974] 1 NSWLR 428 at 434. That case was considered by his Honour in [105] of Weimann v Allphones [2009] FCA 673. Allphones argues that what steps a member of the Group B franchisees will take such as renewing or otherwise is something in each case that, to use the words of Holland J 'he has not yet taken is not bound to take and may not take'. This appears to be where the debate lies.  The issue which Allphones seeks to ventilate on appeal is the correctness of the Court's decision in Weimann [2009] FCA 673 that amendment to the application and pleadings should be permitted to (in effect), convert the proceeding to a representative proceeding pursuant to Pt IVA FCA. </sentence>
