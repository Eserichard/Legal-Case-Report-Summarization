<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 885">2 The tribunal had affirmed the decision of a delegate of the Minister not to grant the applicant a protection visa in its decision, signed on 21 February 2006 and handed down on 14 March 2006. Among other things, the tribunal found that it did not accept the evidence of the applicant. He sought constitutional writ relief from the Federal Magistrates Court later that year and his application was dismissed by that court: SZFIR v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 1451. An appeal to this Court was dismissed last year: SZFIR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 424. On 7 February this year, Hayne and Crennan JJ refused the applicant's application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia saying that: "None of the arguments advanced, whether in this Court or in the courts below, would enjoy prospects of success sufficient to warrant a grant of special leave": SZFIR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] HCA Trans 63. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 365">The Federal Court in its decision reported as SZFIR v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 424 dismissed all of the grounds of appeal against the decision of this Court and did not give leave for the additional grounds to be argued and determined by that Court. Read as a whole, I regard the decision of the Federal Court as affirming the proposition that the decision of the Tribunal is a privative clause decision. The decision of the Federal Court is of course binding upon me.  [1] The applicant appealed against the judgment of Federal Magistrate Smith by notice of appeal filed in the Federal Court on 9 October 2006. On 27 March 2007 Justice Collier ordered, inter alia, that the appeal be dismissed. [2] The applicant sought special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia against the judgment of Justice Collier by application filed on 23 April 2007. On 7 February 2008 Justices Hayne and Crennan ordered that the application for special leave be dismissed. [3] The present application, filed in this Court on 3 March 2008, seeks judicial review of the same decision of the Tribunal of which review has already been sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 765">16 Only where it is expedient and in the interests of justice to do so will leave be granted to argue a ground of appeal abandoned in a lower court: see O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 at [319] ; Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at [7] . In NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [163] Madgwick J adopted the approach taken by Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ in VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [48] where their Honours said:
 
 'The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below, but which clearly has merit, is advanced, and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated. Where however there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused. ' 

This principle has been followed more recently in SZFIR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 424 and SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886. </sentence>
