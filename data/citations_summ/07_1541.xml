<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 9">On 5 October 2007 Middleton J published his reasons for judgment in VID 210 of 2007; XAT KY v Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1541. Middleton J: 
(a) dismissed the application for the review of the decision of Deputy Registrar Mussett on 23 May 2007 winding up APM;
 
 
(b) removed the stay order in respect of the winding up order;
(c) wound up APM in insolvency; and
(d) appointed Mr Michael Wesley McCann liquidator of APM. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 74">The applicants have not pointed to any privileged document which has actually been read by any of the second to sixth respondents. It follows that the Court is unable to identify any detriment which has been occasioned to the applicants in the conduct of their defence to the Portsea litigation. In my view, a similar approach should be taken to an application to prevent a trustee in bankruptcy, or a trustee's staff, from continuing to prosecute a particular legal action as courts have traditionally taken in deciding whether to restrain a legal practitioner from acting in litigation where that legal practitioner has obtained an advantage which could operate unfairly on another party to the litigation. The relevant authorities include GT Corporation Pty Ltd v Amare Safety Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 123 , H. Starke &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Von Stanke, O'Meara [2006] SASC 308 ; (2006) 95 SASR 425 , Xat Ky v Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1541 and Geelong School Supplies Ltd v Dean [2006] FCA 1404 ; (2006) 237 ALR 612. Those authorities indicate that the discretion to grant an injunction is to be exercised sparingly and where, as it would be perceived by a fair-minded reasonable observer, the risk to the proper administration of justice would outweigh the denial to the opposing litigant of his or her choice of legal representative and the cost and inconvenience of being compelled to change counsel or solicitors. See also Bureau Interprofessional Des Vins De Bourgogne v Red Earth Nominees Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 588 , where I reviewed some of the cognate authorities on an application to restrain a firm of solicitors from continuing to act in proceedings because a solicitor employed by that firm had obtained information confidential to another party in the litigation as a result of having, whilst a partner in another firm, advised that party. I there assessed, at [60], whether there was a real risk of relevant confidential information coming into the hands of the firm by which the solicitor was then employed. In the light of that assessment, the injunction was refused. </sentence>
