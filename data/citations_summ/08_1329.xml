<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 536">It therefore comes as no surprise to discover that the decisions of this Court, necessarily by judges at first instance, have suggested that clear cut cases for the grant, or refusal of leave to appeal will obviously be more readily, and speedily, dealt with by a single judge than by requiring the attention of a Full Court: Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 at [8] ( Optiver ), Buchanan J; but that where the case for the grant or refusal of leave is more evenly balanced, considerations of a different kind are raised: Optiver at [9]; and that it may not be necessary to express any firm view about the strength of contentions advanced by an applicant where a case is evenly balanced: Optiver at [18]; or that a direction that the application be determined by a Full Court should not be made in a case which can be characterised as a minor interlocutory squabble over discovery or the like: TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1329 ( TS Production ) at [7] per Heerey J; but that that there may be cases where the presence or absence of either substantial injustice or sufficient doubt is so clear and obvious that the application should be disposed of on that ground alone: TS Production at [11]; or that the case is one, identifiable through experience, where it is not really practicable to separate out the leave issue of whether the decision below is attended with sufficient doubt from the substantive merits: TS Production at [13]; or that the application to appeal is "hopeless": Allphones Retail Pty Ltd ACN 008 168 090 v Weimann [ 2009] FCA 849 ( Allphones ) at [13], McKerracher J; and where the decision has serious implications for the parties or one of them if the decision to be appealed against is allowed to stand: Allphones at [22]; or where the application for leave to appeal is not straight forward, suggesting that on efficiency and cost consideration grounds the direction to the Full Court should be made: Edwards v Santos Limited [2010] FCA 34 at [10] , per Collier J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 34">A number of these factors emerge from cases including Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 , TS Production LLC [2008] FCA 1329 , Zegarac v Pitcher Partners [2009] FCA 1061 , Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 849 and Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1516 ; (2008) 172 FCR 469. Consideration
  Issues relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion include the following: Factors of efficiency. As a general rule applications for leave to appeal which are relatively straightforward will be more efficiently dealt with by a single Judge than by a Full Court. Whether orders the subject of the application for leave to appeal could properly be characterised as a "minor interlocutory squabble" ( TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1329 at [7] ), or whether important and final consequences for the parties followed from the orders (irrespective whether substantive rights were determined). Whether the applicant's claims raise issues of novel and general importance which should be the subject of consideration by a Full Court. Whether, prima facie , it can properly be said that there are arguments of substance supporting the contention that the primary judgment is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration by the Full Court, or substantial injustice, on the basis that a hopeless application should not be referred to the Full Court ( Allphones Retail Pty Ltd v Weimann [2009] FCA 849 at [13] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 849">The current application seems to me to be a case more in line with TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1329 where Heerey J referred to the Full Court the application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of Sundberg J allowing a stay of proceedings. His Honour observed (at [7]): 
 Order 52 r 2AA requires some ground to be shown why an application for leave to appeal should be determined by the Full Court. In my opinion such ground has been shown in the present case. This case cannot be characterised as a minor interlocutory squabble over discovery or the like. His Honour's orders result in important consequences for the parties, even though, as Mr Rebikoff for the respondents pointed out, they do not determine substantive rights. 
  The factors on which I have touched are all driven simply to answering the question of whether the application for leave should be heard by a Full Court. I have not sought to answer in detail the question as to whether the judgment is attended by doubt sufficient or otherwise for the reason that it is not really practicable to separate out the sufficient doubt issue from the substantive merits. As in TS Production LLC [2008] FCA 1329 and as in Optiver [2008] FCA 47 , the more efficient and appropriate course, is to refer the application for leave to appeal to be heard by a Full Court of this Court. It is not for me to order that the appeal be heard by the Full Court but as in TS Production LLC , I will make an order that subject to any contrary direction of the Full Court, that course be pursued. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1516">5 Counsel for Mr Harding advanced a number of reasons why the application for leave should be referred to a Full Court. He did so by reference to matters considered by Heerey J in TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1329. The first was whether the case could be characterised as a minor interlocutory squabble or one where orders had been made with important consequences for the parties. The second was whether the applicant seeking leave would suffer prejudice or an injustice if leave was refused. The third was whether something of value would be lost if the interlocutory judgment stood. The fourth was whether the interlocutory judgment dealt with substantial legal issues. For reasons that I will endeavour to explain shortly, I do not think that any of these matters point, in Mr Harding's favour, to referring the matter to a Full Court. </sentence>
