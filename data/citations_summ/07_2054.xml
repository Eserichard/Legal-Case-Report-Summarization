They all submitted that the content of the norms of conduct conveyed by the expression "improperly use" was no different from the kind of impropriety which equity would require to restrain a breach of confidence or of fiduciary duty. The parties relied upon the recent Full Court judgment in Futuretronics.com.au Pty Ltd v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 2 ; (2009) 81 IPR 1 , 9-10, [44]-[46]. I accept the parties' agreement in this respect: indeed, I am bound to apply the law as contained in Futuretronics . I note, however, that the Full Court does not appear to have been referred to Grove v Flavel (1986) 43 SASR 410 , 416-417 or to R v Byrnes [1995] HCA 1 ; (1995) 183 CLR 501 , 514 (which I had cause to discuss in Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2054 ; (2007) 165 FCR 92 , 128-130, [100]-[105]). </sentence>
