<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 357">In Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No.3) [2006] FCA 745 Young J considered the application of those provisions in the context of an application for costs including costs of interlocutory proceedings. In doing so His Honour reviewed the background to section 824(2) of the WR Act and said: "5. Subsection (1) of s 824 was based upon an earlier provision in s 347(1) of the WRA: see the Explanatory Memorandum to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1028">It was contended (and not disputed by the applicants) that s.17 applied to interlocutory matters such as the application in a case (see Shackley v Australian Croatian Club Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 736 at 744; Commonwealth of Australia v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2003] FCAFC 115 ; (2003) 129 FCR 271 at 274; [2003] FCAFC 115 and Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure and Another (No 3) (2006) 152 FCR 534 ; [2006] FCA 745 at [10] --- [16]). As Young J noted in Paras at [16] in relation to the s.824(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (which is in similar terms to s.17(2)) , that subsection: : ... is not confined to costs associated with the institution of the proceedings or a step in the proceedings; it extends more broadly to costs incurred as a result of any unreasonable act or omission. On a plain and natural meaning of s 824(2) , there is no reason why the reference to an unreasonable act or omission that has caused another party to incur costs in connection with the proceeding should not extend to unreasonable acts or omissions in connection with an interlocutory application. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 50">74 In my respectful opinion, that conclusion is inconsistent with the judgment of Young J in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534 ( Paras ) and with the judgment of the Full Court (Black CJ, Tamberlin and Sundberg JJ) in Commonwealth v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2003] FCAFC 115 ; (2003) 129 FCR 271 (the 2003 Commonwealth v CFMEU judgment).  77 The joint judgment notes, in [151]:
 
 
 151 ... The authorities were reviewed by Young J in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534. His Honour's review demonstrates that the weight of authority favours the proposition that an interlocutory application, made by a party to a proceeding under the Act, is a proceeding in a matter for the purposes of s 824(1): see, particularly, Shackley v Australian Croatian Club Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 736 ; Commonwealth v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2003] FCAFC 115 ; (2003) 129 FCR 271. See also Sydney Ferries Corporation v Australian Maritime Officers Union (No 3) [2008] FCA 960 at [6] .  151 There are conflicting decisions in this Court and in the Industrial Relations Court as to whether an interlocutory application constitutes a "proceeding in a matter" within the meaning of s 824(1) and its predecessor. The authorities were reviewed by Young J in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534. His Honour's review demonstrates that the weight of authority favours the proposition that an interlocutory application, made by a party to a proceeding under the Act , is a proceeding in a matter for the purposes of s 824(1): see, particularly, Shackley v Australian Croatian Club Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 736 ; Commonwealth v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2003] FCAFC 115 ; (2003) 129 FCR 271. See also Sydney Ferries Corporation v Australian Maritime Officers Union (No 3) [2008] FCA 960 at [6] . None of these cases, however, involved an interlocutory application by a person who was not a party to the proceeding at the time at which the application was made. They do not, therefore, provide direct assistance in resolving the present issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 339">In Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 879 ; (2007) 162 FCR 392 at [28] Tracey J made it clear that a party may potentially be liable to pay costs under s 824(2) even if it did not institute the proceeding in which the relevant conduct occurred. The power conferred by s 824(2) can be exercised irrespective of the outcome of the particular application in question, and of the proceeding in its entirety: Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534 at [16] per Young J. Justice Tracey observed that the prosecution of a hopeless case can be regarded as an "unreasonable act" for the purposes of s 824(2): Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd (No 3) at [36]. Accordingly, I proceed on the basis that s 824(2) allows costs to be awarded where an applicant has quite unreasonably joined certain respondents to a proceeding in circumstances where the proceeding itself was not instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 224">The AWU agreed that s 824 governed the issue of costs. However, the AWU submitted that s 824(1) was not engaged as the motion was not futile or unworthy of consideration. As to s 824(2) (on which the applicant relied), the applicant's submissions were inconsistent with Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (No 2) (2007) 166 IR 23 ; [2007] FCAFC 145 at [13] to [17]. The Full Court of the Federal Court, in that matter, confirmed that: - (i) a proceeding is not commenced unreasonably merely because the argument is unsuccessful, (ii) there is a distinction between an unsuccessful argument and one "so misconceived that it can be characterised as unreasonable or vexatious" (citing Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) (2006) 152 FCR 534; [2006] FCA 745 at [22]), and (iii) the general rule in industrial matters is "that parties will usually be freed from the traditional risk of an order for costs following the event" (citing Hatchett v Bowater Tutt Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) [1991] FCA 188 ; (1991) 28 FCR 324 at 326). The applicant's letter did not deal with the AWU's arguments on the motion, including the contemporaneous evidence and the failure of both parties to draw that evidence to the Court's attention. The motion was not "incompetent or unsupportable" ( Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Clarke (2008) 170 FCR 574 ; [2008] FCAFC 143 at [29] ). </sentence>

6 As AMOU's submissions point out, the expression ' proceeding in a matter ' in s 824(1) extends to an application made by motion in the course of the principal action: Shackley v Australian Croatian Club Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 736 , at 744 (IRC), per Wilcox CJ (with whom von Doussa J agreed); Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534 , at 539 [19]. There is no dispute that s 824(1) applies to an application for interlocutory relief, just as it does to a motion seeking interlocutory orders. Section 824(1) therefore applies both to the costs of SFC's application for interlocutory relief and of the successful motion brought by AMOU and the second respondents for an anti-suit injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 875">In Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No.3) [2006] FCA 745 Young J considered the application of these provisions in the context of an application for costs including costs of interlocutory proceedings. In doing so His Honour reviewed the background to section 824(2) of the WR Act and said: "5. Subsection (1) of s 824 was based upon an earlier provision in s 347(1) of the WRA: see the Explanatory Memorandum to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 659">27 The power to order costs under s 85A(2) is expressed in similar, but not identical terms, in the provisions of s 824(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) which were considered by Young J in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534. He gave that section a wide construction on its plain and natural meaning: Paras 152 FCR at 538 [16]. But Young J held that the applicant for the order had to satisfy the Court that, relevantly, the other party's conduct 'involved unreasonable acts or omissions that caused the [party applying for the order] to incur costs': Paras 152 FCR at 539 [19].

14 In my opinion, the application for costs, in the present circumstances, may be grounded under either s 824(1) or s 824(2): Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534 at [16] and [19]. Accordingly, costs may be ordered if the motion for injunctive relief was instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause, or that the pursuit of that motion by the LHMU involved unreasonable acts or omissions which caused the respondent to incur costs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 336">In relation to its contentions about section 824(2) of the WR Act the applicant relied on the decisions in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No.3) [2006] FCA 745 and Ansari v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited [2007] FCA 1908 (" Ansari "). Respondent's submissions
  In Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No.3) [2006] FCA 745 Young J considered the application of these provisions in the context of an application for costs including costs of interlocutory proceedings. In doing so His Honour reviewed the background to section 824(2) of the WR Act and said: "5. Subsection (1) of s 824 was based upon an earlier provision in s 347(1) of the WRA: see the Explanatory Memorandum to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FCAFC 145">16 Young J made a similar observation in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745 at [22] where his Honour said:
 
 There is, however, a distinction between an application that proves unsuccessful and an application or argument that is so misconceived that it can be characterised as unreasonable or vexatious. An order for costs might be made under s 824 in the latter case but not the former. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FCA 879">12 The applicant was correct to accept that s 347(1) applied to subsidiary applications made in the course of a proceeding. Although there are conflicting authorities, (as to which see the cases collected in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No. 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534 at 536-539), the conflict was resolved by the decision of the Full Court in Commonwealth of Australia v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2003] FCAFC 115 ; (2003) 129 FCR 271. In that case the Full Court (Black CJ, Tamberlin and Sundberg JJ) followed the decision of Wilcox CJ (with whom von Doussa J agreed) in the Industrial Relations Court in Shackley v Australian Croatian Club Limited (1996) 141 ALR 736. In Shackley Wilcox CJ said (at 745) that:
 
 "As I have indicated, the word "proceeding" is widely used to refer, not only to a principal action (or "proceeding") between parties, but also to any subsidiary application made during the course of the principal action. There is no reason to believe that the word is used in a different sense in s 347; indeed the word in parenthesis indicates the contrary. If parliament had intended that "proceeding" should be understood, in s 347, as meaning only a principal action that commenced when the Court's jurisdiction was first invoked and concluded with final judgment, it would have been absurd to say that an appeal alone might constitute a "proceeding"". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCAFC 53">18 In the second respondent's submissions on the question of costs reliance was placed upon the decision of Young J in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745. That case concerned an application for costs in relation to a Notice of Motion dated 25 May 2006 by which the respondent sought orders discharging or staying an interlocutory injunction which his Honour had granted on 19 May 2006. All relevant matters in that case occurred after 27 March 2006.</sentence>
