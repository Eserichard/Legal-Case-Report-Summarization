<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 763">The power to make an order tansferring a proceeding to the Federal Magistrates Court is a discretionary power (s 32AB(1)) which may be exercised upon the Court's own initiative (s 32AB(2)(b)). It is thus a power which may be exercised even though an applicant may oppose such an order being made: e.g. Rahman v Dayeh [2006] FCA 1362. But where the parties consent to the making of such an order, Jacobson J has observed that such consent is " decisive ": Rixon v Business Parcel Express Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 969 at [3] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 98">On the latter occasion his Honour ordered that the matter be transferred to this Court (see Rahman v Dayeh [2006] FCA 1362).</sentence>
