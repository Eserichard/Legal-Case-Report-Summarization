<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] QSC 309">[3] 
 [12] In Secretary to the Department of Justice v Osland [2007] VSCA 96 at [29] - [42], however, the Victorian Court of Appeal criticised the application of those statements by his Honour as if they constituted rules of general application.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] VSCA 96">If fairness has a role to play it seems to me that the relevant unfairness arises from the inconsistency. It is unfair in this sense to permit Multiemedia to cast aside confidentiality of the advice in making the statement to the world at large so as to explain or justify its position and to then insist upon confidentiality when inspection is sought of an otherwise discoverable document. " [54] 
 
 
 40 In 2006, Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [55] applied what he described as "the principle stated in Bennett" , citing the statement by Gyles J that the disclosure of the conclusion of legal advice amounted to waiver in respect of the whole advice. 41 Reference should also be made to the following statement by Young J in AWB Limited v Cole (No 5) , [56] a judgment handed down after the conclusion of argument in this appeal. After a review of the authorities, his Honour said: 
 
 
 "AWB submitted that the reasoning in Bennett was unsound, particularly the holding that the disclosure of the conclusion stated in legal advice will amount to a waiver of the whole of the advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] NSWLEC 141">15 Unless there is waiver the Council is entitled to claim privilege over the legal advice. The fact these are Class 1 proceedings does not suggest any different approach to the issue of waiver should be adopted. The issue as identified in Mann v Carnell is whether there is inconsistency between the maintenance of the confidentiality and the Council's conduct. The Applicant argued there had been a waiver of privilege because the Council's letter seeking advice was discovered and the letter of 7 November 2006 discloses the substance of the advice, relying on Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 12 ) [2006] FCA 348 and Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101. In Bennett at [62] Gyles J considered that the primary judge was in error where he: 
 drew a distinction between the conclusion expressed in legal advice on the one hand and the reasons for that conclusion on the other, and took the view that disclosure of the conclusion does not involve disclosure of the reasons". At [65] his Honour held that "the voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice amounts to waiver in respect of the whole of the advice. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 1234">The substance or content of the advice is not disclosed with specificity or clarity. Questions of waiver are matters of fact and degree and, in this instance, I am not persuaded that the conduct, assertions or admissible evidence are sufficient to warrant the necessary implication that legal professional privilege has been waived. ' 
 
 
 The principles discussed in Bennett were applied in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 12 ) [2006] FCA 348. The issue was whether a statement in a discovered document that '[o]ur legal advice is that the risk of damages being awarded against Optus is low' had the consequence of waiving privilege in the legal advice that it referred to. Sackville J held that it did; the statement voluntarily disclosed the gist or conclusion of the legal advice: at [12].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 1999">The principles discussed in Bennett were applied in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 12 ) [2006] FCA 348.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] FCA 571">138 Bennett has been followed by Sundberg J in Rio Tinto Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1336 ; (2005) 224 ALR 299 at 312-313 [49] - [53] , and Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 12) [2006] FCA 348: see also Switchcorp Pty Ltd v Multiemedia Ltd [2005] VSC 425. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] FCA 707">1 This is an application by the applicants in the substantive proceedings which are currently part heard before Sackville J for access to the parts of a letter dated 18 February 2002 from Baker &amp; McKenzie to the sixteenth respondent, Optus Vision Pty Limited, which has been produced in redacted form as answering the legal advice the subject of the waiver found by his Honour ( Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 12) [2006] FCA 348 at [20] ). The sixteenth respondent is Optus Vision Pty Limited ('Optus') and the twenty second respondent is Singtel Optus Pty Limited ('Singtel').</sentence>
