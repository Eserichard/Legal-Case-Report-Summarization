<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 822">The exercise of this discretion has been considered in a number of cases (albeit usually in the context of s.426A of the Migration Act , which is the equivalent provision in relation to the Refugee Review Tribunal). No such authorities were referred to in the proceedings before me. There is nothing in the circumstances of this case to establish that the Tribunal's discretion to make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it miscarried in a manner constituting jurisdictional error (see generally the principles in SZJQP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1613 in relation to the exercise of the discretion under s.426A of the Act). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 61">The review applicant relied upon the decision of the Full Court in SZJQP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1613 ; (2007) 98 ALD 575 as being a broad support for her contentions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1201">Mr Truong submitted (Court transcript page 22 line 44) that the Tribunal had regard to dealings it had had with other applicants who had undergone traumatic experiences such as torture. Such prior experience can be of some relevance SZJQP v MIC [2007] FCA 1613 at [51] . The Tribunal does not state that it relied on those dealings in reaching its decision --- it reached its decision having found that the applicant's claims are not genuine as the evidence is inconsistent with them, and that the applicant engaged in delaying tactics. </sentence>
