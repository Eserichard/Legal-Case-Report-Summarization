<citphrase id="cp39.16" type=cited from="[1982] FCA 210">income tax assessment act 1936 (cth), s. 25. following the judgment on 23 april 1983 of a single judge of the federal court of australia (the court), the trade practices commission had recovered from the appellant company simpson ltd (formerly known as simpson pope ltd) (the appellant) a pecuniary penalty under ss. 76 and 77 of the trade practices act 1974 (cth) (the act) by reason of contraventions by the appellant of the provisions of s. 48 of the act relating to the practice of resale price maintenance. pursuant to s. 82 of the act, the respondent company hubbards pty ltd recovered damages of $52,373 being the sums of $49,477 plus $13,330, totalling $62,807, less a discount in respect of income tax of $10,434.  the appellant appealed and the respondent cross-appealed to the full court against the assessment of damages which had been calculated having regard to the "lost sales" of simpson products over a specified period. in calculating the net profit on sales the learned trial judge had made a deduction to allow for an expected increase in bankcard charges and a reduction attributable to notional sales other than simpson products referable to the bankcard component in sales by the respondent. the appellant contended that the overall award was excessive and submitted, inter alia, that the learned trial judge had erred in calculating the net profit on sales; that a reduction attributable to notional sales of other than simpson products referable to the bankcard component had not been allowed; that, while the learned trial judge had correctly made some allowance for income tax in respect of the damages awarded, a full allowance of forty-six per cent should have been allowed, rather than taking into account tax losses; and that the overall award was excessive.  the respondent submitted that the incidence of tax should have been ignored in the award of damages contending that, if the amount was assessable, this could have been determined elsewhere and having regard to the state of profit or losses which existed at the relevant time of receipt.  held: (1) the learned trial judge was justified, on the evidence before him, in treating the damages to be awarded for loss of profit in the calendar year 1979 as probably assessable income within the meaning of s. 25 of the income tax assessment act 1936 (cth). the commissioner of taxation was not a party and, in view of the concession made by the appellant the full court was not required to finally determine the question of liability of tax.  stoke-on-trent city council v. wood mitchell &amp; co. ltd (1980) 1 wlr 254 , referred to.  (2) the basic principle which was applicable was that damages were compensatory. if the damages were taxable in this case it followed that, if forty-six per cent were deducted from the calculation and the balance only awarded as damages, this balance would be taxable in the hands of the respondent at forty-six per cent. in other words, the respondent would in effect, if the damages were taxable, be taxed at twice the rate of forty-six per cent and the commissioner of taxation would be deprived of part of the tax he might have received, the benefit of this being passed to the appellant. in addition, it would have meant that the respondent would not have been properly compensated for its loss.</citphrase>

The basis in principle for including post-loss data can only be that those events would have occurred in any event.

It is, however, properly characterised as an interpretation provision and " does not of itself create a cause of action, nor define a norm of conduct ": Ting v Blanche [1993] FCA 524 ; (1993) 118 ALR 543 at 552. Notwithstanding some divergence of views as to the manner of operation of s 51A(2) (see: Readymix Holdings International Pte Ltd v Wieland Process Equipment Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1480 at [91] to [99]), it is considered that s 51A is to be interpreted and applied in the manner explained by Emmett and Allsop JJ in McGrath v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 2 , 165 FCR 230.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] VSC 389">69 In relation to the use of the word "guarantee" in the 4 March 1998 letter, the defendant submitted that the statements of Rares J in Ackers v Austcorp International Ltd [43] were of relevance. As to this, Rares J said: [44] 
 
 
 "I am satisfied that the brochure achieved, objectively and in the subjective minds of each of the applicants who gave evidence before me, the purpose of instilling in them the belief that the rent would be paid as a 'sure thing'.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1429">Nor need attention presently be given to whether it is possible to unilaterally assign the " obligations " or burden of an agreement in a manner which binds the other contracting party without its consent: Carter J, Peden E and Tolhurst G, Contract Law in Australia (5 th ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, 2007) at [17-37]. At least one further difficulty in relation to the contract claim is:
 
(iii) a manner of pleading whereby the draftsman seeks to set forth the manner in which the First, Third and Fourth Respondents " failed to act reasonably and in good faith " by way of " Particulars " rather than by way of a statement of " material facts " as required by O 11 r 2. Sections 51A and 52 
 Section 51A, it has been recognised, " is a qualified and complex deeming provision ": Ackers v Austcorp International Ltd [2009] FCA 432 at [354] per Rares J. It is, however, properly characterised as an interpretation provision and does not of itself create a cause of action: Ting v Blanche [1993] FCA 524 ; (1993) 118 ALR 543 at 552. Section 51A provides as follows: 
 
 Interpretation 
 

 
 
 (1) For the purposes of this Division, where a corporation makes a representation with respect to any future matter (including the doing of, or the refusing to do, any act) and the corporation does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation, the representation shall be taken to be misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1112">The matter has been before me on a number of occasions in connection with the appellant's attempts to overturn the decision of Rares J given on 1 May 2009 ( Ackers v Austcorp International Ltd [2009] FCA 432) which found reflection in orders made by his Honour on 8 May 2009. The nature and timing of the applications before me provide some of the context for my consideration of the present application. I shall briefly refer to some matters of history later in these Reasons. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 774">On 1 May 2009, his Honour delivered Reasons for Judgment ( Ackers v Austcorp International Ltd [2009] FCA 432) but did not make any orders giving effect to those reasons on that day. Thus, in form, Austcorp seeks leave to appeal from reasons, not orders. Ordinarily, this is a course of action which the Court will not permit (see Baxter Healthcare Pty Limited v Comptroller-General of Customs [1997] FCA 131 ; (1997) 72 FCR 467 at 483 and the cases cited by Burchett J at 483; and see also Secretary, Department of Social Security v Lowe [1999] FCA 705 ; (1999) 92 FCR 26 at [16] (pp 33---34)). However, in the present case, it is not necessary for me to decide whether leave to appeal from his Honour's reasons should be granted. This is because, subsequent to 1 May 2009, his Honour made various orders on three separate occasions consequent upon the delivery of his reasons on 1 May 2009. During the course of argument before me, Austcorp made clear that it wished to challenge all of the substantive orders made by his Honour after 1 May 2009 by whatever means were considered by the Court to be appropriate. Subject to one matter to which I shall refer shortly, Counsel for the respondents to the present application did not oppose leave to appeal being granted to Austcorp nor did she oppose the making of other appropriate orders to regularise Austcorp's appeal. </sentence>
