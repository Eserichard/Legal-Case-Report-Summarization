<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1415">Further, all goods and services within the specification in the application must be considered as the "question is not limited to whether a particular use will give rise to deception or confusion. It must be based upon what the applicant can do if registration is obtained" ( Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd (1999) 93 FCR 365 ; [1999] FCA 1020 at [50] ). Putting it another way "a normal and fair use for all goods covered by the marks under consideration" is required ( Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmetique v Senator Automation Pty Ltd (2007) AIPC 92-256 ; [2007] FCA 1391 at [6] ). (4) To establish deceptive similarity a mere possibility is insufficient. It is "necessary to show a real tangible danger of deception or confusion occurring".</sentence>
