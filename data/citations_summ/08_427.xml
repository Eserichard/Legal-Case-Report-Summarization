<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 157">But first, having got to a point where the petition has been adjourned to a date after its nominal expiry date, it is as well to define the law which permits this Court to make an order nunc pro tunc granting the extension as from date of the order upon which it should have been made, in this case 12 November 2010. In DCT v Sedrak (supra) Barnes FM, in her usual meticulous manner, explains that orders of this type are available in the Federal Court through use of O 35 rule 7(3) of the Federal Court Rules which provides that: "A clerical mistake in a judgment or order, or an error arising in a judgment or order from an accidental slip or omission, may at any time be corrected by the Court. " 
In Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 Lindgren J on appeal from a Federal Magistrate stated at [38]:
 
 "I agree with counsel that if O 35 rule 7(3) was not available to Driver FM there would, in any event, have been available to him an implied power to the same effect. In my view, however, O 35 rule 7(3) was available to his Honour. " 

That decision came after the Full Bench decision in Griffiths v Boral Resources (QLD) Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 149 ; (2006) 154 FCR 554 where their Honours assumed for the purposes of the proceedings that the Federal Magistrates Court was entitled to invoke O 35 rule 7 (at [15]) but did not opine to that effect because it was not necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 377">" [74] 
 
 
66. [73] 
 
 " Ordinarily, the law takes no account of parts of a day, and the expression 'commencing on' must mean commencing on either the first or the last moment of the day in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 601">

 
 As also noted by their Honours, the question as to whether there was any " error " which attracted the power to invoke the " slip rule " is a question of fact: [2006] FCAFC 149 at [68] . With respect, the same reservation is also expressed as to ability to correct an " error " pursuant to O 35 r 7 by extending the duration of a petition in the face of the express statutory terms of s 52(5). Notwithstanding that reservation, it is the case that other authorities have endorsed the existence of a power to extend time after the initial 12 month period has expired and where there has been an accidental slip or omission in failing to make an application within the time prescribed by s 52(5): Matthews v Collett [2000] FCA 224 ; Bankstown Grammar School Ltd v Park [2000] FCA 1205 ; Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 , 246 ALR 175 ; Boumelhem v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA [2008] FCA 1568 ; 1568 , 171 FCR 462.  As to the first limb, it is to be noted that s 52(4) and (5) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) provide as follows: 
 (4) A creditor's petition lapses at the expiration of: 

(a) subject to paragraph (b), the period of 12 months commencing on the date of presentation of the petition; or 
 
(b) if the Court makes an order under subsection (5) in relation to the petition --- the period fixed by the order; 
 
unless, before the expiration of whichever of those periods is applicable, a sequestration order is made on the petition or the petition is dismissed or withdrawn. 
 (5) The Court may, at any time before the expiration of the period of 12 months commencing on the date of presentation of a creditor's petition, if it considers it just and equitable to do so, upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, order that the period at the expiration of which the petition will lapse be such period, being a period exceeding 12 months and not exceeding 24 months, commencing on the date of presentation of the petition as is specified in the order. 

 
Order 35 r 7(3) of the Federal Court Rules provides as follows:
 
 A clerical mistake in a judgment or order, or an error arising in a judgment order from an accidental slip or omission, may at any time be corrected by the Court. 

 
 Rule 1.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth), it may be noted, provides that the Federal Magistrates Court may apply the Federal Court Rules where, in a particular case, the 2001 Rules are " insufficient or inappropriate ". By reason of the terms of Rule 1.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules , no question arises as to a Federal Magistrate not being clothed with authority to invoke O 35 r 7: Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 at [37] to [41] [2008] FCA 427 ; , 246 ALR 175 at 181 to 182 per Lindgren J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 521">In Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 ; (2008) 246 ALR 175 Lindgren J considered a version of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules in which the list in Schedule 3 to the Rules of particular Federal Court Rules that were applied to proceedings in this Court pursuant to r.1.05(3), included O.35 r.7 of the Federal Court Rules . Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the Federal Magistrates Court Rules no longer includes the reference to r.7 of O.35 so that is it no longer open to find that the provisions of O.35 r.7(3) are applicable in this Court by virtue of r.1.05(3) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 411">In addition, r.1.05(3)(b) is to the effect that, without limiting subrule 2, the provisions of the Federal Court Rules set out in Part 2 of Schedule 3 apply, with necessary changes, to general federal law proceedings. Part 2 of Schedule 3 lists specific Federal Court Rules . In Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 ; (2008) 246 ALR 175 Lindgren J (at [41]) found that the power conferred by Order 35 r.7(3) of the Federal Court Rules was available to this Court under r.1.05(3)(b). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1568">36 In the recent decision of Lindgren J in Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 ; (2008) 246 ALR 175 his Honour held at [38] that Order 35 rule 7(3) of the Federal Court Rules was available to Driver FM who was then considering an application for the extension of the life of a creditor's petition after it had expired, there having been an accidental slip or omission in orders previously made by the learned Federal Magistrate in that case. Lindgren J said at [38]:
 
 
 '38 I agree with counsel that if O 35 r 7(3) was not available to Driver FM, there would, in any event, have been available to him an implied power to the same effect. In my view, however, O 35 r 7(3) was available to his Honour. ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 1275">Mr and Mrs Vok's third point relies upon the incorrect reference in Registrar Tesoriero's substituted service order in relation to the bankruptcy notice addressed to Mr Vok, which I have referred to above, i.e. that it mis-described the number of that notice. Mr Madden's counsel submits that this was an error in the Registrar's order which can be cured nunc pro tunc pursuant to the Federal Court's power under O.35 r.7(3) of the Federal Court Rules or an equivalent implied power, which is available to this Court when exercising its bankruptcy jurisdiction (see Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 at [38] and [40]). That rule provides: A clerical mistake in a judgment or order, or an error arising in a judgment or order from an accidental slip or omission, may at any time be corrected by the Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 555">Their opinion was incorrect, as is now appreciated by the petitioner in the light of a judgment given by Lindgren J in Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 on 2 April 2008. As his Honour points out, the 12 month period under which a petition expires unless that time is extended under s.52(5) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), is to be counted by including the date on which the petition is lodged. In the present case the 12 month period in fact was due to expire at midnight on 25 February 2008. </sentence>
