There is no evidence of what enquiries, if any, were made by the applicants' tax agent; and (i) at the time of preparation of the applicants' tax returns there were no authorities specifically dealing with deductions for participation in retirement village arrangements of the kind the applicants entered. The first such decision was that of Allsop J in Malouf v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 497 ; (2008) 250 ALR 253 in relation to a retirement village arrangement in all material respects identical to that the applicants entered. His honour's finding in Malouf must mean that any taxpayer who entered a similar arrangement and who claimed deductions on the basis that Mr Malouf claimed his deductions must have had an argument in relation to their position that was as likely as not to be correct in the sense of that phrase as observed by Hill J in Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1428 and Cooper J in Prebble v Commissioner of Taxation 2002 ATC 5045. 
  The facts to be found are as follows: (a) each of the applicants invested $100,000 in the retirement village scheme promoted by Prime Life Corporation Limited, or one of its subsidiaries, which entailed a proposed development of a retirement village in Springvale in Victoria, to be known as the Windsor Gardens retirement village. The manner in which the applicants invested was through participation in a partnership (the Windsor Gardens Partnership) made up of a number of syndicates or partnerships, one of which included the applicants as members; (b) the facts concerning the retirement village scheme and its features are materially no different from those extant in the case of Malouf v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 497 ; (2008) 250 ALR 253 and [2009] FCAFC 44 ; (2009) 174 FCR 581. The applicant invested in a retirement village development scheme promoted by Prime Life limited which entailed a deposit and commitments to pay further amounts upon a range of conditions being satisfied which, in 1999, 2000 and 2001 were not satisfied; (c) the applicants are a married couple of Korean origin who speak limited English and who are retired; (d) Mr Shin had the dealings with the advisors to both of the applicants and Mrs Shin relied on her husband; (e) Mr Shin displayed minimal understanding of the retirement village investment and of the current proceedings. In 1999 he was looking to make an investment that would provide for his retirement and consulted his tax agent.</sentence>
