<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 293">As the first respondent submitted, in considering whether the applicant, as a citizen of Nepal, had a legally enforceable right to enter and reside in India, the Tribunal had regard not only to the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between India and Nepal but also to independent country information concerning the implementation of the Treaty. (See generally, SZGXK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1891 and, in particular, the discussion of the judges of the Full Court of Federal Court in SZMWQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2010) 187 FCR 109 ; [2010] FCAFC 97). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 132">The Tribunal considered both the relevant Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the two nations, and other relevant independent country information from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs. No error is revealed in this regard (see SZGXK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1891 , especially at [33] per Graham J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] RRTA 855">Furthermore, and in the alternative, even if I were to accept that there was a real chance that the applicant would be persecuted if he returned to Nepal - which for the reasons given above I do not - I would find that, as I put to the applicant, as a Nepalese citizen, he has the right to enter and reside in India. In their submission to the Tribunal the applicant's representatives referred to decisions of the Tribunal (differently constituted) with regard to whether Nepalese nationals have a legally enforceable right to enter and reside in India and at the hearing before me the applicant's representative submitted that there were divergent views taken by different members of the Tribunal in relation to this issue. As I indicated to the applicant's representative, however, I consider that the issue whether Nepalese nationals have a right to enter and reside in India for the purposes of subsection 36(3) of the Act has been resolved by the decision of the Federal Court in SZGXK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1891.  I noted that Flick J (with whom Besanko J agreed) had said in SZMWQ at [109] that the right to enter and reside did not necessarily incorporate even an ability to obtain employment. The applicant's representative suggested that this would be an interesting question for the High Court to look at. He said that he did not understand why the Randhawa approach did not apply when you were looking at a third country. He said that in the past there had been cases in relation to Nepalese women where the Tribunal had looked at whether the applicants could survive in India. I noted that I thought that the divergence of views with regard to whether Nepalese nationals had a right to enter and reside in India had been resolved by the decision of the Federal Court in SZGXK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1891 in which the Federal Court had said that the material which the Tribunal had was sufficient to establish that there was a right to enter and reside in India. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 613">The Minister has not sought to uphold the Tribunal's decision on the basis that it made findings of fact which could be sufficient if the Tribunal had addressed issues under ss.36(3) , (4) and (5) (compare my earlier decisions of SZEAS v Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 1776 &amp; SZFKD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 46). Nor does the Minister submit that the applicant would inevitably have failed if the Tribunal had made findings under s.36(3) , (4) and (5). I do not consider that I could make that finding, in circumstances where the Indian domestic laws and immigration practices relating to the India Nepal Treaty of Friendship appear not to be clear (compare my judgments cited above and SZGXK v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 822 , also SZGXK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1891 , SZGXK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] HCASL 170 , WAGH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 194 ; (2003) 131 FCR 269 , SZLAN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 ; (2008) 171 FCR 145 , and SZMWQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2010] FCAFC 97). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 737">The Tribunal's findings might be understood to manifest the same error as was identified in SZGXK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1891 , namely, construing the Treaty as providing a right of entry when it does no such thing, at least expressly. However, I do not read the Tribunal's decision as an attempt to express how the Treaty should properly be construed. I find that the Tribunal did not attempt a construction or interpretation of the Treaty's provisions. Rather, it considered whether, in practice, the Treaty operates such that Nepalese nationals have a right to enter and reside in India.  The Tribunal reached its finding that Nepalese nationals can enter and reside in India based on the country information which it set out in its decision record describing how the Treaty actually operates and how, relevantly, it is implemented by the Government of India. Significantly, the existence of a right of entry and residence need not depend solely on the terms of the Treaty. As Smith FM said at first instance in SZGXK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FMCA 822 at [38] : The error by the Tribunal as to the legal effect of the treaty under Indian law might, however, not have jurisdictional implications, if the Tribunal's ultimate conclusion as to a right coming within s.36(3) could be supported by the other evidence cited by the Tribunal from the DFAT reports. As I have identified above, some of the information given in the DFAT reports might possibly support a finding that, independently of the legal effects of the treaty, India generally gave Nepalese persons in the position of this applicant, who are outside its territory, a right to enter and reside in its territory. Even if the evidence was highly equivocal as to the existence of an underlying "right to enter and reside" which explained the settlement of large numbers of Nepalese in India, a court on judicial review should be slow to find that it was not open to the Tribunal to infer the existence of such a right enforceable under Indian law. Particularly, since current authority, which is binding upon me, placed on the visa applicant the evidentiary burden of proof to the contrary (see Graham J in SZLAN (supra) at [58]). 
On appeal, Graham J approved these comments in SZGXK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1891 at [31] . </sentence>
