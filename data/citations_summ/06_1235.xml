<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 677">The Federal Court and this Court have exclusive "jurisdiction in bankruptcy" under s.27(1) of the Bankruptcy Act . [34] The exercise of jurisdiction to commence or take any fresh step in a proceeding in respect of a provable debt is the exercise of jurisdiction in bankruptcy for the purposes of s.27(1) of the Bankruptcy Act . That jurisdiction continues to be exercisable notwithstanding the second respondent's discharge from bankruptcy, because: Discharge of a bankrupt does not spell the end of the trustee's duties to distribute to creditors such property as remains vested in the trustee. Property, including choses in action, which has vested in a trustee by reason of bankruptcy continues to be so vested after the discharge of the bankrupt. ... It would seem to be implicit in the continuing responsibility of the trustee for the distribution of the former bankrupt's estate to creditors, in respect of proof of all debts, that the leave requirement under s58(3) remains in place to the extent that there is a dispute about the existence of such debt. Such leave could authorise a resolution of that dispute in separate proceedings. The leave requirement is not expressly limited in time. .... [35] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1238">It has not been established that it is open to the Court to grant leave outside the circumstances in which s.58(3) applies. Were there still uncertainty about whether the Supreme Court proceedings in question were in respect of a provable debt such uncertainty could have been addressed as it was addressed by French J (as he then was) in Norilya Minerals Pty Ltd, In the matter of Dean Edward Ireland v Adam Jonathon Ireland as named Executor of the Estate of Dean Edward Ireland [2006] FCA 1235. On that basis leave could have been sought and granted if and to the extent to which the Supreme Court proceedings constituted or included a claim provable in the bankruptcy of the Ferellas. Had I been able to proceed on this basis I might well have granted leave on the evidence now before me, particularly given that it is now apparent that the objectives of the Bankruptcy Act will not be subverted by allowing the contemplated fresh step in the Supreme Court proceedings to be taken. However in light of the fact that it is properly conceded by the applicants that the Supreme Court proceedings are not in respect of a provable debt, such an approach is not open. Section 58(3)(b) is not applicable and this Court should not purport to grant leave out of an " abundance of caution " in such circumstances. </sentence>
