16 This "balancing test" has been applied frequently in later cases: for example Re Georges, Midas Australia Pty Ltd (admin apptd) [2009] FCA 38 ; Re Hayes; Estate Property Group Ltd [2007] FCA 935). If the approach is to "balance" the expectation of speedy administration against the risk of prejudice, there cannot be any predisposition in favour of speedy administration, for that would skew the balancing process. Rather, the cases suggest that where the administrator proves a substantial ground in any of the categories that I have set out, and there is no specific evidence of prejudice, an extension commensurate with the administrator's task will be granted, notwithstanding that the Explanatory Memorandum suggested that extensions would not be granted frequently.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 70">The task for the court was recently summarised by Kenny J in the following way, in Re Georges; Midas Australia Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2009] FCA 38 at para 11, as follows: 
 The authorities establish that, where an application is made under section 439A(6) for an extension of time, the court must strike a balance between the expectation that the administration be conducted relatively speedily and summarily and the need to ensure that undue speed not prejudice sensible and constructive actions directed towards maximising the return for creditors and shareholders.
