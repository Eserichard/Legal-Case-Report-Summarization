<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VSC 524">31 The claim that the beneficial interest in the properties was held by the family trust was based on two matters. The first was that Mr Vasiliou said he had made a gift of the property to the trustee in October 1987. Jessup J found that Mr Vasiliou had not done everything to vest the legal title to the properties in Optquest as donee and therefore equity would not recognise the gift as complete. [20]  (b) The risks associated with having a second "live" certificate of title in existence, can be overcome by the making of orders akin to those made in Marshall v Williams --- if such orders are made, the principles of the Torrens system are not undermined. (c) Whilst Optquest and/or Mr Vasiliou or Ms Apostolou may hold or control the existing certificates of title, neither they nor the family trust have any beneficial interest in the property. (d) The beneficial interest in the property vested automatically in Mr Marchesi upon the bankruptcy of Mr Vasiliou [38] and Mr Marchesi is entitled to be registered as proprietor. [39] Therefore, it is not necessary for any vesting order to be made by the Court. In that sense, Mr Marchesi is one step further along the line than the plaintiffs in many of the earlier cases where the application was for a vesting order with ancillary orders sought under s 103. 2 The question of the beneficial ownership of the property was the subject of proceedings in the Federal Court before Jessup J. The reasons for judgment [1] record that in 1987 Optquest was appointed as the trustee of the Vasiliou Family Trust. Shortly before Optquest was deregistered in 1995, the company was replaced by Mr Vasiliou as trustee and he was subsequently replaced in 2003 by his wife, Ms Vasiliki Apostolou, as trustee. Mr Vasiliou and Ms Apostolou as trustee for the trust, were parties to the Federal Court proceedings but Optquest (which was deregistered at the time) was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] VSC 213">Sole Director/Secretary of 34 Sandra Street, Bulleen, Vic, 3105 A Person Authorised to SIGN for the Company". Optquest 
 
 5 A current and historical company extract of Optquest provided by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 20 March 2009 discloses that Optquest was registered on 11 August 1987. On 7 July 1995 the company was deregistered [1] and remained deregistered at the time when the first defendant became bankrupt. The registration of the company was reinstated on 3 December 2008 on the application of the first defendant. The effect of reinstatement was that the registration of the company continues as if deregistration had not occurred. As it ultimately transpired, in view of the fact (as I refer below) that the Full Court remitted the proceeding for retrial, the plaintiff did not cause the Notice of Motion to be fixed for hearing and accordingly it stood dismissed. 25 On 21 December 2006 the Full Court of the Federal Court allowed the appeal from, and set aside, the judgment and orders of 23 August 2006 and remitted the proceeding for retrial. The retrial was had before Jessup J who gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff on 4 July 2007 [8] . 26 Jessup J found that the properties were beneficially owned by the first defendant at the date when he became bankrupt. Accordingly, he declared that the beneficial title to the Alfriston, St Kilda and Claremont properties had vested in the plaintiff pursuant to s 58 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 129">10 The primary judge found that the executed TL Act transfers were left in the custody of Mr Dwyer, a solicitor acting for Mr Vasiliou, and that they were never delivered to Optquest. Accordingly, they remained in the custody of Mr Vasiliou, or his agent, throughout. Applying the equitable principles respecting the requirements for the perfection of a gift in land, his Honour further found that Mr Vasiliou, as donor, did not, therefore, do everything necessary on his part to vest the legal title to the subject properties in Optquest as donee. It followed, according to his Honour, that equity would not recognise the gift as complete and that Mr Vasiliou held the full beneficial title to the subject properties at all times (see Marchesi v Apostolou [2007] FCA 986 (" Marchesi v Apostolou ") at [77]).
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 2038">Milroy v Lord , as well as Corin v Patton , were considered by the Federal Court in Marchesi v Apostolou [2007] FCA 986 , a case in which a bankrupt was held not to have made an effective gift of land to a trustee because the donor had not done everything necessary to be done to transfer the registered title. Although there were certain factual differences, the same issue exercised the court in both Marchesi v Apostolou and Corin v Patton ; namely, the donor had done all that was necessary to place the vesting of the legal title within the control of the donee and beyond the recall or intervention of the donor. In both those cases the donee was a third party trustee. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] SASC 390">Bearing in mind all evidence and submissions, I consider that there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that Andersons solicitors, in particular Mr Condon, were acting for both the deceased and Neil Jones. As a consequence, it is unnecessary for me to decide what the situation had been if Mr Condon was the solicitor for both the donor and the donee. [8] However, I note Mr Roder's submission that even if there was a "blurring of the lines", the relevant principle is that a donor must deliver the Transfer to the donee, which was not done in this case. In support of this proposition, Mr Roder directed my attention to the following comments of Jessup J in Marchesi v Apostolou : [9] 
 
 the same solicitor acts for donor and donee, and has possession of the executed transfer, the question will be whether the point has arrived at which the solicitor now holds the transfer as agent of the donee rather than of the donor. Absent an artificial ceremony of some kind, the delivery of the transfer from the solicitor acting for the donor to the same person acting for the donee will inevitably be notional rather than actual. Even if there was delivery of the Transfer to Neil Jones, I accept Mr Roder's submission that the second requirement, namely the deceased's requisite intention to part with the land has not been met. Both the documentary evidence and Neil Jones' oral evidence demonstrates that it was the deceased's intention that Neil Jones would not acquire the land until the stamp duty had been paid and the Transfer registered. Neither of these things were done, and as a consequence I am unable to find that the deceased intended to part with the land "there and then" when she handed the unregistered Transfer to Andersons solicitors. In making this finding I rely on the following comments by Jessup J in Marchesi v Apostolou : [17] 
 
the donor has every intention of making a gift, but the only act which he or she has done is to deliver an executed transfer to his or her own solicitor, agent or bailee, he or she will not be regarded as having done everything necessary on his or her part to vest the legal estate in the donee...So long as the donor's own agent holds the transfer, more is required to be done by the donor.

The first is that he is an undischarged bankrupt and the beneficial interest in the land in Claremont Street constituting the basis of his objection, is now vested in his trustee in bankruptcy.
