<citphrase id="cp17.20" type=cited from="[1981] FCA 46">(a) once a bankruptcy notice has been served on a debtor and an affidavit has been filed purportedly showing that the debtor has a counterclaim, set-off or cross demand of the type mentioned in s. 40(1)(g) of the act, the time for compliance with the notice is automatically extended until the court determines whether the affidavit does establish that the debtor has such a counterclaim, set-off or cross demand. no order of the court is required to extend the time limited for compliance with the bankruptcy notice prior to the determination of this issue. (b) no general inherent power could be implied by which the court could extend the time for compliance with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice because: (i) such a power was expressly excluded from the general powers conferred by s. 33(1)(c) of the act; (ii) by s. 41(6a) in certain specified circumstances the court has express power to extend this time limit.  (2) per deane and lockhart jj.</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp17.21" type=cited from="[1981] FCA 46">(a) any counterclaim, set-offs or cross demand within s. 40(1)(g) of the act must be a claim for a money sum, whether liquidated or unliquidated, or for the immediate delivery of a specific chattel of ascertainable value. re jocumsen (1929), 1 abc 82 ; vogwell v. vogwell (1939), 11 abc 83 ; re a bankruptcy notice, (1934) 1 ch 431 ; re a debtor, (1958) 1 ch 81 , referred to.  (3) per deane and lockhart jj.</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp17.22" type=cited from="[1981] FCA 46">the present cross-claim as deposed to in the affidavits of the respondent was not for a money sum or the delivery of a specific chattel; it could therefore not be a "counter-claim, set-off or cross demand" within s. 40(1)(g).  (4) per fisher j.</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp17.23" type=cited from="[1981] FCA 46">the facts deposed to by the respondent did not establish that the appellant was under any personal liability to the respondent by reason of his claim. therefore it was not established that the counterclaim, set-off or cross demand was in the same right as the personal claim of the appellant upon which the bankruptcy notice was based, being a judgment debt for money lent.</citphrase>
