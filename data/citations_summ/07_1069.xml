<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 318">Justice Finn outlined the history of Mr Kowalski's dispute with Mitsubishi and AMP Super including in the South Australian State Courts and, in particular, the orders made in the South Australian Supreme Court declaring him to be a vexatious litigant. In a judgment delivered on 24 July 2007, his Honour ordered that the proceeding be dismissed in so far as it claimed relief under the Trade Practices Act on the basis that the claim was unarguable and had no reasonable prospects of success; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd ACN 064 829 616 [2007] FCA 1069 [2007] FCA 1069 ; , (2007) 242 ALR 370. Nevertheless Finn J found, at [32], that, however misconceived, Mr Kowalski "properly and genuinely believed" that the Trade Practices Act applied. His Honour otherwise dismissed the respondent's notice of motion and gave leave to Mr Kowalski to file and serve an amended application and statement of claim.  Ms Bochner also provided "a chronological summary of the corresponding Federal Court decisions in relation to proceedings instituted by the Respondent". She lists 33 decisions in respect of which written reasons were given. I have added another decision (number 34) that was relied upon by the applicants and discussed in their submissions although not listed in Ms Bochner's affidavit. The citations for those decisions and other relevant details are as follows: Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd (1998) FCR 55 , SG 100 of 1997, 16 October 1998; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1153 , SAD 190 of 2001, 17 September 2002; Kowalski v Trustee of Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 14 , SAD 234 of 2002, 15 January 2003; Kowalski v Trustee, Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 18 , SAD 234 of 2002, 28 February 2003; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1069 , (2000) 242 ALR 370 SAD 11 of 2007, 24 July 2007; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 691 , SAD 11 of 2007, 20 May 2008; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2008] FCA 1873 , SAD 171 of 2008, 4 December 2008; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1970 , SAD 168 of 2008, 22 December 2008; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 47 , SAD 216 of 2008, 30 January 2009; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 48 , SAD 205 of 2008, 3 February 2009; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 153 , SAD 3 of 2009, 27 February 2009; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 , SAD 168 of 2008, 30 July 2009; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCAFC 107, (2009) 259 ALR 444 ; SAD 26 of 2009, 14 August 2009; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 , SAD 171 of 2008, 3 September 2009; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 117 , (2009) 259 ALR 319 ; SAD 20 of 2009, 9 September 2009; Kowalski v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2009] FCA 1044 , SAD 75 of 2009, 17 September 2009; Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia [2009] FCA 1072 , SAD 81 of 2009, 23 September 2009; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 1289 , SAD 133 of 2009, 9 November 2009; Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia [2009] FCA 1420 , SAD 165 of 2009, 2 December 2009;  The relief for which these rules provide is extreme. It deprives the person subject to the order of a right that is fundamental to the preservation of a civil society governed by the rule of law, namely the right to call on the Court to resolve a dispute or adjudicate a claim simply by filing an application in the prescribed form. For this reason such an order is not made lightly: Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1069 at [44] ; Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378 at [51] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1170">On two occasions Finn J refused to summarily dismiss this application, and gave the applicant leave to file and serve an amended application and statement of claim: see Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1069 ; (2007) 242 ALR 370 and Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 691. On a third occasion, 5 February 2009, his Honour struck out the applicant's further amended statement of claim, and the proceeding was summarily dismissed pursuant to s 31A of the FCA Act. His Honour found that the applicant's claim that a benefit should have been paid to him on the cessation of his employment in 1994 had no reasonable prospects of success on the basis that no formal application was made to the Trustee at that time and there was no evidence that the Trustee was informed of, or provided with, any medical evidence as to his entitlement. In relation to the claim that the Trustee should have considered his entitlement to a benefit in November 1998, his Honour found that there were also no reasonable prospects of success as again no formal application was made to the Trustee at that time. In relation to the Trustee's treatment of his application for the benefit in 2005, his Honour held that it also enjoyed no reasonable prospects of success as it was clear that the Trustee had considered and reconsidered his claim on a number of occasions between 1999 and 2005, and the Trustee was entitled to decline to re-entertain the same matter in the absence of a change of circumstances. His Honour further found that none of the breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty claims raised by the applicant had any reasonable prospects of success: see Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 53. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] NSWSC 789">10 Although this is an application that the defendants be punished for civil contempt, not criminal contempt, it is clear that the charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525. Where the contempt consists of a failure to comply with an order of the court, it must be demonstrated that the contempt was wilful and not merely casual, accidental or unintentional: Australasian Meat Industries Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Limited [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98. However, it is not necessary for the applicant to prove that the contemnor intended to breach an order of the court: see Anderson v Hassett [2007] NSWSC 1310 ; Australasian Meat Industries Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Limited [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 111; Matthews v ASIC [2009] NSWCA 155 at [16] per Tobias JA. Nor is it necessary to prove that the contemnor was aware that his or her conduct constituted a breach of the orders: Microsoft Corporation v Marks (No 1) (1996) 69 FCR 117 at 143 per Lindgren J; Metcash Trading Ltd v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 at [9] per Finn J; Matthews v ASIC [2009] NSWCA 155 at [16] per Tobias JA. The order alleged to be breached must be clear and unambiguous: Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 515-6 per Owen J; Metcash Trading Ltd v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 at [9] per Finn J. It must also be capable of being complied with: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1069 at [40] ; Matthews v ASIC [2009] NSWCA 155 at [16] per Tobias JA; Metcash Trading Ltd v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 at [9] per Finn J. The same principles apply where the obligation arises from an undertaking given to the court rather than an order of the court: Trade Practices Commission v CG Smith Pty Ltd ( 1978) 30 FCR 368 at 375; Spindler v Balog (1957) 76 WN (NSW) 391 ; Biba Ltd v Stratford Investments Ltd [1973] Ch 281. Finally, the relevant application must be served personally on the contemnor. Service in accordance with an order for substituted service satisfies this requirement: Anderson v Hassett [2007] NSWSC 1310.

59 The primary judge commenced his reasons for judgment of 5 February 2009 by saying:
 '1 On two previous occasions I have refused summarily to dismiss Mr Kowalski's application and gave him leave to file and serve an amended application and statement of claim: see Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1069 ; (2007) 242 ALR 370 and Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 691. On the latter occasion I indicated that I was providing him with his last opportunity to provide an intelligible and unobjectionable pleading. I have, though with little optimism, recommended to him that he obtain competent legal assistance. He has to date demonstrated little understanding both of the law he seeks to invoke in his own favour and of how to present, albeit in lay form, a clear statement of the claim he seeks to prosecute. My recommendation was not accepted. As he has done in so many proceedings in this Court and in other courts and tribunals concerning his relationship with his past employer, Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd (MMAL), he acted without legal representation on the motion presently before me. That motion, brought by the two respondents, again seeks the summary dismissal of the proceeding pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) or else under O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules . 2 I intend to make a summary order under s 31A giving judgment for the respondents in relation to the whole proceeding. ' (Emphasis added)  8 It would not be inappropriate to describe the relationship between Mr Kowalski and Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited as an acrimonious one. A brief history of the disputation may be found in the judgment of the primary judge of 24 July 2007 ( Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (ACN 064 829 616) [2007] FCA 1069 ; (2007) 242 ALR 370. That judgment was given in the first instance proceedings No. SAD 11 of 2007.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1305">58 In Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd) [2007] FCA 1069 ; (2007) 242 ALR 370 at 380, [44] , Finn J observed of O 21 r 1 and r 2:
 
 
 [44] By way of background to the application of these provisions, it is important to have regard to the fundamental principle on which they entrench. This is that every person has a "constitutional right" of access to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain redress in consequence of an alleged breach of his or her rights by some other person: Bremer Vulkan Schiffbau Und Maschinenfabrik v South India Shipping Corp Ltd [1981] AC 909 at 977 ; [1980] 1 All ER 289 at 295; Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378 at 389 ; [1999] FCA 907 ; Freeman v National Australia Bank Ltd [2006] FCAFC 67 ; (2006) 230 ALR 213 at 218---19 ; [2006] FCAFC 67. The purpose of the powers given under the Rules is to reinforce the power of the court to protect its own processes against unwarranted usurpation of its time and resources and to avoid the loss caused to those who have to face actions which lack any substance: Jones v Skyring [1992] HCA 39 ; [1992] HCA 39 ; (1992) 109 ALR 303 at 312; [1992] HCA 39 ; 66 ALJR 810 at 814. This said, an order under the Rules will not lightly be made because of its serious impact on the right of access to the courts of this country.  54 Nonetheless, I note that in Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd) [2007] FCA 1069 ; (2007) 242 ALR 370 Finn J entertained, but did not grant, an application made in an existing proceeding for relief under O 21 r 1 and r 2 as a sequel to a summary judgment application. Though the effect, if any, of O 21 r 3 with respect to the practice and procedure in respect of seeking to engage the powers conferred by O 21 r 1 and r 2 is not mentioned in that case, neither it must be said, is it mentioned in Ramsey v Skyring, National Australia Bank Limited v Freeman (a Bankrupt) and Granich and Associates v Yap . </sentence>
