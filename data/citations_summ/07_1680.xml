<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 552">Until recently, the preponderance of authority in relation to the amendment of pleadings was to the effect that leave to amend would only be granted where it would not result in prejudice to the other party for which costs and appropriate procedural orders could not adequately compensation; see Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 , per Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, at 154-5; per Kirby J, esp. at 167ff. However, the approach endorsed in J L Holdings did not entail, as Heerey J pointed out in GMCA Pty Ltd v Black &amp; Decker Inc [2007] FCA 1680 , at [4], that "procedural indulgences must always be granted and that the salve of costs will always be sufficient". At the margins, it has been a vexed question of how considerations of justice, in the sense of allowing a party to advance a reasonably arguable claim, at whatever point in the litigation it may be raised, are to be reconciled with principles of case management which may militate, in the circumstances of a given case, against allowing a party to bring, maintain or amend a claim. The question has excited differences of judicial opinion, often expressed in robust terms. Ordinarily, however, the question turns on an exercise of discretion in the light of the factual circumstances of the particular case. As was recognised in Sali v SPC [1993] HCA 47 ; (1993) 116 ALR 625 , this has meant that the grant or refusal of an amendment is mot appropriately to be left to the trial (or docket) judge, who exercises a discretion conferred by the relevant Rules of Court, which will not "lightly be set aside on appeal", because the test to be applied by the appellate court is that identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 as applicable to reviews of the exercise of judicial discretion. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 447">Mr Heath rightly points me to the decision of Heerey J in GMAC Pty Ltd v Black &amp; Decker Inc [2007] FCA 1680 where his Honour said that J L Holdings : "Is not authority for the proposition that amendments, adjournments and other procedural indulgences must always be granted and that the balm of costs will always be sufficient.</sentence>
