<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 91">Perhaps the most apposite description of the nature of the Tribunal's error in this case is to be found in the approach taken by Flick J in SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 168 FCR 1 ; [2008] FCA 390 at [40] to [44]. In that case the Tribunal had found that the visa applicant had been asked when the National Conference of the Awami League and/or the Ajebo League was to be held but that he was not able to specify when it was held, beyond citing the year 2006. However, as pointed out by Flick J, in fact the visa applicant had at no time specified that the National Conference was to be held in 2006 and, more importantly, he had never been asked when the National Conference was to be held (see SZDFZ at [37] --- [38]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 156">In this case, some of the key elements of the first appellant's history were accepted by the delegate, or at least not rejected by the delegate. The first Tribunal accepted, for the most part, the key elements of the first appellant's history. This Court has held that, in considering what issues an applicant (absent action by the Tribunal) is entitled to assume are dispositive, regard may be had to a previous Tribunal decision which has been quashed: SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1 at 7 [20] - [21] , 8-9 [28]. I do not need to consider the position where the delegate and a previous Tribunal have considered different issues to be dispositive because the outcome of this appeal does not turn on that issue.  It is important to note that SZBEL involved the first and only review by the Tribunal of the delegate's decision not, as here, a second review by a reconstituted Tribunal where the first Tribunal had made findings and come to conclusions on the issues it thought arose in relation to the decision under review. In SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 168 FCR 1 ; [2008] FCA 390 (" SZDFZ "), Flick J considered the obligation under s 425 of the Act where this occurs, that is, where a second or reconstituted Tribunal is conducting a review of a delegate's decision after the first Tribunal's decision has been set aside. About this situation, his Honour observed (at [19]): 
 
 First, it is not considered that "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review" are to be defined in all cases by the decision of the delegate. ... The issues which a delegate considers dispositive of the application may well be the issues which an applicant has to confront and answer when an appeal is lodged with the tribunal, eg SZJKU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 308 at [37] ---[45] per Emmett J. But the object of s 425 is to ensure that an applicant is given an opportunity "to give evidence and present arguments", being evidence and argument "relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review". And that is an obligation imposed upon the tribunal hearing the application before it, whether it be the tribunal initially hearing the application or any subsequent tribunal.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 535">The application of the principle in SZBEL to such a specific issue was also said to be consistent with the approach taken by Flick J in SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 168 FCR 1 ; [2008] FCA 390 in relation to the width of the concept " the issues arising in relation to the decision under review" in s.425(1) of the Act (and see the remarks of Gray J in SZHKA and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 172 FCR 1 ; [2008] FCAFC 138). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 489">When the applicant says that " I did not even get the voter election, a voter ID. I did not vote ", this could easily have been interpreted by the Tribunal to mean that he failed to do this of his own volition rather than as a result of Awami League manipulation of the electoral role. The applicant prays in aid the decision of Flick J in SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1. In that case Flick J said at [41]: "The present finding of the Tribunal, however, involves no resolution of competing facts and no process of reasoning be it logical or illogical. More importantly it is a finding which positively misstates what had occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 311">On 20 January 2010 the applicant filed an application for review of the decision of the Tribunal by this Court. There were three grounds of application. The first was: "The Tribunal erred in law, amounting to jurisdictional error, to find that I shall not be persecuted for a Convention-based reason if returned back to India for my political belief as a member of congress. The Tribunal found failed (sic) to consider that I was a political activist. The considered (sic) that I established relationship with congress on business purpose and ignored the harassment suffered in India for my political belief and made errors of jurisdiction. " 
This ground seems to me to be no more than a statement that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by coming to a conclusion adverse to that of the applicant. It is not a jurisdictional error not to be satisfied that an applicant's story is true: SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 390. An argument based upon a claim that the Tribunal " got it wrong " is a request for merits review, and such a review impermissible under the Migration Act , which strictly limits the jurisdiction of this Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 71">I also accept that the Tribunal may fall into jurisdictional error if it makes a finding which seriously misstates what has occurred [7] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 104">The cases where a Tribunal is found to have fallen into jurisdictional error because it made its decision based upon factual findings not supported by evidence such as: SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 390 ; SFGB v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 231 ; QAAA of 2004 v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1918 ; NASA v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 653 are all cases where the finding was significant on its face and did not require considering distinctions in phraseology.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 1165">Mr Karp also referred the Court to SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 390 per Flick J and in particular to paragraphs 21, 22, and 24 for the purpose of guidance and instruction about the "width of the word 'issue'". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 1091">The first mention of the ECOWAS, Mr Karp submitted, was in the Tribunal decision. The opportunity of flight to another (ECOWAS) country was not raised at any time, either in the interview with the delegate or at the Tribunal hearing. Whilst the fact that the delegate had rejected all the Applicant's claims put his claims at "issue" ( SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [23] at [47]), the Tribunal was not entitled to reject a claim on the basis of undisclosed information if that information raises an issue in the proceedings. He referred to the decision of Flick J in SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [24] where his Honour said at [23]: An inflexible attempt to define those "issues' in a particular way may tend to divert attention from the principal concern of s 425 , namely to ensure that an applicant is given a meaningful opportunity to be heard. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] HCATrans 289">One is a decision of Justice Flick called SZDFZ [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1 ,which is in the bundle prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 530">[18] Third, to the extent that the possibility of a finding that s 91R(3) might operate adversely against the applicant, and the issue of the genuineness of the 'detention document' were new 'issues' on the review, each of these 'issues' was discussed with the applicant by the third Tribunal member. [19] Therefore, all critical and essential issues dispositive of the Tribunal's decision were raised with the applicant at the second hearing by the third Tribunal member. [20] The second issue: SZGYT The Tribunal's Findings and Reasons reveal that the Tribunal considered and then disregarded the claimed conduct of the applicant in "joining a Falun Gong practice group" in Australia. [21] However, due to the language used by the Tribunal a question arises as to whether, as in SZGYT v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 883 per Driver FM, the Tribunal's reasoning gave rise to an inference that the Tribunal had considered the applicant's conduct in Australia only at the time he commenced (or joined) Falun Gong in Australia: see SZGYT at [9]. In the present case, there is ultimately no basis for concluding that the Tribunal overlooked the applicant's motivation for engaging in any Falun Gong conduct after he joined a Falun Gong group in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCA 528">Fact finding is the province of the tribunal. Ordinarily, an error of fact by the tribunal will not constitute a jurisdictional error, let alone an error of law. There is no error of law in simply making a wrong finding of fact: Enfield City v Development Assessment Commission ; [2000] HCA 5 ; (2000) 199 CLR 135 at 154 [44] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. Mr Toro Martinez accepted that position. However, he argued that the tribunal's conclusion that he would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia was not a finding that the tribunal could make on any fair reading of the totality of the material on which it was based. He relied on the principle that if a decision-maker made a finding that was a critical step in arriving at its ultimate conclusion, but had no evidence to support it, the finding may well constitute a jurisdictional error: SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 at 407 [19] per Mansfield, Selway and Bennett JJ; SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [32] per Greenwood J; SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1 at 12 [42] per Flick J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCA 621">The appellant then made an application for review to the Federal Magistrates Court. In essence there was only one ground, namely, that the appellant had given adequate evidence to the Tribunal that he was physically assaulted and that he had provided evidence to the Tribunal that a friend of his who had been with him in the Babri mosque incident had been killed by Muslim criminals. He claimed that the Tribunal failed to consider his genuine claim. The Federal Magistrate dealt with this argument as follows (at [11]): 
 The Tribunal is the finder of fact in these matters and whilst it may have been a jurisdictional error not to consider the evidence put forward by the applicant it is not a jurisdictional error to come to a conclusion about it which the applicant finds inimicable: SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 390 at [40] per Flick J.

<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FMCA 356">In the absence of a transcript there is no reason to assume that the offer was not genuinely made. The decision record indicates that the representations were considered even if they were not accepted.

I am unable to find for the applicant in this regard. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FCA 315">The principle which I have identified by reference to the reasons of the Full Court has been applied by single judges of this Court: see, for example, SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 ; SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1 ; SZKMX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 856. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FMCA 92">In the instant case nothing was said about the claims that the Taliban had recently visited the applicant's home and indicated that he was likely to be seriously harmed should he return. I am satisfied that the claim constituted a dispositive issue because it went directly to the claim to have a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. Flick J when dealing with a case that had been before a previously constituted Tribunal in SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 390 at [19] said: 
 
 "First, it is not considered that "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review" are to be defined in all cases by the decision of the delegate. Their Honours in SZBEL did observe " But if the Tribunal takes no step to identify some issue other than those that the delegate considered dispositive, and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is, the applicant is entitled to assume that the issues the delegate considered dispositive are "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review" ... The issues which a delegate considers dispositive of the application may well be the issues which an applicant has to confront and answer when an appeal is lodged with the tribunal, eg SZJKU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 308 at [37] ---[45] per Emmett J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] FMCA 93">It would not follow that the Tribunal erred by asking such questions. Findings from the Applicant's answers If the Court were to consider that the Tribunal's conclusion that the Applicant was not a genuine Christian was not 'open to it on the evidence', or even that that finding was irrational, that would not in itself establish jurisdictional error by the Tribunal. [15] The Tribunal's findings were in any case clearly open to it. The Applicant answered some simple questions about Biblical characters and events correctly and others incorrectly; [16] he gave a very vague answer to a more analytical question about the 'Gospel message'; [17] he gave contradictory answers as to where and when he himself had been baptised, observing that 'it really just slips my mind'; [18] and he showed no appreciation of the existence of different Christian denominations. [19] This was an applicant who claimed to have had Christian parents, to have studied the Bible and to have introduced others to Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] FMCA 111">In regard to this complaint the Tribunal stated at [CB 108]: "The applicant provided to the Tribunal several graphic photographs of persons who had been decapitated and maimed. When asked about these photographs the applicant claimed that they were photographs of associates of his killed by Muslim extremists after the applicant had come to Australia. The applicant also provided newspaper articles about the killing of a certain person who he said he knew. However, while the Tribunal accepts that these photographs are photographs of persons brutally killed, they do not establish that the persons depicted are associates of the applicant or were people killed by Muslim extremists. The Tribunal does not place weight upon them as establishing that the applicant faces such harm on his return to India. Nor does the Tribunal place weight on the newspaper article as establishing the applicant faces harm on his return to India. " 
The Tribunal is the finder of fact in these matters and whilst it may have been a jurisdictional error not to consider the evidence put forward by the applicant it is not a jurisdictional error to come to a conclusion about it which the applicant finds inimicable: SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 390 at [40] per Flick J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FMCA 1715">More generally, the contention that the Tribunal's sentence was " self-contradictory " does not establish jurisdictional error. As Flick J pointed out in SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1 at [40] : " ... what may be described as 'illogical or irrational' inferences drawn from the facts before the Tribunal may often be an unhelpful characterisation of the reasoning process and may amount to no more than a conclusion that a Court may have reached a different factual conclusion ". While the Tribunal did not refer to particular country information, it had before it the information relied on by the delegate about Christianity in China as well as the information provided by the applicant's adviser. It has not been established that this finding was not grounded upon probative and logical grounds in the sense considered in SZLGP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1198. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FMCA 1433">Of course, findings of fact are the domain of the Tribunal: NABE v Minister for Immigration (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 at [53] . Merely a description of the Tribunal's reasoning as "illogical" or "irrational" may be nothing more than an emphatic way of expressing disagreement with those reasons: Minister for Immigration v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 at [40] (" Eshetu "); see also NACB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 235 at [29] ; SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 390 at [40] per Flick J and the authorities cited therein. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2008] FMCA 1239">There is considerable authority to the effect that want of logic in itself does not show jurisdictional error (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v W306/01A [2003] FCAFC 208 ; W404/01A of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 255 ; NATC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 52 in which the Full Court of the Federal Court referred at [25] to NACB as it did in VWST ). In SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 Greenwood J reviewed some of the authorities in relation to illogical or irrational reasoning (at [17] --- [30]) before suggesting (at [31] --- [32]) that the central matter was as follows: [32] A determination of the Tribunal as to a state of satisfaction or otherwise, of the relevant criteria or criterion in question, that is based upon a finding of fact or inferences drawn from facts, not based on logical or rational grounds, will give rise to an error of jurisdiction if there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing the inference; or, if there be some evidence, although inadequate, reliance by the Tribunal upon that inadequate evidence gives rise to an inference that the Tribunal has misconceived the test or is not, in reality, satisfied of the requisite matters, as a result of which there has been only a purported, rather than a real, exercise of the power conferred upon the Tribunal. 
(and see SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1 at [42] per Flick J). However, as discussed below, in this case it has not been established that the Tribunal erred in such a manner. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] FCA 1259">21 In some circumstances a departure by a reconstituted Tribunal from the findings and conclusions of an earlier Tribunal may constitute a denial of procedural fairness and a denial of the opportunity " to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review ", as required by s 425(1): eg SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 390. But such is not the present case. The Tribunal's reasons thus contain the following passage:
 The Tribunal again told the applicant that it had listened to the tapes of his two previous hearings with the first and second Tribunal and that this Tribunal may take into account what he had told previous Tribunals.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2008] FCA 1220">11 In relation to the allegation that the Tribunal had failed to disclose issues which arose on review, her Honour accepted SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 390 as authority for the proposition that the appellant should be taken to be on notice of the adverse credibility findings made against him by the first Tribunal. As such, the appellant was on notice of the "comprehensive nature of the adverse credibility findings made against him by the First Tribunal", and the second Tribunal was entitled to have regard to its findings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2008] FMCA 969">Nor could it be said that an issue accepted by the Tribunal as first constituted, such as that the applicant was "harmed in fights with opposing political activists" (CB 97) was rejected by the Tribunal as secondly constituted in the way which was disapproved by Flick J in SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 390. As the High Court said in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 81 ALJR 515 at 522---523 [47], there may be cases where the Tribunal's statements or questions during the hearing sufficiently indicate to an applicant that everything he or she says in support of the application is in issue. That is the case here. The secondly constituted Tribunal records comments it make to the applicant during the course of its hearing as follows: The Tribunal indicated that the inconsistencies in his evidence may lead the Tribunal to doubt his credibility more generally. The Tribunal indicated it may lead it to doubt that he had any association with the Liberal or Freedom Party or that he had any current association with the party or that it was currently active underground. (CB 215) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] FMCA 942">
It is to be noted that the "issues" are not to be defined too narrowly, but the distinction between "adverse conclusions" and "mental processes" may be an elusive one. A perusal of other recent cases before the Federal Court in which SZBEL has been applied has elucidated the following. In SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 100 ALD 575 ( "SZDFZ" ), Flick J said:
 
 "[10] "Considerable care", however, needs to be exercised in effecting a dichotomy between an "adverse conclusion ... which would not obviously be open on the known material" and "mental processes": SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 228 CLR 152 ; 231 ALR 592 ; 93 ALD 300 ; [2006] HCA 63 at [29] . Gleeson CJ, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ there referred to the argument then being advanced seeking to advance such a dichotomy and then applying that dichotomy to the facts before the Court. Their Honours observed: [31] Stated in this way, the argument seeks to elucidate the content of the requirements of procedural fairness by setting up a dichotomy.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] FCA 916">48 Mr Varess referred again to Justice Conti's decision in SZGKX and particularly his concluding comments at [31] and [32]. He also referred to the Full Court's decisions of NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 147 FCR 51 ; [2001] FCAFC 134 at [116] and [122] and to Flick J's decision in SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 390 at [40] - [43]. In particular at the end of [43] where Justice Flick described the evidence rejected in that case as evidence that: 'could not be regarded as irrelevant to the ultimate adverse findings as to credit'. Mr Varess submitted that the same could be said about the evidence that the Tribunal ignored in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2008] FCA 856">38 More recently, in SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 100 ALD 575 ; [2008] FCA 390 at [43] , Flick J made some observations on the circumstances when a Court should intervene in relation to errors of the kind identified above, as follows: 
 'Although the circumstances in which such errors as that which the Tribunal committed in the present case may be rare, when they do occur this Court should intervene unless it is satisfied that the error was non-prejudicial. Such a finding should not be made in the present appeal. The reconstituted Tribunal was clearly unimpressed with the Appellant's credibility - but it remains unknown which of a series of particular findings ultimately persuaded it that the Appellant's evidence was not to be accepted. The finding that the Appellant 'was asked' as to the when the national conference was to be held, when he clearly was not asked, could not be regarded as irrelevant to the ultimate adverse findings as to credit. ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2008] FMCA 550">Counsel for the First Respondent referred the Court to SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 390 (" SZDFZ ") where Flick J of the Federal Court of Australia stated at [20]: "Issues may arise out of the initial decision of a delegate; they may also arise out of a decision of an intervening tribunal that has been set aside by the Federal Magistrates Court with the consequence that a reconstituted tribunal is thereafter called upon to resolve afresh the claims made. A decision of any such intervening tribunal may resolve some factual issues adversely to an applicant but nevertheless proceed to uphold his claim. Just as those adverse factual findings of the intervening tribunal would need to be addressed before any subsequent tribunal, as "issues arising in relation to the decision under review", so too would favourable findings made by the intervening tribunal be issues arising in a like manner.
