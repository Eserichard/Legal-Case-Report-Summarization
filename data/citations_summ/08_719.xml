<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 136">Bell submitted that Ms Meaden's submissions in [14] and [15] above, namely, that to order particulars would be 'contrary to authority' do not withstand even cursory scrutiny. According to Bell: 
(1) They are contrary to FAI (No 1) ;
 
(2) They are contrary to what Jacobson J would have ordered, presumably after full argument, in Peter Hanne &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Village Life Ltd [2008] FCA 719 at [15] and [57];
 
(3) They are contrary to what occurred in Weimann v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 1292 at [24] , although the reasons for that order do not appear to be available. (Each of those proceedings concerned a class of group members defined by having entered into a litigation funding agreement: see Peter Hanne at [3] and Weimann v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 673 at [34] . )
 
Most importantly, according to Bell, none of the authorities cited by Ms Meaden demonstrate that it is in fact contrary to authority to provide particulars of the group members. What the cases cited by Ms Meaden, particularly Thomas v Powercor Australia , demonstrate is that in some cases the passivity of the group members' role might justify limiting the amount of involvement they have. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 1491">156 Mr Glasson referred to Peter Hanne &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Village Life Limited [2008] FCA 719 , where Jacobson J set aside a notice to produce which had been served in aid of a paragraph in a statement of claim which was his Honour had considered to be very general and liable to be struck out and to the reference there by Jacobson J (at [35] - [45]) to the observations of Young J (as his Honour then was) in Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Ltd [2006] FCA 944 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 435 , at [37] concerning pleadings of a high level of generality.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 407">The rule that, in general, relief is confined to that available on the pleadings secures a party's right to this basic requirement of procedural fairness. Accordingly, the circumstances in which a case may be decided on a basis different from that disclosed by the pleadings are limited to those in which the parties have deliberately chosen some different basis for the determination of their respective rights and liabilities. ...

See also: Peter Hanne &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Village Life Ltd [2008] FCA 719 at [33] to [42] per Jacobson J. And, in the context of a claim founded upon s 52 of the Trade Practices Act , it has been said to be " imperative that the factual basis upon which the section is alleged to be brought into play must be stated with appropriate clarity in a statement of claim. That is, of course, a fundamental principle of pleading ": Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (1999) 42 IPR 1 at 3 per Foster J. Merkel J also made reference to the manner in which a claim should be pleaded for contravention of s 52 in Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd (Unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Merkel J, 1 March 1999) as follows:
 
 
 [18] Criticism was also made by Esso of the misleading and deceptive conduct claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 516">No doubt because of the complexity of the proceeding, its progress was not particularly fast. On 22 May 2008, I ordered that the Statements of Claim which had been filed at the commencement of the proceedings be struck out: see Peter Hanne &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Village Life Limited [2008] FCA 719. </sentence>
