<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 475">The second and third decisions of the Tribunal were set aside in large part because they failed to consider an important aspect of the appellant's claim which focused on his inability to obtain state protection to exercise his right to protest and the involvement of the state in alleged persecutory conduct. See SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 91 at [65] to [69] and SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 321 at [28] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 274">The respondents submit that: even assuming ground 1.1 pleads a jurisdictional error, the pleaded error is not made out; that the Tribunal did in fact and in law conduct a fresh hearing untrammelled by the findings made, and the outcome reached, in the Purported Decision; that cases such as Sperway Constructions deal with: the meaning of "appeal" in the context of various statutory appeal rights; possible meanings include "appeal by way of re-hearing", "hearing de novo ", "appeal in the strict sense", etc; and ultimately, the meaning of the word "appeal" turns upon a proper construction of the statute containing the right of appeal; [14] the real question is whether the Tribunal complied with the writ of mandamus which did no more than require the Tribunal to act in accordance with the Migration Act --- including s.425 ; [15] that ground 1.1 is based on a mis-reading of the Tribunal Decision, in that: the Tribunal did not adopt any finding or conclusion made in the Purported Decision; and all that the Tribunal did was summarise the case presented by the applicant which resulted in the Purported Decision; there is, in principle, no difference between following a course, such as that adopted by the Tribunal here, and noting a previous inconsistent statement made by the applicant before the Delegate or in the documents lodged with the Tribunal in support of the application for review, and, therefore, there can be no objection to the Tribunal taking into account the previous evidence presented by the applicant leading to the making of the Purported Decision; there is no objection to a trial judge adopting word for word an extract from a party's outline of submissions, so long as the judge brings to bear an independent mind, and is seen to do so, [16] and, by analogy, there can be no objection to the Tribunal adopting a conclusion made by a previous Tribunal; and there is nothing in the Tribunal's Decision to suggest that the Tribunal considered itself bound by a finding or conclusion in the Purported Decision.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] RRTA 278">Justice Logan held that the Tribunal had been obliged to telephone [Business A] to inquire 'as to whether there had been a forfeiture or confiscation of an interest which the male Appellant had at that farm or perhaps just as to why he was no longer employed there': see SZLGP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1470 at [50] per Logan J. The matter is now before the Tribunal pursuant to the orders of the Federal Court. Since it has been held that it is incumbent on the Tribunal in such a case to make it clear on the face of its reasons how it has discharged its obligation to reconsider the matter according to law - see SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 321 at [21] per Reeves J - I note that the Tribunal has made the inquiries which Justice Logan held that it had been obliged to make as referred to in paragraph 49 below. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 181">It was also contended that the first Tribunal decision and/or the " purported " decision of Scarlett FM affected the Tribunal as reconstituted in making an unfavourable decision. This contention is not made out. The Tribunal as reconstituted engaged in a reconsideration de novo of the applicant's claims. It extended a fresh invitation to the applicant to attend a Tribunal hearing and it did not overlook the basis on which Scarlett FM found jurisdictional error on the part of the first Tribunal in a manner indicative of jurisdictional error (cf SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2009) 108 ALD 108 ; [2009] FCA 321). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 138">Counsel for the Applicant submitted that because the Tribunal accepted that the Applicant had participated in low level protests, although it rejected his claim of having been an organiser or leader of protests, the Tribunal was obliged to consider whether participants in low level protests were at risk of persecution in China for a Convention related reason. In support of that submission, Mr Reynolds referred to SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 321 where Jacobson J found that it was an error for a tribunal to fail to consider the question of whether an applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution in circumstances where his land had been illegally confiscated by the local government and developers. However, the facts of that case are entirely distinguishable from the case before this Court. As is stated above, it is clear from the Applicant's claims, that he does not assert that the confiscation was illegal. He explains in his protection visa application that he was told that his land would be turned into a commercial fishery farm and leased to contractors. Further, he was paid compensation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 145">The third Tribunal member handed down his decision on 5 June 2008. He again affirmed the delegate's decision. The applicant again sought judicial review. It was unsuccessful in this Court (see SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1721) , but succeeded in the Federal Court before Reeves J (see SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2009) 108 ALD 10 , [2009] FCA 321). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 1200">The applicant relied on the decision of Reeves J in SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 321 ; (2009) 108 ALD 108. It was submitted that his Honour had held in SZGUW that where a decision of a Tribunal is quashed by a court: it is incumbent on the reconstituted Tribunal to make it clear on the face of its reasons how it has discharged its obligation to reconsider the matter according to law, specifically in view of the rulings made by the court when quashing the earlier decision; and this duty involves recording the error of law identified by the court in its decision, separately and distinctly assessing that error of law and considering how it should take it into account in its review of the delegate's decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] RRTA 1017">The matter is now before the Tribunal. Since it has been held that it is incumbent on the Tribunal in such a case to make it clear on the face of its reasons how it has discharged its obligation to reconsider the matter according to law - see SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 321 at [21] per Reeves J - I note for the sake of completeness that for the reasons given below I do not regard the applicant as a witness of truth and having regard to the obvious problems on the face of the documents which the applicant has produced in corroboration of his claims I consider that these documents were forged or fabricated and I give them no weight. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] MRTA 1657">The matter is now before the Tribunal pursuant to the orders of the Federal Magistrate. Since it has been held that it is incumbent on the Tribunal in such a case to make it clear on the face of its reasons how it has discharged its obligation to determine the matter according to law - see SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 321 at [21] per Reeves J - I note for the sake of completeness that the procedural defects identified by Scarlett FM have hopefully been overcome by the constituting of the matter to a different Member of the Tribunal and the holding of a fresh hearing. As will be apparent below, the focus of this hearing was on a different issue from that relied on by the delegate and by the first Tribunal. </sentence>
