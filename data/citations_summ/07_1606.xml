<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 331">The second qualification criterion for DSP requires that any impairments warrant a rating of 20 or more points under the Impairment Tables set out at Schedule 1B of the Act. The Tables set out empirical thresholds in relation to the effect of a person's impairments on his or her ability to do work --- the impairments to be assessed are functional impairments resulting from conditions that have been fully documented and diagnosed [20] . Furthermore, as the preamble to the Impairment Tables makes clear, an impairment rating is only to be assigned under the relevant Tables if the diagnosed condition has been investigated, treated and stabilised and is considered to be permanent: likely to continue for more than 2 years with or without reasonable treatment. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 264">I am bound by a decision of the Federal Court of Australia to bear in mind that paragraphs 4 and 6 of the Introduction to Schedule 1B of the Act set out a number of "mandatory requirements" that must be considered and satisfied before any impairment rating can be assigned to a condition: Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Parry [2007] FCA 1606. Paragraph 4 states that a rating is only to be assigned after a comprehensive history and examination. I am satisfied that Ms McCormack has been comprehensively examined by Dr Radovic and Dr Farrell. Paragraph 5 of the Introduction requires the condition to be permanent before a rating can be attributed under the Impairment Tables. Once a condition has been diagnosed, treated and stabilised, it is accepted as being permanent if in the light of available evidence it is more likely than not that it will persist for the foreseeable future. It is important to mention that the introduction to Table 6 states that Table 6 is used for permanent psychiatric disorders only. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 606">Clauses 4, 5 and 6 of the Introduction to the Impairment Tables make it clear that an applicant's condition must be a "fully documented, diagnosed condition which has been investigated, treated and stabilised" before the Impairment Tables can be applied to assign an impairment rating. Assessment that a condition has been fully treated involves consideration of past, continuing, planned and "further reasonable medical treatment". The applicant's condition must be "permanent" before it can be assigned a rating. A diagnosed "permanent" condition must also be "stabilised" in relation to any associated functional impairment before an impairment rating can be assigned. A condition is to be treated as "fully stabilised" if "significant functional improvement" is unlikely to occur within two years. These are mandatory requirements: see Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Parry [2007] FCA 1606 at [9] --- [11] (Finn J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 592">A DSP applicant's functional impairment rating must be determined under the Impairment Tables: s 94(1)(b). The Introduction to the Impairment Tables makes it clear that an applicant's condition must be a "fully documented, diagnosed condition which has been investigated, treated and stabilised" before the Impairment Tables can be applied to assign an impairment rating. Assessment that a condition has been fully treated involves consideration of past, continuing, planned and "further reasonable medical treatment". The applicant's condition must be "permanent" before it can be assigned a rating. A diagnosed "permanent" condition must also be "stabilised" in relation to any associated functional impairment before an impairment rating can be assigned.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] AATA 397">For the purposes of subs 94(1(b) of the SS Act, in order to qualify for a DSP a claimant's impairments must warrant a rating of 20 or more points applying the criteria set out in Schedule 1B of the SS Act. The preamble to the Schedule provides that an impairment, being a functional impairment, may only be assessed if it arises from a condition that has been fully documented, diagnosed, investigated, treated and stabilised. [8] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] AATA 228">There a number of "mandatory requirements" that must be considered and satisfied before any impairment rating can be assigned to a condition [2] . These are set out in paragraphs 4 to 6 of the Introduction to the Impairment Tables which, in so far as relevant, read: 
" Introduction 
 
...
 
4. A rating is only to be assigned after a comprehensive history and examination...
 
5. The condition must be considered to be permanent. Once a condition has been diagnosed, treated and stabilised, it is accepted as being permanent if in the light of available evidence it is more likely than not that it will persist for the foreseeable future ... A condition may be considered fully stabilised if it is unlikely that there will be any significant functional improvement, with or without reasonable treatment, within the next 2 years. 6. In order to assess whether a condition is fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised, one must consider: 
 what treatment or rehabilitation has occurred; whether treatment is still continuing or is planned in the near future; whether any further reasonable medical treatment is likely to lead to significant functional improvement within the next 2 years.. . "

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] AATA 1059">The second qualification criterion for DSP requires that Mr Perez Amaya's impairments warrant a rating of 20 or more point under the Impairment Tables set out at Schedule 1B of the Act. The preamble to those Tables provides that an impairment, being a functional impairment, may only be assessed if it arises from a condition that has been fully documented, diagnosed, investigated, treated and stabilised.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] AATA 944">Mr Curran first saw an endocrinologist in June 2007. Dr Gerstman considered the diabetes well controlled and did not find evidence of peripheral neuropathy on examination. Dr Gerstman advised Mr Curran regarding daily glucose monitoring and recommended consultation with a dietician. Mr Curran has acted on these recommendations. While Mr Curran's blood sugars on his evidence do fluctuate, this does not suggest that the condition is not permanent or that it is essentially unstable. As other tests have indicated, his diabetes is well controlled ( Secretary Department of Education and Workplace Relations v Hatton (2007) AATA 1631 Secretary Department of Education and Workplace Relations v Parry (2007) FCA 1606). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] AATA 315">The respondent referred me also to the introductory paragraphs of Schedule 1B. It is noted that a rating must be assigned only where the condition is fully documented, diagnosed, investigated, treated and stabilised [16] . But the condition must also be permanent, which has been taken to mean that on a balanced view of the evidence, "it is more likely than not that it will persist for the foreseeable future. This will be taken as lasting for more than two years" [17] . </sentence>
