<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1749">9 The present case is distinguishable from SZFOG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1170 , where misconduct on the part of a migration agent in respect of the filing of a notice of discontinuance was alleged, and from Applicant A26 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCA 1050 , where the notice was filed by the applicant's former solicitors without his consent. Here there was a knowing and voluntary election to discontinue because the applicant intended to seek an alternative visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 2116">16 Whether the Federal Magistrate was right to conclude that the appellant was prevented from raising these matters pursuant to the doctrine of res judicata may be put to one side: cf Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 242 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10 at [39] and MZWHU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1387 (" MZWHU ") and the authorities cited. On any view, the commencement of this proceeding by the appellant was and remains an abuse of process. The proceeding was doomed to fail. It is the latest in the history of repeated litigation over a period of approximately 
10 years during which the appellant has unsuccessfully sought to establish error in a decision of the delegate made on 9 October 1997. The appellant did not raise any matter which would permit him to reagitate issues already considered and determined against him by the Tribunal, the Federal Magistrates Court and the Federal Court: for example, see SBFF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 178 ; (2007) 158 FCR 49 at [23] ; MZWHU at [30] and [31]; SZFOG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1170 at [22] - [29]; SZATR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 986 at [16] - [18]; SYVB v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCA 1093 at [16] and by the Full Court in Chu Sing Wun v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 314 at 323 (per Carr and Sundberg JJ) and 346-347 (per Kiefel J).

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 2115">20 While the appellant asserted that the political climate in Sri Lanka had become more unstable, it is apparent that the current proceeding does not raise any issue that was not addressed in the earlier Federal Court proceedings by Heerey J. Whether the Federal Magistrate was right to conclude that the appellant was prevented from bringing the claim pursuant to the doctrines of res judicata and further or alternatively, issue estoppel may be put to one side: cf Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 242 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10 at [39] and MZWHU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1387 (" MZWHU ") and the authorities cited. On any view, the commencement of this proceeding by the appellant was and remains an abuse of process. The proceeding was doomed to fail. The appellant has not raised any matter which would permit him to reagitate issues already considered and determined against him by the Tribunal, the Federal Magistrates Court and the Federal Court: for example, see SBFF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 178 ; (2007) 158 FCR 49 at [23] ; MZWHU at [30] and [31]; SZFOG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1170 at [22] - [29]; SZATR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 986 at [16]- [18]; SYVB v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCA 1093 at [16] and by the Full Court in Chu Sing Wun v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 314 at 323 (per Carr and Sundberg JJ) and 346-347 (per Kiefel J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 687">19 The applicant submitted that he was unaware of the time limits for seeking judicial review of the Tribunal's decision and says that he relied upon his migration agent. The applicant, however, does not make a claim of procedural unfairness due to the conduct of his migration agent. The issue of default by a migration agent was considered in SZFOG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1170. The Court in that case noted the decision of Dowsett J in B41 of 2003, in the matter of an application for a Writ of Mandamus, Prohibition and Certiorari against Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 30. His Honour found that failures by a migration agent could not constitute a failure of the Tribunal in its obligation to afford an applicant procedural fairness. Numerous authorities were cited in support of this proposition: see NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184 ; SZEYH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Another [2006] FCA 93 ; (2006) 150 FCR 397 ; Al-Mehdawi v Secretary of State for the Home Departme nt [1990] 1 AC 876. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FMCA 1606">I distinguish this decision from that in SZFOG v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1170 where Cowdroy J, sitting on appeal, found that the fault of a migration agent could be taken into account in an application for dismissal on the grounds of abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FMCA 1514">In SZFOG v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1170 Cowdroy J collected a number of the authorities and confirmed that the principle enunciated by Dowsett J in B41 of 2002 [2004] FCA 30 , that the failures of a migration agent do not constitute grounds for alleging jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal, was clearly correct and supported by a number of other decisions, which he quotes, of the Federal Court.</sentence>
