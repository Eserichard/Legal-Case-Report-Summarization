<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 350">4 At the commencement of the hearing today, 5 March 2008, Mr Orlov alone appeared for the applicant. The Court was informed that Mr Crowe would not be available until 16 June 2008. No application was made to have the matter adjourned until his services could again be retained. Rather, an application was made to me as the trial Judge for leave to appeal from my judgment on the question of leave being granted to the applicant to cross-examine Mr Brendas by different counsel. The judgment has now been published and is identified as Canberra Residential Developments Pty Limited v Brendas (No 2) [2008] FCA 255. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 351">3 The sole basis upon which the application for leave to cross-examine by other counsel was made was that the applicant had no funds, or more accurately, the applicant's solicitors had no funds with which to pay senior counsel to appear. This morning an application was made for leave to appeal from the judgment of 4 March 2008 on that application ( Canberra Residential Developments Pty Limited v Brendas (No 2) [2008] FCA 255). That application was refused earlier this afternoon. </sentence>
