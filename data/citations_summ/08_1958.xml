<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1215">The first submission that was made is that the Registrar did not have jurisdiction to determine the application under s 440A(2). The applicant relied upon Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Scottsdale Homes No 3 Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1958 at [3] , where Logan J said: 
 
 Upon the winding-up application coming on before a registrar of the Court that day, an application was made for the winding up application to be adjourned, pursuant to s 440A(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). That particular application being beyond the jurisdictional remit of a registrar, the application was referred to a judge. It came before me for hearing today.
