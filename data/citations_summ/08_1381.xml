<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 489">However, Fairfax then resiled from its concession in oral argument that Form 167 was not part of an originating process within the meaning of O 46 r 6(2)(a). It contended that Allsop J had "appeared to accept that the Form 167 formed part of the originating process" in Thomson [2002] FCA 939 at [25] . Fairfax contended that proceedings under s 46PO of the Australian Human Rights Act and O 81 were sui generis and that their originating process consisted of a collocation of both Form 5 (being the form prescribed for an application in the Court's original jurisdiction) and Form 167. It argued that McKerracher J had "appeared to proceed" on a similar assumption in Reading [2008] FCA 1381 at [43] .  In response, the parties drew attention to an observation by Allsop J in Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 939 at [3] , [25] and [32] that Form 167 was not, and did not provide for, any pleading. That interpretation was adopted by McKerracher J in Reading v Partnership of Western Diagnostic Pathology [2008] FCA 1381 at [42] . Fairfax in its written submissions in reply abandoned its reliance on either Forms 167 or 168 being a "pleading". It was correct to have abandoned that contention.  I am of opinion that neither Form 167 nor Form 168 operates as a pleading. I agree with the conclusions and reasons of Allsop J in Thomson [2002] FCA 939 at [3] , [25] and [32] and McKerracher J in Reading [2008] FCA 1381 at [42] that Form 167 is not a pleading. I do not accept that in either judgment Allsop J or McKerracher J found or suggested that Form 167 was a pleading or part of the originating process. The application is the originating process, as each of O 4 r 1(1) and O 81 r 5(1) makes clear. A Form 167 must accompany an application pursuant to O 81 r 5(2)(a). The form itself is not an originating process or a pleading within the meaning of O 46 r 6(2)(a) or (c). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1409">The order meant that the applicant's claim was a pleading. The distinction between the requirements for a proper pleading and the requirements for a proper particularisation of a claim under Order 81 have been considered in the authorities (see, for example, Reading v Partnership of Western Diagnostic Pathology [2008] FCA 1381 at [42] per McKerracher J). Nothing turns on the distinction in this case because the deficiencies I will identify are deficiencies under either test. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1636">1 On 9 September 2008 judgment was given in Reading v Partnership of Western Diagnostic Pathology [2008] FCA 1381. As against the third and fourth respondents the application was dismissed. Other orders were made including leave to file and serve within 6 weeks, a fresh amended points of claim on certain terms. Certain issues were struck out. Submissions on costs of that application have now been received. 
  13 The ninth respondent has also sought dismissal. Although the substance of my reasons in Reading [2008] FCA 1381 would support such a submission, it is appropriate that there be a suitable motion for dismissal. If the matter can be dealt with by consent, that would be a saving of costs.
