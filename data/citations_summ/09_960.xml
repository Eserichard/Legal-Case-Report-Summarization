<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 382">In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 (" Allergy Pathway ") Finkelstein J had before him an application by the Commission for certain declarations to which the respondent consented. Actual evidence was placed before his Honour about the contravening conduct. His Honour nevertheless indicated that he would not have made the declarations without that evidence (at [10]) which suggests that his Honour was focussing on the principle in Wallersteiner v Moir , that declarations are not made without evidence, rather then the principle in Forster that they are not made without a contradictor. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 375">As a general principle, a Court does not make declarations on matters relating to public rights by consent or on admissions, unless it is satisfied by evidence: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 at [18] --- [19]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 710 at [13] ; Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Rich (No 2) [2004] NSWSC 836 ; (2004) 50 ACSR 500 at [10] ; Williams v Powell [1894] WN (Eng) 141; Gramophone Co Ltd v Magazine Holder Co (1911) 28 RPC 221 at 225-227; Termijtelen v Van Arkel [1974] 1 NSWLR 525 ; Wallersteiner v Moir [1974] 3 All ER 217 ; Metzger v Department of Health and Social Security [1977] 3 All ER 444 at 451; BMI Ltd v Federated Clerks Union of Australia (NSW) Branch (1983) 51 ALR 401 ; Young P W, Declaratory Orders (2nd ed, 1984) [601]. In the present case, that is not an issue. Fantastic Furniture has signed the Agreed Statement: see [3] and [4] above. That statement, to which s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) applies, is evidence. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 372">As a general principle, a Court does not make declarations on matters relating to public rights by consent or on admissions, unless it is satisfied by evidence: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 at [18] --- [19]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 710 at [13] ; Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Rich (No 2) [2004] NSWSC 836 ; (2004) 50 ACSR 500 at [10] ; Williams v Powell [1894] WN (Eng) 141; Gramophone Co Ltd v Magazine Holder Co (1911) 28 RPC 221 at 225-227; Termijtelen v Van Arkel [1974] 1 NSWLR 525 ; Wallersteiner v Moir [1974] 3 All ER 217 ; Metzger v Department of Health and Social Security [1977] 3 All ER 444 at 451; BMI Ltd v Federated Clerks Union of Australia (NSW) Branch (1983) 51 ALR 401 ; Young P W, Declaratory Orders (2nd ed, 1984) [601]. In the present case, that is not an issue. As noted earlier, Dimmeys signed the Agreed Statement: see [4] above. That statement, to which s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) applies, is evidence. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FCA 301">In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 , Finkelstein J considered whether a court might properly, by consent, make declarations in terms broadly similar to those sought in this case, on the basis of a statement of agreed facts. In the case before him, his Honour observed that initially the only evidence of contravention was a statement of agreed facts and if an expert medical report had not been subsequently tendered, he would not have made the declarations. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] FCA 74">It is likely that the respondents were aware, or at least did not care, that this video breached the undertaking. 
 

 
 
 (3) The contraventions of the TPA are serious. I highlighted the gravity of the situation in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 , [6]: 
 

 
 
 
 
 The impugned statements have the potential to cause real harm. Persons with allergies are best treated by medical practitioners. Further, clients suffering from allergies and taking the treatment provided by [Allergy Pathway] may wrongly believe the treatment is effective when it is not.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] VSC 515">I propose to only grant declarations where I am satisfied that the declarations sought are justified or supported. The fact that the parties consent to the making of the declarations or provide assurances by way of admission or agreed statement that asserted facts are true, is not enough. [7] I will make declarations on the basis of the facts as I find them. [8] 
43 The courts have consistently rejected arguments about the lack of utility of declaratory relief in cases involving the public interest. In ACCC Eurong Beach Resort Ltd, [9] Kiefel J had to deal with the issue of whether there is any utility in granting a bare declaration of past contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 856">The Court clearly has power to make such an order, under ss 80 and 86C(2) of the TP Act; see eg Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 682. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 760">In the 2009 decision, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 at [18] -[19] , Finkelstein J, citing BMI , made declarations in terms that had been submitted by consent by the parties. However, in doing so, his Honour stated: 
 
 The declaration cases, however, require proof by way of evidence. An assurance by parties (whether by admission or agreed statement) that asserted facts are true will not suffice. Moreover, the House of Lords did not think a departure from this rule was justified because of administrative expediency. 
 

 
 
 For the time being, at least until a Full Court holds otherwise, it is, in my view, incumbent upon a single judge of the Federal Court to follow BMI and therefore not grant a declaration involving a public right in the absence of evidence that supports the declaration. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FCA 759">In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 at [18] ---[19] , Finkelstein J, citing BMI Ltd, made declarations in terms that had been submitted by consent by the parties. However, in doing so, his Honour stated:

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] FCA 584">I need to make some comments about the evidence. Initially the parties tendered only the agreed statements of facts and admissions to justify the making of the orders. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 , I decided that, generally speaking, it was necessary before a declaration of contravention could be made that evidence had to be tendered that justified the relief. In reaching that decision I had not been referred to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 710 , which is to a different effect. There, Besanko J said that that s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) altered the common law in that evidence was no longer required to obtain a declaration affecting public rights. For reasons which I will now explain, I would not follow ACCC v Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd for it is, I think, plainly incorrect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] FCA 58">The only issue that might give pause is whether there is a proper contradictor in a case such as this where the parties have agreed as to the relevant facts, the conclusion that there has been a contravention of the EPBC Act and the appropriate penalty. In additional submissions made on behalf of the Minister, my attention was drawn to the judgment of Finkelstein J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960. That case concerned statements made by the respondent that the ACCC alleged were misleading. The statement concerned the respondent's capacity to diagnose and treat allergies. The ACCC tendered a report by Professor Douglass, an expert in allergy and respiratory medicine. Professor Douglass' report was a highly technical report that dealt with the nature of allergic diseases and allergic reactions, hypersensitivity, desensitisation and other treatment. In the light of Professor Douglass' report the respondent no longer disputed that it had contravened the Trade Practices Act . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCA 1579">While there is a well understood rule of practice that a Court should be slow to grant a declaration involving a public right in the absence of "evidence" that supports the declaration (as to which see BMI v Federated Clerks Union of Australia (1983) 51 ALR 401 at 413 - 414; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960 , Finkelstein J at [18] --- [19]), I am satisfied that on the material before the Court and in light of the statement of agreed facts to which the parties to this proceeding have subscribed and the Court has received, it is appropriate for the Court to make the declarations sought without requiring the taking of evidence in a more formal way. </sentence>
