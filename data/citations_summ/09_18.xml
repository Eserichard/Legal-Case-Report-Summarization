<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 46">In addition, his Honour discussed the recent decision of Quall v Northern Territory of Australia [2009] FCA 18 where an order similar to that sought was made by Reeves J: see [26]-[32]. That decision was upheld on appeal: Quall v Northern Territory of Australia [2009] FCAFC 157 ; (2009) 180 FCR 528 ( Quall FC ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 157">2 The consolidated proceeding (involving the 19 separation applications) was dismissed by Mansfield J in Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 ( Risk ). Mansfield J's decision related only to the land in Part A. The appellants then sought to pursue the claim in relation to land in Part B. On the application of the Northern Territory, the primary judge summarily dismissed the claim pursuant to O 20 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules on 19 January 2009; Quall v Northern Territory of Australia [2009] FCA 18. This is an appeal from the primary judge's decision.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] WAIRComm 1282">It is also clear from the authorities that the Anshun principle can apply to people who were not parties in the first action, although the circumstances in which this may occur might be rare ( Rogers v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 287; Quall v Northern Territory [2009] FCA 18 at [100] and Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231 at [83] ). This is relevant given that the applicant was not a party in Thompson v Reynolds . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1201">The summary judgment principles have been applied in the context of native title determinations on a number of occasions. In Moran v Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [1999] FCA 1637 Wilcox J dismissed proceedings for lack of authorisation (at [44]-[48]). In Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178 the Full Court (North, Dowsett and Lander JJ) (at [48]-[49] also on an authorisation basis); Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77 (at 88-89, at [50]-[51] where Stone J examined the Senate debate on the topic of summary judgment); Walker on behalf of The Noonukul of Minjerrabah v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 967 (at [17]-[18] again for lack of authorisation); and Van Hemmen on behalf of The Kabi Kabi People #3 v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 1185 (at [8] and, again, for lack of authorisation). Most recently in Quall v Northern Territory of Australia [2009] FCA 18 ( Quall) the claim was struck out for reasons which will be examined below in more detail but are directly pertinent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1200">Before considering the application of those principles in a number of cases, it is necessary to consider a recent similar case. In the recent decision of Quall [2009] FCA 18 , an order similar to that now sought was made by Reeves J. In Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 ( Risk ), parts of native title determination applications relating to a particular area near Darwin described as being 'Area A' had been consolidated into one set of proceedings. The second native title applicant in those proceedings, Mr Quall (on behalf of the Danggalaba and Kulumbiringin People), alleged the existence of a particular Aboriginal society that held native title. However, Mansfield J held, (as did Nicholson J in this case) that a different society to the one alleged by Mr Quall was the relevant society which held native title at sovereignty. His Honour held that society had ceased to hold native title due to a 'substantial interruption' in the observance of traditional laws and customs in the Twentieth Century. Claims over Area A were therefore dismissed.  Most recently in Quall v Northern Territory of Australia [2009] FCA 18 the claim was struck out for reasons which will be examined below in more detail but are presently pertinent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 783">The Minister relied on the analysis in Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (ACN 007 656 555) (No 6) [2004] FCA 1699 at [58] - [70] and Quall v Northern Territory of Australia [2009] FCA 18 at [100] - [102]. In the former, French J said at [66]: 
 The doctrines of res judicata , issue estoppel and Anshun do not exhaust the circumstances in which a proceeding may be regarded as amounting to an abuse of process by way of attempted re-litigation of a dispute already judicially determined. As another Full Court said in Coffey v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1999] FCA 375 ; (1999) 86 FCR 434 (at 443): 

 
 'An attempt to litigate in the Court a dispute or issue which has been resolved in earlier litigation in another court or tribunal may constitute an abuse of process even though the earlier proceeding did not give rise to a res judicata or issue estoppel: see Sea Culture International v Scoles [1991] FCA 523 ; [1991] FCA 523 ; (1991) 32 FCR 275 at 279 and Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393-394. Whether it does depends on the facts of the particular case. '
