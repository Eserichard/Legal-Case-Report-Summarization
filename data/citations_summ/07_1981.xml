<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VSC 524">20 I should also note that whilst Warren J held that the making of a vesting order in Re Purkiss was a step of last resort in that case, it was not necessary for her Honour to consider whether that was a prerequisite to the making of orders under s 103(1). Further, as Tracey J noted in Haslam v Money for Living (No. 2), her Honour did not hold that such a finding was a prerequisite to the vesting order she made under s 51 of the Trustee Act . [18] 
 
  16 Haslam v Money for Living (No. 2) [13] concerned a representative action in the Federal Court. A number of people had been induced to sell their homes and the proceedings had been commenced for orders setting aside the sales. Some of the applicants settled their claims and orders were sought so that effect could be given to the settlement.</sentence>
