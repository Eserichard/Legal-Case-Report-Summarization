<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 1168">41. There not having been a request under s.424 , the obligation envisaged by the second sentence of s.424(1) did not arise. See, for example, SZGPO v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 648 at [31] per Gilmour J. Again, no jurisdictional error is demonstrated.
