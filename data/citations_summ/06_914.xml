<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 806">It is also necessary to bear in mind that this Court has no jurisdiction on an appeal limited to a question of law, as this is, to evaluate the evidence before the Tribunal (see Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 at [7] per Branson J), nor does it have jurisdiction to review the merits of the Tribunal's decision: see Wu Shan Liang at 272. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 91">25 Hence, the "kind of death" in terms of ss 120A(2) and (4) is also one which refers to the medical cause or causes of death (see eg per Selway J in Hancock at [8]-[9]; per Gordon J in Codd at [36]-[39]; per Spender, Tamberlin and Kenny JJ in Fogarty v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCAFC 136 at [34] ; per Moore, Emmett and Allsop JJ in Benjamin at [53]-[54]; per Branson J in Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 at [22] - [33]; and per Tamberlin J in Repatriation Commission v Towns [2003] FCA 1262 ; (2003) 38 AAR 77 at 86-7). The decision about the "kind of death" is also not made by applying ss 120 or 120A or any Statement of Principles under s 196B(2) of the VE Act. It is made independently of them. Once it is made, then for the purpose of deciding whether the "kind of death" is war-caused, in accordance with the Deledio principles, those provisions and any relevant Statement of Principles are to be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCAFC 90">47 Hence, the "kind of death" in terms of ss 120A(2) and (4) is also one which refers to the medical cause or causes of death (see eg per Selway J in Hancock at [8]-[9]; per Gordon J in Codd at [36]-[39]; per Spender, Tamberlin and Kenny JJ in Fogarty v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCAFC 136 at [34] ; per Moore, Emmett and Allsop JJ in Benjamin v Repatriation Commission [2001] FCA 1879 ; (2001) 70 ALD 622 at [53] - [54]; per Branson J in Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 at [22] - [33]; and Per Tamberlin J in Repatriation Commission v Towns [2003] FCA 1262 ; (2003) 38 AAR 77 at 86-7).

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 345">Many decisions of this Court have emphasised the necessity to respect and comply with this requirement (see e.g. Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ("Etheridge") ; Purvis v Dairy Adjustment Authority (No 2) [2006] FCAFC 38 ; (2006) 150 FCR 48 ; Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 ("Brown") and Colby Corporation Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCAFC 10 ; (2008) 165 FCR 133 ( "Colby" )). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCAFC 188">77 The appeal faces a further difficulty. In a number of recent cases in this Court the jurisdictional limitation upon appeals under s 44 has been emphasised (see Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investment Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ('Etheridge') ; Purvis v Dairy Adjustment Authority (No 2) [2006] FCAFC 38 ; (2006) 150 FCR 48 ; Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 ('Brown') and Colby . Identification of a question of law is not only a fundamental prerequisite but, as many authorities confirm, a question of law so identified is the subject matter of the appeal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1858">12 In addition to this summary, the following principles, stated in various other decisions, are relevant to this decision: the jurisdiction of this Court is dependent upon a question of law being identified: Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 at [7] ; these requirements (above) are applied strictly: Lambe v Director-General of Social Services [1981] FCA 171 ; (1981) 4 ALD 362 at 264 and Bishop v Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1118 at [5] ; on an appeal of this kind, this Court should proceed with restraint and not inflate questions of fact into questions of law: Blackwood Hodge (Aust) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) [No 2] [1980] FCA 96 ; (1980) 3 ALD 38 at 50, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift [1989] FCA 413 ; (1989) 18 ALD 679 at 693 and Politis v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 16 ALD 707 at 708; and the reasons of the Tribunal should not be read over zealously, or with a keen eye for error: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Laing [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 and 291.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 236">99 Justice Branson pointed out at [27] and [30] in Etheridge that judicial review under s 5(1) of the ADJR Act is also available for Tribunal decisions under the SRC Act where such an application is made. In Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 Branson J referred at [8] to the fact that the ADJR Act provided an alternative source of jurisdiction to the AAT Act. In Barry Branson J made orders under s 5 of the ADJR Act for errors of law when it was not clear that the Court's jurisdiction under s 44(1) of the AAT Act was properly invoked. Mr Sellick argues that her Honour's comments in Etheridge and Brown are obiter and that Ms Barry was unrepresented so that no submissions on jurisdiction under the ADJR Act were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FMCAfam 712">33. Thus, of relevance to s.110B appeals in my view are cases on s.44 appeals in relation to: 
 
 
 &#8226; what is a "question of law" (for example, Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 456; [1993] FCA 456 ; (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287; Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd (1996) 196 CLR 389 at 394-399; Repatriation Commission v Hill [2002] FCAFC 192 at [59] , [2002] FCAFC 192 ; (2002) 69 ALD 581 ; Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 at [6] --- [8], [2003] FCAFC 143 ; (2003) 131 FCR 28 , 37 AAR 309) ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 at [45] and [46] per Branson J, [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 202 ALR 450 , 47 ACSR 649 ; Hartnett v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2004] FCA 50 at [50] )
 &#8226; the centrality to the appeal on a question of law and its impact on the nature of the proceedings (for example, Birdseye above at [10] to [22] per Branson and Stone JJ [2003] FCAFC 232 ; , (2003) 76 ALD 321 , 38 AAR 55: Saxby Bridge , above, at [107] per Jacobsen and Bennett JJ; Comcare v Etheridge above at [13] and [14] per Branson J, with whom Spender and Nicholson JJ agreed; Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 at [7] );
 &#8226; the necessary connection between the question of law raised on an appeal and the relief sought (for example, Birdseye , above, at [18] per Branson and Stone JJ; Saxby Bridge , above, at [47] per Branson J).

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCA 877">42 Despite the respondent's submissions to the contrary, the decision of Tamberlin J in Repatriation Commission v Towns [2003] FCA 1262 ; (2003) 38 AAR 77 does not assist the respondent's case. The decision must be understood having regard to the matters that were in issue in the case. In Towns , there was consensus that there was no relevant SoP and so it was unnecessary to make any analysis of the kind of death met by the veteran: at [28]. It would be wrong, then, to take what was said in that case as supporting or establishing the general proposition that the expression " kind of death " was not concerned with medical causation where the medical cause or causes can be identified. Likewise, the decision of Branson J in Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 makes plain that the decision in that case was not the occasion to provide general and definitive guidance about the meaning of the expression.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] NFSC 6">There is a distinction between an appeal "on a question of law", as required by s 34(1) of the Administrative Review Tribunal Act , and an appeal that merely involves a question of law. The former is a narrower expression. It involves what has been described as "a pure question of law". A mixed question of fact and law is not a question of law within the meaning of s 34(1). See generally Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at [16] . See also Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at [47] ---[48] per Branson J, and at [107]---[108] per Jacobson and Bennett JJ; and Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 at [7] per Branson J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FCA 947">25 Finally in Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 , Branson J said at [7]:
 
 ...The Court has no jurisdiction on such an appeal to evaluate the evidence before the Tribunal. Order 53 r 3(2) of the Federal Court Rules (and see also Form 55A) requires the notice of appeal to state separately the question or questions of law to be raised on the appeal, the order sought and the grounds relied upon in support of the order sought. This final requirement calls for a brief statement explaining why the answer to the question (or questions) of law will lead to the making of the order sought. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2006] AATA 974">He said he relied on Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 and Parkes v Repatriation Commission [2003] AATA 818 , both of which considered the term operative cause of death.</sentence>
