<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 493">Lanepoint was subject to a presumption of insolvency when receivers were appointed to it pursuant to a floating charge: s 459C(2)(c) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act"). Australian Securities and Investment Commission ("ASIC") has applied to wind up Lanepoint on the basis of this presumption. This discharges ASIC's obligation to demonstrate a prima facie case that Lanepoint is insolvent and therefore meets the condition for the grant of leave under s 459P(3) of the Act: ASIC v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (No 3 ) [2006] FCA 1710 at [53] and ASIC v Eastlands Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1702 at [64] . </sentence>

The jurisdiction of this Court to wind up companies is conferred by the Corporations Act s 459A and s 459B. ASIC has standing to make the applications under the Act s 459P and s 464.</sentence>
