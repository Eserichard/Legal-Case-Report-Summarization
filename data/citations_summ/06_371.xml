<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 638">In Rio Tinto , the Court also noted that whilst the majority in Telstra Corporation v B T Australasia highlighted the conduct of the privilege holder, its references to fairness as the governing principle was misplaced having regard to the observations in Mann v Carnell . In DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc and Anor [2003] FCA 384 ; (2003) 127 FCR 499 , Allsop J observed that the isolation of the principle of inconsistency of conduct in Mann v Carnell rather than an "overriding principle of fairness operating at large" ( Mann v Carnell at [29]) represented a rejection of the statement of principle in Telstra Corporation v B T Australia and represented "an important change to the existing law": DSE (Holdings) v Intertan Inc at [14].

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] SASC 228">On this application, I was taken to the case of Australian Agricultural Company Ltd v AMP Life Ltd . [3] I was not referred to that authority in Elders Forestry Ltd v BOSI Security Services Ltd and Others (No 2). The substantive proceedings in that case related to the sale by tender of shares of a company which was conducted by the respondent, AMP. During the tender process, AMP retained Rabo to advise it in respect of financial issues relating to the sale. The advices provided by Rabo to AMP contained a detailed review of the offers and of various considerations which Rabo considered pertinent to AMP's deliberations. The applicant, AACo, made a tender for the shares which was rejected by AMP in favour of a rival tender. In the course of advising AMP, Rabo was privy to legal advice provided to AMP by its solicitor, Clayton Utz. AACo sought orders that AMP produce for inspection documents held by Rabo in respect of which AMP claimed legal professional privilege. AACo claimed that AMP had waived legal professional privilege in respect of the documents by its conduct of the proceedings.  Rather, AMP has pleaded its belief with respect to the best commercial option which was open to it, a belief informed primarily by commercial advice from Rabo. In these circumstances I do not consider that AMP's pleadings are inconsistent with the maintenance of its legal professional privilege. [5] (emphasis in original)

 PROCEDURE - DISCOVERY AND INTERROGATORIES - DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION OF DOCUMENTS - PRODUCTION AND INSPECTION - GROUNDS FOR RESISTING PRODUCTION - LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE - WAIVER OF PRIVILEGE 
 
Application by defendants for disclosure of documents over which legal professional privilege claimed --- whether plaintiff's pleading implicates legal advice it received to extent necessary to waive privilege. Held: Application dismissed. Australian Agricultural Company Ltd v AMP Life Ltd [2006] FCA 371 , discussed.

 Civil: Application 
 
 KOURAKIS J : This was an interlocutory application for disclosure of documents over which legal professional privilege was claimed. AACo relies upon Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1995) 37 NSWLR 405 at 411; Telstra Corporation Ltd &amp; Anor v BT Australasia Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (1998) 85 FCR 152 at 166-7; Fort Dodge Australia Pty Ltd v Nature Vet Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 501 at [11]; BP Australia Pty Ltd v Nyran Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1302 at [17] ; Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1336 at [40] ---[42]. [13] AACo submits that the majority judgment in Telstra Corporation remains good law and relies upon Perpetual Trustees (WA) Ltd v Equuscorp Pty Limited [1999] FCA 925 at [16] and DSE Holdings Pty Limited v Intertan Inc &amp; Anor [2003] FCA 384.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] QCA 265">[25] The same approach was adopted in Bank of Nova Scotia v Hellenic Mutual War Risks Association (Bermuda) Ltd (The Good Luck) [26] and Australian Hospital Care (Pindara) Pty Ltd v Duggan, [27] which Neave JA cited in Spotless, [28] and in a decision cited by the Council in this appeal, Australian Agricultural Co Ltd v AMP Life Ltd. [29] 
[28] In my respectful opinion, those decisions give effect to the underlying purposes of the doctrine of legal professional privilege which, so far as it protects the confidentiality of legal advice, include encouraging clients to obtain legal advice for the purpose of using it "in the conduct of his or her affairs".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FamCA 420">47. In relying on Mann v Carnell (supra), counsel for the husband had referred to a number of other cases in relation to the question of state of mind. Privilege can be waived if a party's state of mind or knowledge is an issue and legal advice was relevant to the formulation of the state of mind (Subs para 7). Reference was made to Australian Agricultural Co Ltd &amp; AMP Life Ltd [2006] FCA 371. It is also correct that the wife " has not made any assertions as to the content of legal advice given to her and nor has she stated that her decision to enter into the consent property orders was based upon legal advice.

 1 The applicant before the Court is Macquarie Bank Limited. It is the applicant in proceedings for an order under section 79A of the Act directed against Consent Orders made in this Court on the 25 th of August 2004.  
 
 
 
 37 In Australian Agricultural Company Limited v AMP Life Limited [2006] FCA 371 (Cowdroy J) Cowdroy J was concerned with whether the respondent had waived legal professional privilege by its conduct of the proceedings to date. Cowdroy J set out key passages from Mann v Carnell and Telstra v BT and then agreed with the position of Allsop J in DSE Holdings on the effect of Mann v Carnell on the ratio of Telstra v BT : 


 
 
 "28 The effect of Mann v Carnell upon the ratio in Telstra was considered by Allsop J in DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc, where his Honour said (at 501-502 [4]-[5]): 
 
 
 
 
 
 'I have come to the view that the authorities in this Court may require me to be guided by what the majority of the Full Court said in Telstra Corporation Ltd v BT Australasia Pty Ltd (1998) 85 FCR 152 , as necessarily modified by Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at 12 [27] and 13 [29] ... 
 My own view is that Mann v Carnell evinces more than a modification of the approach of the majority in Telstra and amounts to a rejection of that approach and that the notion of inconsistency of conduct by the holder of the privilege and the maintenance of the confidence in question (though informed where relevant by notions of fairness) works a narrower and more confined operation for implied waiver than as expressed by the majority in Telstra. ' 
 
 


 
 
 29 I respectfully agree with his Honour with respect to the effect of Mann v Carnell. To the extent that Telstra suggests that fairness is the overriding consideration, it should not be followed. It is clear that following Mann v Carnell, inconsistency of conduct should be the guiding principle in determining whether legal professional privilege has been waived, although fairness remains an element for consideration in determining whether conduct is inconsistent.
