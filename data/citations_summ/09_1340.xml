<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 314">One possible answer to this is that the applicant's action in seeking Ministerial intervention displayed a contrary intention to seeking judicial review and, on balance and in the circumstances, cannot be taken to establish a satisfactory explanation for the periods covered by these requests (see Vu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 59 ; (2008) 101 ALD 211 per Jessup J (Gyles and Besanko JJ agreeing) at [29]; Applicant A2 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 576 at [9] ; Batuwantudawa, in the matter of an application for Writs of Certiorari &amp; Prohibition against Ruddock [2003] FCA 684 Gray J at [9]; Re Ruddock; Ex Parte LX [2003] FCA 561 at [42] per Heerey J; Applicant M29 of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1266 ; Applicant VUAD of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1331 at [18] - [20] per Weinberg J (see also Applicant VUAD of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 186) ; Daniel v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 21 ; (2004) 205 ALR 198 ; M211 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCAFC 293 ; (2004) 212 ALR 520 ; SZJYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 135 ; SZGZW v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 457 ; SZGPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 683.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 436">The appeal before me was lodged about 11 months out of time. However, on 20 November 2009, Jagot J of this Court granted the appellant an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal: see SMZKK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1340. Notwithstanding the delay, her Honour considered that it was in the interests of the administration of justice that such an extension of time be granted. This was because, in particular, the appellant had in the intervening period been awaiting a Ministerial decision under s 417 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (Act) by way of substitution for the decision made by the Tribunal, having regard to the public interest, which application the appellant understood had a real chance of success. Her Honour also regarded the proposed grounds of appeal. </sentence>
