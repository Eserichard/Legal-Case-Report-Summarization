42 The same complaints have been put and rejected on three previous occasions by judges of this Court. Justice Merkel rejected the argument: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 2) [2006] FCA 336. Justice Tracey first rejected the argument in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 4) [2006] FCA 1339. He rejected the argument for the second time at the trial of this matter. 43 The appellant sought leave to appeal from orders made by Tracey J in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 4) [2006] FCA 1339 but leave was refused by Weinberg J: Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2006] FCA 1398. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1398">Tracey J ordered that Mr Siminton's application be dismissed with costs on 6 October 2006. His Honour gave reasons for that decision in the form of a "ruling" delivered on that same day: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v David Robert Siminton (No 4) [2006] FCA 1339. He noted that a number of the matters raised by Mr Siminton had been agitated before another judge of this Court, Merkel J, earlier this year: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 2) [2006] FCA 336. However, Tracey J also noted that Mr Siminton had raised what his Honour described as a "novel complaint", namely that the proceeding had been brought unconstitutionally because it was said to provide for the acquisition of Mr Siminton's property by APRA, or the Commonwealth, without just terms. </sentence>
