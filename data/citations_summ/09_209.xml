<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 128">There have been some differences of opinion in the Federal Court whether reliance upon information given by a witness to the Tribunal may become subject to obligations under s.424A(1). So far as I am aware, the most recent decision, which is for that reason binding on me, holds that those obligations do arise (see the judgment of Rares J in SZEWL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 209 ; (2009) 174 FCR 498 at [44] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1135">At this point it is useful to consider what amounts to "information" for the purposes of s.359A. The nature of "information" was discussed by Rares J in SZEWL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 209 in the context of s.424A , the Refugee Review Tribunal's equivalent of s.359A. In that case, his Honour said: In SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at 259 [205] , Allsop J said: "Information is that of which one is told or apprised; it is knowledge communicated concerning some particular fact, subject or event: the Complete Oxford English Dictionary (2 nd ed, 1991). " And, in SZBYR 235 ALR at 616 [18], the plurality said: "However broadly 'information' be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation , not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies, or the absence of evidence. " (emphasis added) In my opinion, "information" within the meaning of s 424A must relate to what a witness said to the tribunal, or what is contained in documentation before the tribunal. Such a construction is reinforced by consideration of s 424. That section entitles the tribunal to get any information that it considers relevant. And, 
 s 424(2) authorises the tribunal to invite a person "to give additional information". ... (at [46]-[47]) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 778">The applicant did allege that he misunderstood what the Tribunal meant when it said "follow" in the passage quoted above. However, he did not point to any part of Dr. Brown's evidence which he had failed to understand nor to the significance of any such lack of understanding, had there been any. In any event, Dr. Brown's evidence was not evidence given to the Tribunal by the applicant for the purposes of the review: SZEWL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 209. Consequently, the relevant right which the applicant had was to be notified pursuant to s.424A of any information adverse to his claim which may have been contained in the evidence given by Dr. Brown. He has not alleged that there was any such information. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 198">The applicant filed supplementary submissions on 31 March 2009 which are relevantly as follows: ... It follows from SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 228 CLR 294 that the Tribunal is obliged to comply with section 357A(1) in respect of "information" given by a witness to the Tribunal. In SAAP , the Tribunal erred by failing to give an applicant written notice of oral evidence given by her daughter, in circumstances where the daughter had been called as a witness. ... Further, it follows from SZEWL v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 209 that this applies whether or not the witness had been called at the request of the Applicant. This is because "on the proper construction of the Act, information given orally by a witness, other than the Applicant for review, cannot be " information" that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application for review within the meaning of the exception of s 424A(3)(b) " (per Rares J at [44]). The Minister suggests that there is a distinction to be drawn between oral evidence and documents , because of the degree of certainty associated with documents as opposed to oral evidence (paragraph 10 of the Minister's Supplementary Submissions). At the trial of this matter I invited additional written submissions from the parties on the impact of the decision of his Honour Rares J in SZEWL v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 209 and also whether, because the review applicant and the visa applicants were different people, additional issues arise from the decision of the High Court in SZBEL. The Minister filed supplementary submissions on 25 March 2009 which relevantly state: In SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 228 CLR 294 McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ held that the Tribunal breached section 424A(1) by failing to give a review applicant written notice of oral evidence given by her daughter, where the daughter had been called as a witness by the Tribunal of its own motion. In SZEWL (supra), the Tribunal used the evidence the review applicant's alleged de facto (referred to in the judgment as "Ms L") relating to her inquiries and her failure to tell the review applicant of them, as a basis for its rejection of his claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 509">The essence of the applicants' case is that information contained in a document given to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review is not information falling within s.424A(3)(b) if that information is not contained in a communication directly from the applicants but, rather, is a report of something they have said. That argument misconstrues the nature of "information" as the term is understood for the purposes of s.424A. The nature of such information was discussed by Rares J in SZEWL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 209 where his Honour said: In SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at 259 [205] , Allsop J said: "Information is that of which one is told or apprised; it is knowledge communicated concerning some particular fact, subject or event: the Complete Oxford English Dictionary (2 nd ed, 1991).

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 504">When the matter was first before the Court the applicant made submissions in relation to her claims and counsel for the first respondent addressed some aspects of those claims. It became apparent that there was an issue about the application of s.424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) to the evidence given by the two witnesses in the second hearing at the request of the applicant in light of the decision of the Federal Court in SZEWL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 209. The hearing was adjourned so that this matter could be addressed by each of the parties. Further written submissions were provided by each of the parties and the matter was addressed in oral submissions by counsel for the respondent today. The applicant was also given an opportunity to respond to any of the submissions made for the respondent but, in essence, confined herself to relying on her written submissions and taking issue with the decision of the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 413">While not raised by the applicant, counsel for the Minister addressed the possibility that s.424A(1) applied to the evidence of the witness at the Tribunal hearing. At the request of the applicant, the Tribunal heard evidence from a named witness. Such evidence is not within s.424A(3)(b). It is not information given by the applicant for the purpose of the application for review (see SZEWL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 209 per Rares J). </sentence>
