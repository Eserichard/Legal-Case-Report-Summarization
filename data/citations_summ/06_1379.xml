<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 654">In any event, the question of whether Prestige is properly characterised as a demise charterer of the ship is largely irrelevant. Mr Pantaloni is the nominated relevant person. He has never been a charterer or demise charterer of the ship and even if "holding over" gives rise to a continuing time charter on the same terms and conditions as that which expired by 9 January 2009, the holding over must be taken to be that of Prestige. Although there is authority that a demise charter does not subsist after termination of the charter party by the owner ( CMC (Australia) Pty Ltd v Ship "Socofl Stream" [1999] FCA 1419 ; (1999) 95 FCR 403 at 419 [28] per Moore J, a contrary view has been expressed by Finkelstein J in ASP Holdings v Pan Australia Shipping [2006] FCA 1379 ; (2006) 235 ALR 554 at 558 [14] and [15]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 690">I have been confirmed in that conclusion by another decision of this Court in ASP Holdings Ltd v Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1379 ; (2006) 235 ALR 554. There, Finkelstein J set out his own view of the ingredients of an effective notice under cl 28. Several relevant principles can be distilled from his Honour's reasons.</sentence>
