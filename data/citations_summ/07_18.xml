<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 977"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 375">For the reasons explained earlier, I do not agree with her Honour's construction of the section. However, I agree with her Honour (at [21]) that Uddin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 841 and Shao v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 18 ; (2007) 157 FCR 300 were decided in a statutory context so different to the present that these cases are of no assistance in the resolution of this case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 92">Mr Chan, appearing for the Applicant, acknowledges and concedes that there has been a cancellation by operation of s.137J of the Act and there has not been an exercise of an administrative decision. Accordingly both parties accept that this Court does not have jurisdiction under s.476(1) of the Act to review the cancellation of the Student visa because it does not constitute a migration decision within the meaning of ss.5 &amp; 474 of the Act.. The cancellation of the visa occurred by operation of s.137J itself and nothing needed to be done by the Minister or his delegate or any other party to effect that cancelation: Shao v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 18 ; (2007) 157 FCR 300 per Lander J at [9] where His Honour stated [9] It is the subsection itself which cancels the non-citizen's visa. Nothing needs to be done by the Minister or any other party to effectuate the cancellation of the non-citizen's visa. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1124">Insofar as potentially relevant it deals with s 137J(1) which concerns a different issue (revocation of a visa) and different requirements (including to attend before an officer as defined). In Uddin Scarlett FM held that these notice requirements had to be complied with strictly. The statutory circumstances in Uddin (and the cases referring to it, Morsed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 88 ALD 90 ; [2005] FCAFC 193 and Shao v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2007) 157 FCR 300 ; [2007] FCA 18) not are not sufficiently similar to s 66(2)(d)(iv) to support any form of reasoning by analogy. Section 66(2)(d)(iv) does not say that the notice must identify all places where an application for review can be made. It states only that the notice must state "where the application for review can be made". The applicants in the instant case take from these decisions a requirement for the delegate to clearly state the addresses of all places at which an application for review of the decision can be made. The applicants argue that this is consistent with the mandatory wording of s.66. The applicants argue that their views are supported by those expressed by Scarlett FM in Uddin v Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 841 which the Minister has conceded to be correct in several cases including Morsed v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCAFC 193 ; [2005] 88 ALD 90 and Shao v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 18 ; [2007] 157 FCR 300. In that case a notice of cancellation sent pursuant to s.20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 ("ESOS") was held to be invalid because the notice did not accurately set out the effects of s.137J and 137K by advising the applicant that he had to report to an officer at the Melbourne office of the Department whereas in fact he could attend any office of the Department. (emphasis added) </sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 945">14 The decision of Lander J referred to is his Honour's judgment in Shao v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 18 ; (2007) 157 FCR 300 , in which his Honour rejected, at [55], the contention that:
 ... any administrative decision of any kind is made when 137J applies by reason of a notice having been given under section 20 of the ESOS Act to a non-citizen. There is no administrative decision to be made. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FMCA 2147">The operation of these provisions has been the subject of many decisions, including the recent judgment of Lander J in Shao v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 18 ; (2007) 157 FCR 300. At [55] Lander J clearly rejected the contention that "any administrative decision of any kind is made when s 137J applies by reason of a notice having been given under s 20 of the ESOS Act to a non-citizen. There is no administrative decision to be made" .

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FMCA 100">In Shao v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 18 Lander J considered the decision of Uddin and concluded that where a s.20 notice is invalid the visa subject to the notice cannot be cancelled under s.137J.</sentence>
