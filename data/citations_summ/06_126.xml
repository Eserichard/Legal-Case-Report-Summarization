<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] HCA 3">The appeals are brought to this Court from the decisions of the Full Court of the Federal Court reported as Selim v Lele [2] . The Full Court (Black CJ, Finn and Lander JJ) dismissed an appeal by Dr Selim from the decision of Stone J [3] , and answered adversely to Dr Wong questions referred to the Full Court in a proceeding which had been instituted by him in this Court and remitted by order of Gleeson CJ to the Federal Court. 
  KIRBY J. Dr Chee Kan Kenneth Wong and Dr Ashraf Thabit Selim ("the appellants") challenge orders of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia [70] . That Court by those orders (in consolidated proceedings) dismissed an appeal by Dr Selim from orders of a single judge (Stone J) [71] and decided a reference to the Federal Court from this Court of like questions adversely to Dr Wong [72] . 
  Dr Selim's application was heard by a single judge of the Federal Court (Stone J) and in February 2006 the application was dismissed [179] . Dr Selim appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 987">47 There was no argument advanced at the hearing in support of this ground of challenge. Dr Saint said that there were two cases which were then pending on appeal before the Full Court which had raised the same grounds of challenge as relied on by Dr Saint. These cases were Selim v Lele [2006] FCA 126 ; (2006) 150 FCR 83 and Dimian and Wong v The Commonwealth of Australia , an application which was remitted to the Federal Court by the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 13">1 There are two matters before the Court. The first is an appeal from a decision of a single judge of the Court in Selim v Lele and Ors [2006] FCA 126 ; (2006) 150 FCR 83. The second is a reference of questions to a Full Court in the matter of Dimian and Wong v The Commonwealth of Australia which is an application remitted to the Federal Court by the High Court of Australia. We heard both matters together. The Attorney-General for the Commonwealth intervened in Selim [2006] FCA 126 ; (2006) 150 FCR 83 and the respondents in that case adopted his submissions.  11 The following questions were referred to the Full Court in Dimian &amp; Anor v Commonwealth of Australia : 
 
 
 1. Whether ss 10, 20, 20A and Part VAA (or any provision of Part VAA) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) amount to "civil conscription" within the meaning of s 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution , and are outside the legislative power of the Commonwealth. 2. Whether, contrary to s 71 of the Constitution , s 106U of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) purports to confer part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth on persons who have not been appointed pursuant to s 72 of the Constitution , and is invalid. 
 

 Sections 10 and 20 of the Act set out who is eligible to receive Medicare benefits, the circumstances under which they are entitled to a benefit and the amount to be paid (by reference to Schedule fees). Section 20A allows for the assignment of Medicare benefits, establishing the "bulk billing" scheme by which benefits may be paid directly to a medical practitioner if they accept the benefit as full payment for the service provided. The same questions arise for determination in the appeal in Selim [2006] FCA 126 ; (2006) 150 FCR 83. 
  3 The doctors contend that the PSR Scheme and certain other key provisions of the Act offend the prohibition on civil conscription in s 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution and that the Act impermissibly confers the judicial power of the Commonwealth on the Determining Authority. These contentions were rejected by the learned primary judge in Selim [2006] FCA 126 ; (2006) 150 FCR 83. 
  6 As the learned primary judge in Selim [2006] FCA 126 ; (2006) 150 FCR 83 noted, the Report of the Review Committee of the Professional Services Review Scheme (Commonwealth, 1999) (the Report) identified various categories of conduct as involving inappropriate practice. What the Committee described as general professional issues included clinical competence and performance and aberrant professional behaviour and beliefs. It also identified particular types of professional conduct such as: high number of services per patient; unusual incidence of specific types of services; inappropriate prescribing; inappropriate ordering of diagnostic and imaging pathology; inappropriate use of Medicare item numbers when making claims. It noted that a large number of the cases brought before PSR Committees involved general practitioners providing high numbers of services per day with low rates of consultation services per patient: see Selim [2006] FCA 126 ; (2006) 150 FCR 83 at 90 and pp 15 to 16 of the Report. 1 There are two matters before the Court.
