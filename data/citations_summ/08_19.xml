<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] AATA 579">The provisions of s 67 of the SRC Act are a code in the area of costs. [14] Even though the only provision of that section that is immediately relevant in the present case is subs 67(8A), it is desirable to consider that provision in the context of the section as a whole. The general rule is set out in subs 67(1): each party to a proceeding shall bear their own costs. Subs 67(2) to (12) set out the circumstances in which the general rule may not apply. [15] Subs 67(2) renders a responsible authority (as defined at subs 67(1A)) liable to reimburse a claimant for costs reasonably incurred in a proceeding that is rendered abortive in circumstances that are not presently relevant; if the particular circumstances are established, the liability to pay flows as a function of the subsection, without a determination by the Tribunal. Subs 67(3) to (7) inclusive concern the making of declarations in reference to subs 67(2) that are also not presently relevant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] AATA 1124">In the recent decision of Griffiths v Australian Postal Corporation [2008] FCA 19 , the general principles to apply in considering costs applications under the SRC Act were reviewed by the Federal Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] AATA 912">That the letter went further and referred to claims pursuant to sections 16 and 19 SRC Act does not constitute the offer an invalid one. This point was expressly determined by Madgwick J in Griffiths v Australian Postal Corporation [2008] FCA 19 . </sentence>
