<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 309">3 In Nokia Corporation v Cellular Line Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 980 , delivered on 11 August 2006, the Court ordered that 60% of the applicant's costs be paid by the first and second respondents, 20% be paid by the third respondent, and 20% be paid by the fourth respondent (less 20% of costs referable to the applicant's costs of preparing evidence of sales of counterfeit products after 24 February 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] VCAT 335">16 The architectural draftsman and the building surveyor submitted that any costs that were ordered against them should be apportioned under Part IVAA in the same proportions as the liability apportioned against them in the substantive hearing bears to the total sum of damages ordered in the substantive hearing. Their submission is based on the following premises:- 

(a) 'loss and damage' referred to in Part IVAA includes costs: see Aquatech-Maxcon Pty Ltd v Barwon Regional Water Authority and Others (No. 3) [2006] VSC 270 at para [21] (architectural draftsman);
 
(b) the proportion of liability compared to the total liability found represents the upper limit of costs to be borne by the respondents as concurrent wrongdoers under Part IVAA (architectural draftsman);
 
(c) to do otherwise would be to subvert the legislative intent of Part IVAA (building surveyor); and
 
(d) there are examples of costs being apportioned to specific respondents: Nokia Corporation v Cellular Line Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2006] FCA 980 (building surveyor).</sentence>
