Similar orders have been made in other proceedings commenced by the ACCC and resolved by consent ( ACCC v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1976 ; ACCC v British Airways plc [2008] FCA 1977 ; ACCC v Oobi Baby Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1488 ; April (No 5 )). The Parties submit that it is appropriate for an order that APP Singapore and Indah Kiat pay the amount of $300,000 in respect of the ACCC's costs of and incidental to this proceeding as against them.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 510">In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v British Airways PLC [2008] FCA 1977 at [20], Lindgren J adopted the remarks he had earlier expressed in ACCC v Qantas. However, this observation is also to be read in light of admissions made by British Airways in that case. It does not, in my view, amount to a statement of general principle which is sufficient to support the present pleading. </sentence>
