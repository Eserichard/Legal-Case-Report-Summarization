On 16 February 2007, however, Finn J, pursuant to O 35 r 7(1) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth), set aside his judgment in Wiegand v Comcare Australia [2006] FCA 1620 , allowed Mr Wiegand's appeal, set aside the Tribunal's decision of 12 August 2005, and remitted the matter to the Tribunal "to be decided again": see Wiegand v Comcare (No 2) [2007] FCA 237 ; (2007) 94 ALD 154.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 38">Unlike other cases in which distinct operative causes occurred at different times, the causes in this case are inextricably linked and their impact occurred simultaneously. [29] Accordingly, it is artificial to attempt to separate out the content of the allegations from the actions of ACT Health in accepting the claims and taking action on them. As Martin CJ noted in Swanson v Northern Territory [30] , in a matter on comparable facts that applied legislation based on the Commonwealth Act: 
 
 No doubt the fact of the allegations [by some of Mr Swanson's pupils] operated on the mind of the appellant and could be regarded as a "cause" of his injury. However, the summoning [of Mr Swanson by the principal] and imparting of the information was also a cause and the injury was "a result of" that reasonable administrative action. The effect or consequence of the summoning and imparting of the information was the suffering of the injury. [31]

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] AATA 1111">See Hart v Comcare [2005] FCAFC 16 ; Treloar v the Australian Telecommunications Commission [1990] FCA 511 ; (1990) 97 ALR 321 , Weigand v Comcare Australia [2006] FCA 1620 , Trewin v Comcare (1998) 84 FCR 171. In addition, the recent judgment of Finn J in Weigand v Comcare Australia [2006] FCA 1620 reinforces the position that, where a combination of employment related situations and events and other situations or events may lead to a psychiatric condition, this combination may not give rise to compensation in all cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 237">1 On 27 November 2006 I gave judgment in this matter in which I dismissed an appeal brought by Mr Wiegand under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth): Wiegand v Comcare Australia [2006] FCA 1620. His application related to an unsuccessful claim for compensation under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth). In the following week I caused Comcare to be called on not to enter judgment. I then foreshadowed the possibility that I would exercise my power to set aside my judgment, then allow Mr Wiegand's application, set aside the Tribunal decision in question and remit the matter to the Tribunal to be reheard and determined: see O 35 r 7(1) of the Federal Court Rules . </sentence>
