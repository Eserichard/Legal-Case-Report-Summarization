<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 950">In Rich v Harrington [2007] FCA 1987 , 245 ALR 106 ( Rich ) Ms Rich, a partner in the legal and accounting firm of Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC), who had commenced proceedings against the partners alleging direct and indirect sex discrimination and victimisation, challenged the respondents' claim of legal professional privilege in respect of certain categories of document. One category was legal advice from lawyers in PwC's own Office of General Counsel (OGC), which Ms Rich challenged on the basis that the relationship between the respondents and the OGC was not such as to give rise to the privilege. As Branson J understood it, Ms Rich submitted, first, that the independence of legal advice provided by the OGC could not rise above the independence of the person who holds the office of General Counsel because that person supervised and had ultimate responsibility for the work of the OGC; and second, that the OGC's legal advice was not independent because General Counsel, who was also a partner in PwC, had been both legal adviser and client. Her Honour did not find it necessary to form a concluded view as to the validity of the second submission but said (at [41]) that the first seemed to be correct. Regardless, her Honour approached the issue on the basis that the question was whether, having regard to the nature of the dispute between Ms Rich and PwC that formed the subject matter of the proceeding, the relationship between OGC and PwC was a professional relationship which secured to the OGC's advice an independent character despite the fact that the General Counsel, and one other senior solicitor in the OGC, were also partners in PwC. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] AATA 649">
 
 60 I therefore conclude that, having regard to the nature and significance of the allegations raised by Ms Rich in her letter of 2 July 2004, the relationship between OGC and the respondents was not such as to secure the advice of the OGC concerning Ms Rich's allegations the objectively independent character necessary to support the respondents' claim of client legal privilege. The OGC was not in a position to give professionally detached advice to the respondents concerning allegations of the character of those made by Ms Rich. " [152] 
 
 
110. Once the necessary degree of independence has been established and:
 
"... communications take place between a client and his or her independent legal advisers, or between a client's in-house lawyers and those legal advisers, it may be appropriate to assume that legitimate legal advice was being sought, absent any contrary indications .... In Kennedy v Wallace , [ [153] ] Black CJ and Emmett J inclined to the view that in the ordinary case of a client consulting a lawyer about a legal problem in uncontroversial circumstances, proof of those facts alone will provide a sufficient basis for a conclusion that legitimate legal advice is being sought or given. On the other hand, if the personal loyalties, duties and interests of the in-house lawyer do not influence the professional legal advice which he gives, the requirement for independence will be satisfied. " [149] 
 
 
107. Later that same year, Branson J considered the same question in Rich 
 v Harrington [150] in relation to advice given by the OGC located in Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC). Her Honour found that the person holding the position of General Counsel was a partner of PWC and, as did each of the solicitors in the OGC, held a current practising certificate. That Office operated as a separate unit within PWC and legal advice was provided with the same level of objectivity as would be expected of external lawyers. 108. The only comment made by Branson J on this evidence was that:
 
" ... It may be that as in-house lawyers, including corporate counsel, play an increasingly important role in advising and providing other legal services to their employers and firms, the common law has come to accept that the requisite independence can be ensured by measures of the kind adopted by OGC ... " [151] 
 
 
109. Her Honour declined, however, to decide whether the measures were enough in that case because she had to decide that question in the context of the particular advice that was claimed to attract legal professional privilege. The advice was given in respect of allegations and claims given by one of PWC's partners, 
Ms Rich, against others in the firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 892">The respondent also made a forensic decision not to call the authors of the sample documents and so expose them to cross-examination, despite remarks made by (amongst others) Tamberlin J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2005] FCA 142 at [3] concerning the propriety of such a course and the need for the Court to be satisfied in the case of in-house lawyers of their independence, that is to say, that their personal loyalties, duties and interests do not influence the professional legal advice they give and that the advice in question is of a legal, rather than a commercial nature: cf. Rich v Harrington (2007) FCA 1987 ; (2007) 245 ALR 106 , Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No 2) (2007) FCA 1445 at [35] per Graham J. </sentence>

Branson J in Rich v Harrington [2007] FCA 1987 ; (2007) 245 ALR 106 , had to consider the question of privilege in a context where proceedings had been brought against the members of a partnership, where the legal adviser who had provided the advice in respect of which privilege was claimed was one of the partners. Her Honour had regard to the views expressed by Tamberlin J in Seven Network Limited v News Ltd [2005] FCA 142: 
 

 
"4 The dominant purpose test has particular importance in relation to the position of in-house counsel because they may be in a closer relationship to the management than outside counsel and therefore more exposed to participation in commercial aspects of an enterprise. The courts recognise that being a lawyer employed by an enterprise does not of itself entail a level of independence.</sentence>

 produce a number of information and documents listed on a 10 page 
 attachment. From mid-2006, the respondent raised the claim of client 
 legal privilege in relation to several files and documents, while waiving 
 the privilege in relation to some and producing the others. The 
 Tribunal examined the summonsed documents and agreed with the 
 respondent's claim for legal professional privilege relating to a number 
 of them. In making its decision on the claim of privilege, the Tribunal 
 relied on the decisions of Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for 
 Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No. 2) 
 [2007] FCA 1445 and Rich v Harrington [2007] FCA 1987. Accordingly, 
 the claim for privilege applied to communications which were made for 
 the dominant purpose of giving legal advice to clients. </sentence>

According to the applicants, it is insufficient for a party on a global basis simply to assert that documents were brought into existence for the purpose of legal advice and/or in anticipation of litigation. Moreover, a document brought into existence for the purpose of the investigation cannot be privileged because it is not for the relevant, dominant purpose. </sentence>

In our view, that decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration on appeal. Our understanding of the relevant law which includes Bennett v Chief Executive Officer Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 and Rich v Harrington [2007] FCA 1987 , satisfies us that the Tribunal's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to justify its reconsideration. More importantly, there is no substantive injustice which would result if leave were refused supposing that decision to be wrong. That is because, in our view, even if the decision was wrong and legal professional privilege had been waived, any legal advice would not address an issue in dispute before the Tribunal.</sentence>

The relationship must be independent in order to ensure that the personal interests of the adviser do not influence the legal advice or the impartiality with which legal proceedings are conducted on the client's behalf. This requirement for independence has been reaffirmed in later cases: see Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2005] FCA 142 at [5] ; Rich v Harrington [2007] FCA 1987 at [36] - [46] . </sentence>
