<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 644">The Federal Magistrate also dismissed the second ground. His Honour found that the Tribunal did not make or rely upon any finding that the appellant would not attend demonstrations in the future (ground 2(b)(ii)). He considered that a fair reading of the Tribunal's decision disclosed that the Tribunal had concluded that the political climate in Ethiopia had changed since the appellant had been arrested in 2001 and 2005. This finding was supported by the independent country information. The Federal Magistrate considered that, to make good the second ground, the appellant had to establish "that there was no evidence at all by which the Tribunal could make such a finding" and relied on the decision in SZHZF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1173 at [33] . There was at least some evidence to support its finding that there was not a real chance that, in the reasonably foreseeable future, the appellant would find himself in similar circumstances to those which he had experienced in the past. The second ground was, he considered, an attack on the merits of the decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 98">Although the Applicant asserts that there was no evidence to support the finding made by the Tribunal that the Applicant did not face a real chance of getting caught up in mass arrests in the reasonably foreseeable future, the recent country information to which the Tribunal had regard was at least some evidence upon which its findings could have been based. In order for the Applicant to make good this ground for review, he must establish, in my view, that there was no evidence at all by which the Tribunal could make such a finding. (See SZHZF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1173 at [33] ). In my view, the recent country information was at least some evidence in support of its finding that there was not a real chance that, in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Applicant would find himself in similar circumstances to those which he had experienced in the past. There was evidence that the attitude of the Ethiopian government to its political opponents had softened. This evidence could and did support a finding that, in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Ethiopian government would not engage in mass arrest, detention and mistreatment of demonstrators. (See also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 719 ; [1999] FCA 719 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 at 257). </sentence>
