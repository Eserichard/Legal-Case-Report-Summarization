<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 589">His Honour then discussed and determined the appellant's annulment application. After setting out s 153B(1) of the Act, his Honour extracted [12] of the judgment of Tracey J in Bulic v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited [2007] FCA 307. The Federal Magistrate held that the so-called deficiencies in service were not sufficient in themselves to cause him to exercise his discretion to annul the bankruptcy. He again referred to his finding concerning the solvency of the appellant. He concluded that the appellant had failed to establish any ground for annulling his bankruptcy. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 312">More recently, in Bulic v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited, [2] Tracey J set out the often quoted list of relevant principles as follows: "Section 153B(1) and its predecessors have been considered in many decisions of this and other courts. These authorities establish a number of relevant propositions. They are: (1) an order can be made under section 153B(1) of the Act, notwithstanding that the applicant has been discharged from bankruptcy; (2) an applicant who seeks an annulment of his or her bankruptcy carries a heavy burden. It is incumbent on the applicant to place before the court all relevant material with respect to his or her financial affairs so that the court may be properly informed and make a judgment that is based on the actual circumstances of the applicant; (3) in determining whether or not a sequestration order ought not to have been made, the court is not confined to a consideration of whether the order should have been made, on the facts known to the court at the time at which it was made. The court must take account of facts known at the time at which the sequestration order was made and at which it determines an annulment application, even if those facts were not before the court at the time at which the sequestration order was made; (4) a sequestration order ought not to have been made if, on the facts known at the time of the annulment application, the court would have been bound not to make the sequestration order; (5) the court will be so satisfied if it is established that the debtor was not, at the time the sequestration order was made, indebted to the petitioning creditor; (6) if the court is so satisfied, it is not precluded from annulling the bankruptcy because the bankrupt had not sought to have the default judgment set aside or failed to oppose a creditor's petition or failed to seek a review of the sequestration order; (7) the power conferred on the court by section 153B(1) is discretionary in nature. Even if persuaded that the sequestration order ought not to have been made, the court can, in appropriate circumstances, decline to annul the bankruptcy; (8) considerations which may have a bearing on the exercise of discretion include unexplained delay in the making of the application, whether or not the applicant is solvent, whether or not the applicant has made full disclosure of his or her financial affairs and a failure by the bankrupt to oppose a creditor's petition and attend the hearing at which the sequestration order was made. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 44">The principles upon which the power to annul are exercised have been discussed in a number of authorities. They were recently summarised by Tracey J in Bulic v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited [2007] FCA 307 at [12] : (1) An order can be made under s 153B(1) of the Act notwithstanding that the applicant has been discharged from bankruptcy; Re Oates; ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 17 FCR 402. (2) An applicant who seeks an annulment of his or her bankruptcy "carries a heavy burden". It is incumbent on an applicant "to place before the Court all relevant material with respect to his or her financial affairs so that the Court may be properly informed and may make a judgment that is based on the actual circumstances of the applicant": Re Papps; Ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531.</sentence>

 OFFICIAL TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY 
Respondent
 
 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 This is an application to annul a bankruptcy pursuant to s.153B of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cwlth) (hereinafter referred to as the "Act"). That section provides in subsection (1) that: If the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made or, in the case of a debtor's petition, that the petition ought not to have been presented or ought not to have been accepted by the official Receiver, the Court may make an order annulling the bankruptcy.  The relevant principles relating to the statutory power of annulment are conveniently set out in Bulic v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2007] FCA 307 at [12] (1) An order can be made under s 153B(1) of the Act notwithstanding that the applicant has been discharged from bankruptcy; Re Oates; ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 17 FCR 402. (2) An applicant who seeks an annulment of his or her bankruptcy "carries a heavy burden". It is incumbent on an applicant "to place before the Court all relevant material with respect to his or her financial affairs so that the Court may be properly informed and may make a judgment that is based on the actual circumstances of the applicant": Re Papps; Ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 972">Tracey J in Alfio Peter Bulic v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited [2007] FCA 307 reviewed the authorities and stated at [12]: Section 153B(1) of the Act relevantly provides that: "If the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made ...the Court may make an order annulling the bankruptcy. " Section 153B(1) and its predecessors have been considered in many decisions of this and other Courts. These authorities establish a number of relevant propositions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 916">His Honour Tracey J also sets out in summary form a number of relevant principals applicable to an application under s.153B in Bulic v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 307 at [12] where His Honour states: Section 153B(1) and its predecessors have been considered in many decisions of this and other Courts. These authorities establish a number of relevant propositions. They are: (1) An order can be made under s 153B(1) of the Act notwithstanding that the Applicant has been discharged from bankruptcy; Re Oates; ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 17 FCR 402.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 601">More recently, in Bulic v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 307 , Tracey J has undertaken a review of the authorities. His Honour there set forth as follows his results of that analysis: 
 [12] These authorities establish a number of relevant propositions. They are: 

 
(1) An order can be made under s 153B(1) of the Act notwithstanding that the applicant has been discharged from bankruptcy; Re Oates; ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 17 FCR 402.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1066">32 A person who seeks an annulment carries a " heavy burden ": Re Papps; Ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531 per O'Loughlin J; Bulic v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 307 at [12] per Tracey J. It is for an applicant who seeks an annulment to " bring himself within the section and satisfy the Court, that the sequestration order ought not to have been made ": Pollock v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 94 ATC 4148 at 4153 per Carr J, citing Riley J in Re Calderon (Unreported, Federal Court of Bankruptcy, 31 May 1977). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 1839">In Bulic v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 307 at [12] Tracey J set out a number of the relevant principles: " Section 153B(1) and its predecessors have been considered in many decisions of this and other Courts. These authorities establish a number of relevant propositions.
