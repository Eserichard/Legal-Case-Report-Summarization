<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 888">However, that is not sufficient to make it misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. For similar reasons, I think that it is unlikely that the plaintiff will establish that the unregistered mark of the fourth defendants is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the registered mark used by the plaintiff: cf Starr Partners Pty Ltd v Dem Prem Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1269 ; Cooper Engineering Company Pty Ltd v Sigmund Pumps Limited [1952] HCA 15 ; (1952) 86 CLR 536. For these reasons, I do not accept that there is a serious question to be tried in relation to the plaintiff's case based on misleading or deceptive conduct or infringement of its trademark.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] ATMO 62">Further, and of particular relevance here, I am to consider general effect of the trade marks. In Starr Partners Pty Ltd v Dem Prem Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1269 ; (2006) 70 IPR 113 Edmunds J said at paragraph 35: 
The trade marks must be considered in their entirety. "One must bear in mind the points of resemblance and the points of dissimilarity, attaching fair weight and importance to all, but remembering that the ultimate solution is to be arrived at, not by adding and comparing the results of such matters, but by judging the general effect of the respective wholes. " ( Clark v Sharp (1898) 15 RPC 141 at 146 (Ch D)). It is not sufficient to seize upon and compare the differences between the trade marks, for the overall impressions created may be so similar as to lead to confusion: (See eg William Bailey (Birmingham) Ltd's Appn (1935) 52 RPC 136 (Ch D). </sentence>
