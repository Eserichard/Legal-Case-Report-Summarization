<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 1038">The authorities accepted that, under O 62 r 3(2) of the previous Federal Court Rules, the Court retained a discretion to determine whether or not costs ought be payable forthwith: see McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 (' McKellar ') at [14]---[15], [38]; Life Airbag Company of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Company (New Zealand) Ltd [1998] FCA 545 (' Life Airbag ') at [11]; Courtney v Medtel at [21]; Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 792 at [47] ; and Thunderdome Racetiming and Scoring Pty Ltd v Dorian Industries Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 291 ; (1992) 36 FCR 297 (' Thunderdome ') at 312. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1446">Thirdly, an indemnity costs order involves a departure from the usual position that costs are awarded on a party/party basis. It follows that there must be some special or unusual features to justify such an order being made: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232 --- 233 per Sheppard J and Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234 per Black CJ and French J. Furthermore, where an indemnity costs order is sought on the basis of the misconduct of a party, the Court will require some evidence of that misconduct before making the order: see Rosniak v Government Insurance Office (1997) 41 NSWLR 608 at 616 per Mason P (with whom Meagher and Clarke JJA agreed) and Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 792 at [41] --- [42] per Kenny J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1225">3 As I said in Rahman v Ashpole [2007] FCA 883 at [28] :
 
 'The jurisdiction of the Court to order costs is conferred by s 43 of the FC Act. The discretion is a general one. The Court takes special care when asked to make an order for indemnity costs against an unrepresented litigant but there is no bar to such an order (see Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223 at [55] --- [60] and Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 792 at [41] --- [46]).

 This proceeding commenced on 9 May 2003, with the filing by Ms Wu (referred to hereafter as the applicant) of an application and statement of claim. The history of the proceeding can be ascertained by reference to Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 and Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 792.
