<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 85">The applicant claims to be (a claim apparently not disputed) a manufacturer of rubber components to supply to other manufacturers and a consumer of rubber chemicals. The representative proceeding is now brought on behalf of commercial manufacturers likewise using rubber chemicals either directly or indirectly though, again, how the group is defined will be discussed shortly. 3 This judgment concerns an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of 13 November 2009 ([2009] FCA 1317) striking out the applicant's amended statement of claim. As often happens, the argument in the application for leave to appeal included the argument to be put in the appeal if leave was granted. A convenient way of dealing with the issues raised in the proceedings is to identify, in turn, each element of the statement of claim which the primary judge considered was deficient, his Honour's reasons for reaching that conclusion and my assessment of each of those elements and those reasons.</sentence>
