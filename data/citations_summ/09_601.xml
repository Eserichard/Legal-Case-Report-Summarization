<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 604">Returning to the reasons for judgment of Logan and Flick JJ, after setting out the procedural steps required by the rules in order to facilitate the hearing and resolution of any appeal, their Honours said, at [63]: 
 
 The present matter of concern focuses upon those procedural steps which are aimed at ensuring a Full Court has before it, in a timely and organised manner, all documents necessary for the resolution of the appeal listed for hearing before it. Non-compliance with these rules in particular may not necessarily lead to an appeal being struck out or dismissed: e.g. Jandruwanda v University of South Australia (2003) FCA 1456. But a failure to comply with the provisions which ensure that an appeal can proceed may constitute a failure to prosecute an appeal justifying an order that the appeal be dismissed: e.g. Goldie v The Commonwealth (2004) FCA 973. Whether an order is made that an appeal should be struck out for any such non-compliance with the Rules must necessarily depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case, and upon a consideration of those interests relevant to the proper administration of justice. 
 

 
At paragraph [93] their Honours also relevantly said:
 
 
 The failure of an Appellant to attend to the preparation of an Appeal Book cannot deprive a Respondent of the opportunity to have an appeal heard and resolved as quickly and expeditiously as possible in a manner consistent with the interests of justice: Davidova v Murphy (2009) FCA 601 at [24] . Nor can such a failure deprive a Respondent of the benefits of the success he has achieved before a primary judge.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 899">Mrs Cuskelly's first application clearly invoked the Court's powers under s.104(3) , which allow it to "review an exercise of power by a Registrar ... and may make any order or orders it thinks fit in relation to the matter in respect of which the power was exercised" . On review of a sequestration order made by a Registrar, the Court considers the making of the order de novo in the light of the evidence and circumstances at the time of its review. If the Court decides that a sequestration order should not have been made, then it has an option either to set aside the Registrar's order under s.104(3) , or, alternatively, to exercise the power of annulment under s.153B of the Bankruptcy Act (see Pattison v Hadjimouratis (2006) 155 FCR 226). The annulment power is available "if the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made" , based on new evidence reflecting on the situation at the date of the sequestration order (see Miller v Bondi Securities [1994] FCA 1304 at [19] - [20], Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 ; (2006) 155 FCR 531 at [59] and following paragraphs, and Davidova v Murphy [2009] FCA 601). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 623">The affidavit verifying the pleading is signed by an accountant who deposes to being a director of the first plaintiff, that is, BMG. Putting aside the implications of BMG going into liquidation, there is doubt whether such an affidavit can substantially assist the establishment of the ground referred to in s.52(2)(b) , in the absence of any additional evidence allowing the bankruptcy court itself to assess the factual and legal foundations for projecting a success in the matter (see Davidova v Murphy [2009] FCA 601 at 74). In the present case, I do not consider that it does. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCAFC 28">93 The failure of an Appellant to attend to the preparation of an Appeal Book cannot deprive a Respondent of the opportunity to have an appeal heard and resolved as quickly and as expeditiously as possible in a manner consistent with the interests of justice: Davidova v Murphy [2009] FCA 601 at [24] . Nor can such a failure deprive a Respondent of the benefits of the success he has achieved before a primary Judge. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1202">This Court also has an implied jurisdiction to set aside a bankruptcy notice as an abuse of process: Re Sterling; Ex parte Esanda Ltd [1980] FCA 61 ; (1980) 44 FLR 125. An abuse of process may be made out if the purpose in issuing the bankruptcy notice is to put pressure on a debtor to pay the debt rather than to invoke the Court's jurisdiction in relation to insolvency: Brunninghausen v Glavanics [1998] FCA 230 ; Killoran v Duncan [1999] FCA 1574 at [12] per Gyles J. See also: Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 825 , 233 ALR 81 ; Cavoli v Etl [2007] FCA 1191 at [17] , 5 ABC(NS) 363 at 369 per Heerey J; Slack v Bottoms English Solicitors [2002] FCA 1445 at [15] to [18] per Spender J; Davidova v Murphy [2009] FCA 601 at [88] . It is also an abuse of process for a judgment creditor to pursue bankruptcy proceedings " for the purpose of stifling litigation ": Bayne v Baillieu; Bayne v Riggall [1908] HCA 39 ; (1908) 6 CLR 382 at 396 per Griffith CJ. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 798">Reference was made to Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 , Davidova v Murphy [2009] FCA 601 at [23] and Khera v Jones [2008] FCA 548 at [24] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 612">" Other factors which his Honour took into account in the exercise of his discretion in refusing to annul the bankruptcy were that the bankrupt had delayed for a period of over two years before making the application for annulment and had not placed any evidence before the court to show that he was solvent. Further his Honour stated at 25 "In all the circumstances of the case, even if it were right to say, contrary to the view that I have formed, that the sequestration order ought not to have been made, I would in the exercise of my discretion refuse this application for annulment". 
More recent cases have referred to the same authorities, and have isolated the same principles (see, for example, French J in Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 ; (2006) 155 FCR 531 at [59] and following paragraphs, and Flick J in Davidova v Murphy [2009] FCA 601). </sentence>
