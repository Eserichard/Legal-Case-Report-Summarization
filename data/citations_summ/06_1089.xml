<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 268">Moreover it was contended that the fact that Fijian police were under resourced was not determinative for the question of state protection, as the mere lack of resources did not of itself give rise to the kind of lack of state protection that was necessary to establish a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason ( SZCCF v MIMA [2006] FCA 1089 at [14] ; S152 at [26] and [33]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 361">9 The Tribunal noted information set out in the appellant's application for a protection visa in its decision. Although it was not raised as a ground of appeal, for the sake of completeness I will deal with any suggestion that the Tribunal was obliged under s 424A of the Act to put that information in writing to the appellant. I am satisfied that the Tribunal was not so obliged. The reason for its decision was its inability to be satisfied because of the insufficiency of evidence before it that the appellant had a genuine, well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason ( SZEZI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2005] FCA 1195 at [29] ; SZCIA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238 at [12] ; SZCCF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1089 at [21] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1476">12 Upon reading the Tribunal's decision, it is apparent that the Tribunal found the claim of the appellant to be unsubstantiated and lacking information, and that independent country information was not relied upon by the Tribunal in reaching its decision. It was because of the deficiency in the information provided that the Tribunal reached the decision adverse to the appellant. No details of the appellants alleged practise of Falun Gong was provided and the Tribunal could not be satisfied that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution in the PRC for this reason. Where an applicant is unable to satisfy the Tribunal of the merits of its application, s 424A(1) of the Act is not enlivened: see SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195 at [29] ; SZCIA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238 at [9] - [12]; SZGER v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1162 at [8] ; SZHUT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1022 at [10] ; SZCCF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1089 at [21] ; SZBZO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 474 at [48] - [49].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 1554">18 Bennett J also followed the observations of Allsop J as to the information within s 424A in SZCCF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1089 at par 21 where her Honour said:
 
 'The basis for the Tribunal's decision was that it was the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence before the Tribunal alone that was the reason for affirming the decision of the Delegate. That such information does not come within s 424A(1) has been reaffirmed in SZEEU v Minister of Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at [223] to [224] and again in SZCIA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238 at [12] . ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 1457">15 No detail was provided by the appellant concerning this alleged breach. The Tribunal's obligation pursuant to s 424A only extends to information which the Tribunal considers would be a reason, or part of a reason, for affirming the decision under review. The Tribunal's reasons confirm that it was unable to reach a decision favourable to the appellant because of the absence of information provided. Section 424A(1) does not arise in these circumstances: see SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195 at [29] ; SZCIA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238 at [9] - [12]; SZGER v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1162 at [8] ; SZHUT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1022 at [10] ; SZCCF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1089 at [21] ; SZBZO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 474 at [48] - [49].</sentence>
