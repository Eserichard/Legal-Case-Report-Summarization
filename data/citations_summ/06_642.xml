<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 595">14 The Federal Court of Australia Act and Order 52, rule 20 of the Federal Court Rules provides for what has been described as an 'undeniably broad discretionary judgment' ( Carey-Hazell v Getz Brothers &amp; Co (Aust) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1334 per French J [32]), which is consistent with other expressions of view: note, Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 642 per Tamberlin J [11]. In the decision in Carey-Hazell v Getz , French J noted a number of considerations to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion and those discretionary considerations derive, in large part, from the observations of Hill J in Equity Access v Westpac Banking Corporation (1989) ATPR 40-972 at 50,635, and the observations of Beazley J in KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Melt Glow Pty Ltd [1995] FCA 76 ; (1995) 56 FCR 189. </sentence>
