<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 789">10 Although this is an application that the defendants be punished for civil contempt, not criminal contempt, it is clear that the charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525. Where the contempt consists of a failure to comply with an order of the court, it must be demonstrated that the contempt was wilful and not merely casual, accidental or unintentional: Australasian Meat Industries Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Limited [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98. However, it is not necessary for the applicant to prove that the contemnor intended to breach an order of the court: see Anderson v Hassett [2007] NSWSC 1310 ; Australasian Meat Industries Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Limited [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 111; Matthews v ASIC [2009] NSWCA 155 at [16] per Tobias JA. Nor is it necessary to prove that the contemnor was aware that his or her conduct constituted a breach of the orders: Microsoft Corporation v Marks (No 1) (1996) 69 FCR 117 at 143 per Lindgren J; Metcash Trading Ltd v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 at [9] per Finn J; Matthews v ASIC [2009] NSWCA 155 at [16] per Tobias JA. The order alleged to be breached must be clear and unambiguous: Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 515-6 per Owen J; Metcash Trading Ltd v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 at [9] per Finn J. It must also be capable of being complied with: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1069 at [40] ; Matthews v ASIC [2009] NSWCA 155 at [16] per Tobias JA; Metcash Trading Ltd v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 at [9] per Finn J.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 1465">3 The relevant principles concerning such an application were conveniently summarised by Finn J in Metcash Trading Ltd v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 at [9] , in terms that have been applied in this court on several occasions (for example, by Barrett J in ASIC v Matthews [2009] NSWSC 77 at [5] ):
 
 
 " First , the order alleged to be breached must be clear and unambiguous: see Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 515-516; and be capable of being complied with: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609 at [40] . Secondly , the proper construction of an order is not a matter of fact but a question of law: Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Networks Ltd [2006] FCAFC 41 ; (2006) 150 FCR 110 at [19] . Thirdly , it is not necessary for an applicant to prove that an alleged contemnor intended to disobey the order: ibid, at [17]; nor is it necessary to prove that the alleged contemnor understood the true meaning of the terms of an order or that he or she was aware that his or her conduct constituted a breach of the order: Microsoft Corporation v Marks (No 1) (1996) 65 FCR 117 at 143. Nonetheless it may be highly relevant to the question of penalty that the alleged contemnor disobeyed an order because he or she placed a construction on it that was not it is s true construction: Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd at [38]. Fourthly , deliberate conduct which is in breach of a court order will constitute wilful disobedience of the order, and therefore a civil contempt, unless the conduct be casual, accidental or unintentional: Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at [6] . Fifthly , the facts in issue in a contempt charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWCA 155">16 His Honour relevantly commenced his discussion of the issues by stating (at [5]) that the applicable legal principles had been " usefully and succinctly stated " in the recent judgment of Finn J in Metcash Trading Ltd v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 at [9] in the following terms:
 

 
 
 " First, the order alleged to be breached must be clear and unambiguous: see Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 515-516; and be capable of being complied with: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609 at [40] .

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 266">In Metcash Trading Limited v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 I concluded that there could be no reasonable doubt that Mr Bunn's conduct in publishing the nine allegations contained in three publications particularised in the Statement of Charge was deliberate and that, in making the allegations that he did, he disobeyed the restraint imposed upon him by Order 3.5(c) of Lander J made in this matter on 9 March 2006. I adjourned further consideration of the present motion to permit the parties to put on evidence and make submissions in relation to penalty. </sentence>

 8. The Defendant, Stephen Lewis Matthews is guilty of contempt of this Court in that, in breach of Order 10, on or about 13 June 2008, the Defendant posted a letter dated 13 June 2008 to approximately 1,650 persons, who were the trustees of self managed superannuation funds, through which the Defendant issued invitations to subscribe for shares and/or offered shares in a 'new company vehicle' which had not been formed and which was not otherwise permitted by the Corporations Law or by its replacement, the Corporations Act 2001 .

 The applicable legal principles 
 

5 These were usefully and succinctly stated in the recent judgment of Finn J in Metcash Trading Ltd v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 (20 January 2009) at [9]:
 

 
 
 " First, the order alleged to be breached must be clear and unambiguous: see Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 515-516; and be capable of being complied with: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609 at [40] . Secondly, the proper construction of an order is not a matter of fact but a question of law: Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Networks Ltd [2006] FCAFC 41 ; (2006) 150 FCR 110 at [19] . Thirdly, it is not necessary for an applicant to prove that an alleged contemnor intended to disobey the order: ibid, at [17]; nor is it necessary to prove that the alleged contemnor understood the true meaning of the terms of an order or that he or she was aware that his or her conduct constituted a breach of the order: Microsoft Corporation v Marks (No 1) (1996) 69 FCR 117 at 143.</sentence>
