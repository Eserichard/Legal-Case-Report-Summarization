<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 505">In addition, in that context, the Tribunal notes the obiter comment of Finn J in Shingles v Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority : [8] 
 
 ... where the Parliament amends a provision of an Act (here s 53) but does not expressly amend another which deals with a precursor, but like, provision to that amended (ie s 51) so that the two are no longer harmonious, a court is likely to be slow to assume in the absence of clear contextual justification that there was a legislative intent manifest to impliedly amend that provision or to so change the purpose of the Act through the amendment as to change via contemporary principles of statutory construction the meaning of the unamended provision.
