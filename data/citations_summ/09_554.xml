<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 62">Mansfield J in the AZAAA case identified the issue to be decided as: ... whether, upon remittal of a review to the Tribunal after a decision of the Tribunal has been quashed, the Principal Member may reconstitute the Tribunal by a different member from the member whose decision has been quashed, and who first constituted the Tribunal. [3]  In addition, during argument, Counsel advised that the same issue was to be ventilated in a case before Mansfield J to be dealt with in the near future. His Honour has since heard the argument and delivered his reasons in that case. [2] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] RRTA 972">[In] July 2008 the Tribunal, differently constituted, affirmed the delegate's decision. The applicant again sought review of the Tribunal's decision by the Federal Magistrates Court. The matter was transferred to the Federal Court pursuant to s.476A(1) of the Act and s.39 of the Federal Magistrates Court Act 1999 (Cth), and [in] May 2009 the Federal Court quashed the decision and remitted the matter to the Tribunal for further consideration according to law: AZAAA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 554. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 767">In AZAAA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 554 (per Mansfield J) the Court was concerned with, amongst other things, the reconstitution of the Tribunal. But what was said at [36], and in particular [37], is of assistance in relation to the current issue: "36. Counsel for the applicant submitted that s 421 must be confined to the initial direction of the Principal Member because there is only one "review", and that so long as ss 422 and 422A are not available to change the designated member, the "review" must be conducted by the initially designated member.</sentence>
