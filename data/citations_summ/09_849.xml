<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 536">It therefore comes as no surprise to discover that the decisions of this Court, necessarily by judges at first instance, have suggested that clear cut cases for the grant, or refusal of leave to appeal will obviously be more readily, and speedily, dealt with by a single judge than by requiring the attention of a Full Court: Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 at [8] ( Optiver ), Buchanan J; but that where the case for the grant or refusal of leave is more evenly balanced, considerations of a different kind are raised: Optiver at [9]; and that it may not be necessary to express any firm view about the strength of contentions advanced by an applicant where a case is evenly balanced: Optiver at [18]; or that a direction that the application be determined by a Full Court should not be made in a case which can be characterised as a minor interlocutory squabble over discovery or the like: TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1329 ( TS Production ) at [7] per Heerey J; but that that there may be cases where the presence or absence of either substantial injustice or sufficient doubt is so clear and obvious that the application should be disposed of on that ground alone: TS Production at [11]; or that the case is one, identifiable through experience, where it is not really practicable to separate out the leave issue of whether the decision below is attended with sufficient doubt from the substantive merits: TS Production at [13]; or that the application to appeal is "hopeless": Allphones Retail Pty Ltd ACN 008 168 090 v Weimann [ 2009] FCA 849 ( Allphones ) at [13], McKerracher J; and where the decision has serious implications for the parties or one of them if the decision to be appealed against is allowed to stand: Allphones at [22]; or where the application for leave to appeal is not straight forward, suggesting that on efficiency and cost consideration grounds the direction to the Full Court should be made: Edwards v Santos Limited [2010] FCA 34 at [10] , per Collier J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 34">Whether orders the subject of the application for leave to appeal could properly be characterised as a "minor interlocutory squabble" ( TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1329 at [7] ), or whether important and final consequences for the parties followed from the orders (irrespective whether substantive rights were determined). Whether the applicant's claims raise issues of novel and general importance which should be the subject of consideration by a Full Court. Whether, prima facie , it can properly be said that there are arguments of substance supporting the contention that the primary judgment is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration by the Full Court, or substantial injustice, on the basis that a hopeless application should not be referred to the Full Court ( Allphones Retail Pty Ltd v Weimann [2009] FCA 849 at [13] ). While clearly it is premature at the point of considering the appropriate Court to hear an application for leave to appeal to give detailed consideration to the question whether the applicant can substantiate its case for leave to appeal to be granted, conceptually it is difficult to separate the issue of appropriate forum from the more substantive question whether leave to appeal from the primary judgment should be granted. This was reflected during the hearing before me where extensive submissions were made by Counsel as to the merits of the primary judgment of his Honour. A number of these factors emerge from cases including Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 , TS Production LLC [2008] FCA 1329 , Zegarac v Pitcher Partners [2009] FCA 1061 , Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 849 and Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1516 ; (2008) 172 FCR 469. Consideration

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 135">45 Allphones' application for leave to appeal and the appeal were referred to this Court to be heard together, subject to any other order of the Court (see Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (ACN 008 168 090) v Weimann [2009] FCA 849).
