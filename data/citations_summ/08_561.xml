<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 618">I consider this to be fundamentally inconsistent with the notion that a court can decide that a claimant ought to have been granted a pension or benefit, so that damages for negligently failing to grant that pension or benefit can be awarded. 
 
 Gray ACJ found that the applicants in that case were not entitled to bring proceedings based on a common law duty of care. The various decisions dealing with this subject were summarised by McKerracher J in Pickering v Centrelink [2008] FCA 561 where his Honour stated that there was no private right for damages arising from the exercise of administrative powers where there is a statutory right of review. He said, at [16]: 
 
 As established in Jones v Department of Employment [1989] QB 1 at pp 22 and 25, where an exercise of statutory power is subject to a right of review and the decision-maker exercises the power in good faith, the exercise of the power will not give rise to a common law duty of care. See also X v South Australia (No 3) [2007] SASC 125 at [189] , [196] and Gimson v Victorian WorkCover Authority [1995] VicRp 14 ; [1995] 1 VR 209.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 345">[66] See para.28(e) and footnote 47 above. [67] If there is a right to challenge the decisions made by Centrelink in relation to benefits afforded, or not afforded, to Mr O'Donoghue and his family then the correct mechanism is most likely an appeal to the Social Security Appeal Tribunal, and subsequently the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, there being no private right to claim damages in relation to denied benefits or administrative decisions of Centrelink. See generally Pickering v Centrelink [2008] FCA 561 and Fazio v Centrelink (No. 2) [2008] FMCA 1389 and the cases referred to in both of those matters.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] NSWADT 12">17 The Respondent relies on the evidence of its Legal Director, Ms Miranda St Hill and Ms Juliet Lucy, solicitor. 18 Ms Lucy submits that the complaints are frivolous or vexatious or otherwise misconceived or lacking in substance. She argues that a case is frivolous "if, despite whatever attempts are made to discern a cause of action in a case, it is still not arguable" and it is also frivolous "when it is without substance or groundless or fanciful": Pickering v Centrelink [2008] FCA 561 at [27] , NBGZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 119 ; (2005) 143 FCR 434. The words "frivolous" and "vexatious" are often used interchangeably: NBGZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs at [21]. 19 Further, the '"authorities make it dear that, in any case in which summary dismissal of a proceeding is sought, the focus must be on whether the case is arguable, and not upon whether it is likely to succeed": NBGZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs at [23].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 817">A duty of care under the common law may not arise where an exercise of statutory power is subject to a right of review [41] . That, however, only underscores the importance of addressing squarely any claim of negligence in the review process. If a duty of care is excluded under the general law by the review process, that process then becomes the only vehicle whereby the consequences of negligence may be remedied. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] WADC 116">One of the statutory mandates mentioned by Gray ACJ and is now contained in the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 as quoted earlier by me, involves a mandate to deliver services "in a fair, courteous, prompt and cost efficient manner" (my emphasis). That raises the issue of whether a common law claim might arise for delay in processing a claim. 44 In the decision of Pickering v Centrelink [2008] FCA 561 McKerracher J struck out an action by a disgruntled claimant against Centrelink. The claim alleged that Centrelink failed to allow him to speak to an authorised officer and that he had been arguing with Centrelink about their duties and obligations. It was claimed this failure caused a mental illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 809">Further, it is doubted that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain a damages claim, for the reasons concerning the Court's limited jurisdiction to entertain such private damages claims as explained in Pickering v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 1253 and Pickering v Centrelink [2008] FCA 561.  In Pickering v Centrelink [2008] FCA 561 , in proceeding WAD 45 of 2008 (the 2008 Centrelink proceeding), the Court (on 18 April 2008) dismissed Mr Pickering's application by which he claimed damages of $2.7 million from Centrelink for "all the stress, aggravation, stupidity and time in jail that Centrelink has put me through for not doing their job in the first place". The Court held at [15] that the application as formulated did not disclose a cause of action for damages and, even if it did, there is no private right to damages arising from the exercise of administrative powers when there is statutory right of review of such exercise. The Court also held at [20] that even if the application were to disclose a cause of action for damages it would have no reasonable prospect of success in the light of established authority. The Court further held at [23]-[25] that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the claim. Finally, the Court considered at [26]-[28] that the application should be dismissed because it was a "frivolous" proceeding, in the sense that despite whatever attempts were made to discern a cause of action it was still not arguable; and because it was without substance, or groundless or fanciful.  As the Court explained in Pickering v Centrelink [2008] FCA 561 at [27] , by reference to precedent authority, where a matter is without substance or groundless or fanciful it may be considered "frivolous" or "vexatious" and so constitute "an abuse of process" of the Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 1389">More recently, in Pickering v Centrelink [108] another single Justice of the Federal Court upheld an application for summary dismissal of a claim for damages by the applicant on the basis that there was no private right to claim damages under the SS Act , and there was no matter which arose owing its existence to federal law or depending on federal law for its enforcement, a matter being a right or duty arising under a law made by the Commonwealth Parliament. [109] In Pickering (No.2) the Court followed Scott 2000 and Scott 2004 , and also referred with approval to the extract from the judgment at first instance in Wang cited above in Wang Appeal . The Federal Court therefore held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the matter. [110] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 594">A summary dismissal application ought to be determined quickly or as quickly as is reasonably possible. That, to adopt the words of the old English proverb, is the nature of the beast. [16] Therefore, in the ordinary course it would not be unusual, particularly in this Court, for a summary dismissal application to be heard within two weeks of it being made. In this case, there are further reasons as to why that would not be unusual. The summary dismissal application in this case is relatively straightforward. It is based on a general principle which is relatively well-known and established in the law and has been applied recently by the Federal Court in Pickering v Centrelink. [17] There does appear to be some issue, possibly, around section 39B of the Judiciary Act, 1903 (Cth), but it is noted that that did not seem to particularly trouble the Federal Court in Pickering . </sentence>
