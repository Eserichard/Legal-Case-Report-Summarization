The section 424A letter did refer to the potential application of s 91R(3) of the Act. However his Honour referred to SZLSM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 537 at [41] per Cowdroy J and noted that no consequences flowed from the fact that the Tribunal referred in its s 424A letter to certain matters, when it was not, in fact, obliged to do so. </sentence>
