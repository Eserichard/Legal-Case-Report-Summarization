<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 17">The longest term of imprisonment imposed prior to the present case was 12 months in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 10) [2007] FCA 1814 , upheld on appeal in Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2008] FCAFC 90. That case had a considerable public interest element. Mr Siminton had been soliciting deposits from members of the public, and promising to pay interest, without holding a licence under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth). I would not disturb the costs order made in the Court below. I would not make any order as to the costs of the appeal particularly as the appellant has succeeded, in part at least, by reference to an argument which was not put in the Court below. I certify that the preceding seventy-six (76) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko. Associate:

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1815">5 Mr Siminton relied on the same evidence and submissions which were advanced during the penalty hearing conducted in relation to the contempt findings which I made in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 10) [2007] FCA 1814 at [9] and [11]. This was character evidence given by two of his friends and submissions that he was impecunious but that an unnamed person might be prepared to provide him with some money to pay any fine which the Court might impose.</sentence>
