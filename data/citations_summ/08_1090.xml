<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] RRTA 759">The case of SZJRI v MIAC [2008] FCA 1090 (24 July 2008) examined the issue of whether it is possible in all cases to extricate motivations of punishment or revenge from a Convention nexus. In this case, the Tribunal found that corrupt politicians wanted the applicant punished so as to remove him, the implication being that they wanted the applicant removed so that he would not interfere with the corrupt processing of criminal cases. The judgement reads: 
Although it acknowledged...that revenge is not the antithesis of political struggle, the Tribunal failed to consider all of the relevant evidence necessary to enable it to find whether indeed the revenge threatened arose from one or both of the Convention reasons relied upon. That failure was, in my opinion, a relevant error of law. I do not consider that the Tribunal properly instructed itself as to the law, that even where revenge is the immediate purpose or motive, that it can nevertheless sit within a political context, sufficient to attract the protection of the Convention. As Kirby J pointed out in connection with the political/personal dichotomy, revenge and personal hatred may be the expression, in a particular case, of a political motive: Singh at [141]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1069">Given the facts accepted by the Tribunal, one might have expected arguments and claims from the applicant that the Tribunal misunderstood the nature of the applicant's fear when it restricted it to a fear of a criminal action unconnected with the Convention. I might have been referred to cases such as Minister for Immigration v Singh [2002] HCA 7 ; (2002) 186 ALR 393 or Voitenko v Minister for Immigration (1999) 55 ALD 69 , the witness case Saliba v Minister for Immigration (1998) 159 ALR 247 and the recent decision SZJRI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1090. The applicant was represented and the case was not argued with the benefit of these authorities, so I can only assume that this was a forensic decision taken by the applicant on advice. </sentence>
