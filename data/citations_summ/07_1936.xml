<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] SADC 125">This question arises from two findings with respect to payments received by Web Wealth, the first shortly after January 2005 and the second as a consequence of the judgment of the Federal Court in favour of Helimount's liquidator. In his reasons for judgment, Mansfield J ordered the liquidator to pay Web Wealth Pty Ltd such sum as represents the proceeds of the sale of two properties, the titles thereto being given to Web Wealth by Mr Callipari as security for the January loan. [8] His Honour found two mortgages handed over by Mr Callipari effectively to Web Wealth in support of the subject loans, were equitable mortgages which Web Wealth was entitled to enforce.  The question then becomes whether these sums should be deducted from the $1.1 m for which Mr Callipari is now liable? The findings of Mansfield J were based fairly and squarely on the January 2005 loan agreement. [12] The primary liability thereunder was the principal of $630,000, plus interest at the rate of $63,000 per month, so that as of the date of winding up, 26 July 2006, this had become $1,701 m or thereabouts, and in any event well beyond $1.1 m. The simple fact of the matter is that on any reckoning, the combined total of the subject payments - $360,299.83 --- could not bring that debt below the level of $1.1 m due on the agreement of May 2006, so that in that circumstance it is not appropriate to set them off or deduct them therefrom. Furthermore, as to the $25,000 paid by Mr Callipari, it is difficult to accept this was not brought into account in the negotiations arriving at that figure of $1.1 m, when that agreement was reached.  It is not to the point that the plaintiff did not proceed in default of the payment by Mr Callipari to proceed any further to enforce in the winding up proceedings. It is clear from the Federal Court judgment there were no other remaining funds to be realised, other than what was paid over to Web Wealth. [11] In any case clause 3.2 of the May 2006 agreement allowed it to enforce in an "appropriate court", which it has done in these very proceedings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] SADC 60">As it transpires, Mr Pappas arranged for funds to be sourced from various "outside investors", as he described them. [8] These turned out to be exclusively friends or relatives. Soon after $25,000 cash was received from Mr Callipari. It was allocated to interest accrued over the first month. Later $335,299.83 was recovered by the liquidator of Helimount Pty Ltd. [9] This payment followed an order of a Registrar of the Federal Court of Australia made on 26 July 2006, that Helimount be wound-up in insolvency under the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 . Still later on 6 December 2007, Mansfield J delivered a judgment declaring Web Wealth was entitled to an interest by way of equitable mortgages comprising the proceeds of sale of two Mildura properties owned by Helimount, the titles to which were handed over by Mr Callipari to Mr Pappas, and held as security for the loan of $630,000. [10] The titles to both properties are recorded in Recital B to all versions of the January 2005 loan documentation, as security for the loan.  The plaintiff claims an issue estoppel arises from the decision of Mansfield J in the Federal Court, to the extent that findings were made with respect to the 24 January 2005 agreement, with Web Wealth as lender. In those proceedings Mansfield J made orders in the following terms: [79] 
 
 [32] The parties were agreed upon the appropriate form of orders if I were to reach the conclusion I have reached. I think they are appropriate. I accordingly declare that Web Wealth Pty Ltd has an interest in the fund comprising the proceeds of sale of the land described in Certificates of Title Register Book Volume 9983 Folio 505 and Volume 9593 Folio 463 ("the properties") corresponding to the equitable mortgage in its favour created by the deposit of duplicate certificates of title by Helimount Pty Ltd in January 2005. I also order that the liquidator pay to Web Wealth Pty Ltd such sum as represents the proceeds of sale of the properties less the costs and disbursements of the liquidator in realising the properties.
