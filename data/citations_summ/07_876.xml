<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 360">But that fact does not mean that Mr Halliday is not a "homeowner" within the meaning of that word in the Act. As Greenwood J explained in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Vanderpluym [2007] FCA 876 ; (2007) 161 FCR 388 at 402: 
 
 Section 11(4)(b) of the Social Security Act contemplates a point on a continuum of possible rights or interests. An applicant may be a registered proprietor; a beneficiary under a unit or discretionary trust; a party with the benefit of an agreement for lease for three years or more; a lessee under a registered lease pursuant to such an agreement; a lessee occupying premises pursuant to such arrangements where the lease has not been registered by the lessor; a lessee under an unregistered short term lease for a period of less than three years; a tenant under a written tenancy agreement for a fixed term; a weekly tenant under a written agreement or a weekly tenant under oral arrangements with no fixed term and no terms other than those implied by law. In the last case, the measure of the right or interest enjoyed by the applicant tenant might simply be a right to remedial relief in aid of occupation of the premises to restrain a breach of an obligation implied by law and in that sense the tenant might enjoy an equitable interest. Of course, vesting property (land and a residence) in a company or, for example, a corporate trustee of a discretionary trust coupled with a tenancy agreement conferring occupation in favour of a pension applicant related to the shareholders or directors of the entity has the apparent structural advantage of placing ownership of the home at arms-length yet retaining security of tenure in the home so as to enable a pension applicant to say that he or she is not, in orthodox terms, a homeowner and therefore entitled to a higher assets value limit for the calculation of the relevant pension entitlement. The social policy of the Social Security Act is to adopt a broad notion of 'homeowner' by s 11(4)(b) so as to ensure that those applicants (or their partners) who have a right or interest in a residence which gives reasonable security of tenure in the home are to be treated as homeowners for the purposes of calculating assets value limits and thus pension entitlements. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 736">During the hearing of this application, I stated that if there had not been an advance of money by the applicant into the funds of the Trust there may not be a "loan" for the purposes of s 1122 of the Act as this would not be a case where "a person lends an amount" in terms of the section. Certainly in one recent case where the Federal Court of Australia considered s 1122 , there were funds advanced and still unpaid by the applicant. [10] One issue that was raised was the conceptual difficulty of the enforcement of a loan. This would require the applicant as trustee being sued by the applicant themselves. In the hearing, I raised for consideration that if there was not a transaction of a loan, the entry in the accounts of the Trust of the sum of $3,740,897.65 might nevertheless represent some other "asset" of the applicant such as the value of the equity of redemption of the applicant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 442">The Federal Court in Secretary, Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Dolores Vanderpluym [2007] FCA 876 also concluded that for the purposes of s 1122 of the Act, so much of the loan that remains unpaid is to be included in the calculation of the assets: 
 
 "....As to the monies lent by Mr Vanderpluym to MMPL being the further advances, the remaining unpaid amount of those loans properly forms part of the assets of Mr Vanderpluym and is properly brought to account within the assets value limit calculation applicable to Mrs Vanderpluym...." 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] AATA 466">Mr Black of counsel, who appeared for the Secretary, submitted that Mr Iva's interest as a co-owner permitted him a right of occupation but that right must be qualified in a case such as this by the absence of any beneficial interest in the land. The case for the Secretary was put on the footing that an "objective assessment" [6] of the relationship between Mr Iva and his parents could demonstrate the type of "symmetrical relationship" described by Greenwood J in Vanderpluym . But that case, in my view, was entirely different. The applicants there were renting from a proprietary company of which one of the applicants was the sole director and member. There was, in reality, a symmetrical relationship between landlord and tenant. It could not be reasonably expected that one applicant, qua director of the landlord company, would take steps adverse to his interests as a tenant. That is not the situation that arises here. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] AATA 252">In that case, Mr Vanderpluym was sole director and shareholder of the company which owned the principal home in which he and his wife enjoyed exclusive occupancy on a weekly basis pursuant to oral agreement only. Greenwood J held that the weekly tenancy arrangement coupled with occupation and payment of rent gave rise to an equitable interest in the residence [14] . This was sufficient for Mr Vanderpluym to have a right or interest in the principal home for the purposes of s 11(4)(b) of the SS Act. Because of the control of the tenancy arrangement exercisable by Mr Vanderpluym as sole director and shareholder of the company which owned the principal home, Greenwood J also held that the interest they had in the home gave them reasonable security of tenure in the home, saying: . 
 
 61. ........in this case, Mr and Mrs Vanderpluym enjoyed an equitable interest in the residence in circumstances where they could hold no doubt as to the assured continuity of occupation of the home. The symmetrical relationship between the landlord and the tenant in the sense that either Mr Vanderpluym or Mrs and Mrs Vanderpluym by consensus controlled both the occupation of the premises and the conduct of the landlord makes it clear that Mrs Vanderpluym enjoyed a very high threshold of security of tenure in the residence as principal home. 
 
  For the respondent, Robert Hamilton submitted that the effect of the arrangements between Mr and Mrs Stillhard, on the one hand, and the Fund, on the other hand, is that, as trustees of the Fund which owns the property, Mr and Mrs Stillhard executed a lease of the property to themselves as tenants. Mr Hamilton submitted that, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the FA Act and the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) (the SS Act), the Federal Court decision Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and Vanderpluym [9] and the Tribunal and Federal Magistrates Court decisions in Dart and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [10] , Mrs Stillhard was an ineligible homeowner because the property is her principal home and she a right or interest in the property which gives her reasonable security of tenure in it. 
  It is common ground that the property is the principal home of Mr and Mrs Stillhard and that the Fund is the legal owner of the property. The concept of homeowner in s 11(4)(b) of the SS Act is not limited to the person who has indefeasible title to the land on which the principal residence is built [11] . It includes the tenant of a principal home which, through the device of a discretionary trust of which the tenant is the principal beneficiary, is owned by a trustee company of which the tenant is also sole director and shareholder [12] . Also, absent a trust arrangement, it includes the tenant of a principal home that is owned by a company of which the tenant is sole director and shareholder as arose in Secretary, Department of Workplace Relations v Vanderpluym [13] . There, Greenwood J, noting that s 11(4)(b) of the SS Act did not provide a definition of right or interest , said : 
 
 49. ...........a right or interest in the principal home is synonymous with a right or interest in real property ( Delos Reyes and Secretary, Department of Social Security [1993] AATA 384 ; (1993) 32 ALD 287 p 290; Re Schultz and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2003] AATA 770 ; [2003] 76 ALD 247) ; an interest in property is a right of a proprietary nature not a mere personal right ( Delos , p 291); a person occupying a property even under a tenancy at will with no written agreement is to be regarded as having an interest in real property and not simply as having rights under a contract and such an interest is a 'right or interest in a residence' for the purpose of the section ( Re Johnston and Repatriation Commission (31 May 1994, AAT, Full Tribunal, unreported No. 9508); a tenancy at will is enforceable at equity and confers an interest in real property which represents a right or interest under the section ( Koch and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2002] AATA 407 ; (2002) 68 ALD 651 at p 655 [18]); lessees under a written lease for three years with two 5 year options from a company controlled by the lessees enjoyed a right of interest under the Act ( Re Secretary of Social Security and Williams (1998) 52 ALD 418) ; established legal relationships put in place by an applicant should be given their real legal effect in determining whether an unpaid loan to a trustee of a discretionary trust should be brought to account as an asset of a claimant ( Re Schultz ). ......

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] AATA 167">Mr Ivory is a shareholder in the company that owns the property. Shareholders do not have any legal or equitable interest in the property of a company simply because they hold shares in that company. But the cases make it clear that the social security law takes a broader view of what might constitute a right or interest in property: see Secretary, Department of Workplace Relations v Vanderpluym [2007] FCA 876 ; see also Dart v Secretary, Department of family and Community Services [2004] FMCA 485. A tenancy agreement like the one in this case might confer a sufficient right to satisfy the section. In Dart , a tenancy agreement was regarded as sufficient. In Vanderpluym , the Federal Court accepted that an oral, week to week tenancy might suffice. I am satisfied the applicant in this case does have a right or interest in his home in the sense intended by the legislation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] AATA 124">I note the Federal Court has recently considered this statutory provision again but the facts there were a novel and more complex arrangement and pertained only to s 1118(b) (see Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Vanderpluym [2007] FCA 876 per Greenwood J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] AATA 702">So, for example, in Secretary, Department of Social Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Vanderpluym [115] Greenwood J considered the word " interest " in s 11(4)(b) as part of the definition of a " homeowner ".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] AATA 668">The Federal Court in Secretary, Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Dolores Vanderpluym [2007] FCA 876 also concluded that for the purposes of section 1122 of the Act, so much of the loan that remains unpaid is to be included in the calculation of the assets. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] AATA 624">In Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Vanderpluym [2007] FCA 876 Greenwood J stated at [58]: 
 [58] ...The social policy of the Social Security Act is to adopt a broad notion of 'homeowner' by s 11(4)(b) so as to ensure that those applicants (or their partners) who have a right or interest in a residence which gives reasonable security of tenure in the home are to be treated as homeowners for the purposes of calculating assets value limits and thus pension entitlements. 
 ... 
 [60] Section 11(4)(b) of the Social Security Act contemplates an 'interest' which is either a legal or an equitable interest. However, the reference to the term 'right' also contemplates a class or species of 'right' which may not necessarily involve a legal or equitable interest in the residence...Accordingly, having regard to the objectives of the Social Security Act and the disjunctive reference, the term 'right' is not to be read in a way which is simply a synonym for 'interest' which comprehends a legal or equitable interest in the residence. The balance the legislation seeks to strike in determining whether an applicant is a homeowner in respect of a principal home is achieved by the application of the second limb of s 11(4)(b) which asks the question whether such a right 'gives' to the person with that right, reasonable security of tenure in the home. The same question is asked in respect of a legal or equitable interest. The different character of the right or interest will inform the objective assessment of reasonable security of tenure in the home. 
 ... 
 [61] ...It is the conjunction of the character of the right or interest and the circumstances in which it arises that conveys an objective sense of whether the right or interest confers reasonable security of tenure in the home.

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] AATA 1141">The irrecoverability of the outstanding amount is not a reason to exclude that part of the loan from her assets at an earlier time. To do so would be inconsistent with s 1122 of the Act and the settled authorities on this point, concerning the inclusion of the unpaid part of such a loan as an asset, for the purposes of ss 9 , 11 , 500Q and 1122 and the assets value limit calculation. [6] The total of the loan must be included even if Mrs Wicke-Fitzgerald did not gain a net advantage from the loan transaction so far as her assets were concerned. [7]

As was the case in Vanderpluym , Mr Lountzis and his wife appear to be tenants at will under an oral undocumented arrangement with their son Alex. </sentence>
