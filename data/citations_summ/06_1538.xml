<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 1732">His application was dismissed, and appeals to the Federal Court and High Court were dismissed or refused (see SZCBQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 735 ; SZCBQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1538 ; and SZCBQ v MIMA &amp; Anor [2007] HCATrans 454).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1031">In SZCKD [2006] FCA 451 the information had been provided to the Tribunal by the applicant's agent in a 31 page facsimile including a number of other documents. In VWBF [2006] FCA 851 ; [2006] FCA 851 ; 154 FCR 302 the information in question was advanced on behalf of the applicant in a letter from his migration agent which stated that the applicant had already sent a statement to the Tribunal and requesting reference to a number of earlier statements and interviews. In SZCBQ [2006] FCA 1538 the applicant had stated in his application to the Tribunal 'Please Refer my Statement Claim of my Refugee Application'. I am unable to distinguish from this variety of language found to have effect as a giving for the purpose of s 424A(3)(b) from the language used by the present appellant. He expressly invited reconsideration about all his papers submitted.  26 On the issue of republication and adoption, there is a 'blizzard of cases': VWBF [2006] FCA 851 ; 154 FCR 302 at [23] per Heerey J. It is necessary, in the light of the facts in this appeal, to distinguish and put to one side generally those cases raising the issue of whether information has been given for the purpose of the application to the Tribunal where the information has been elicited as the consequence of a question from the Tribunal to an applicant. Of more relevance here on their facts are those cases where the applicant has expressly advanced information that had been initially given to the Department as part of the case on review to the Tribunal. In drawing this distinction in MZXFQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 826 Kenny J cited as illustrative of this latter category M55 [2005] FCA 131 at [25] per Gray J; VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271 at [11] per Merkel J; SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 at [24] and [50] per Rares J; SZCKD v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 451 at [37] per Graham J; VWBF [2006] FCA 851 ; 154 FCR 302 at 312 per Heerey J; and SZCBQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1538 at [12] per Bennett J. As her Honour stated, in these cases s 424A(3)(b) was held to apply. Examination of the manner of giving in each of them may be instructive in relation to the effect of the words used by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 826">42 The parties referred to numerous decisions in which an issue of this kind arose. In some of these cases, the applicant expressly advanced information that had been initially given to the Department as part of the case on review to the Tribunal: see M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 at [25] per Gray J; VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271 at [11] per Merkel J; SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 (" SZGGT ") at [24] and [50] per Rares J; SZCKD v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 451 at [37] per Graham J; VBWF v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at 312 per Heerey J; and SZCBQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1538 at [12] per Bennett J. In these cases, s 424A(3)(b) was held to apply. </sentence>
