 JUDGE: SACKVILLE J DATE OF ORDER: 27 JULY 2007 WHERE MADE: SYDNEY 

 THE COURT DIRECTS THAT: 

 
 1. Optus, on or before 24 August 2007, file and serve draft Short Minutes of Order disposing of the Cross-Claim. As events transpired, the statements made by 33 lay witnesses were admitted into evidence. Of these witnesses, 28 were cross-examined, while the makers of the remaining five statements were not required for cross-examination. &#8226; I rejected two ' expert ' reports tendered on behalf of Seven, amounting in all to 529 pages: Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 14) [2006] FCA 500 (rejecting the tender of a report by Mr Salter valuing Seven's lost opportunity to become an ' integrated media company' ); Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 15) [2006] FCA 515 (rejecting the tender of a report by Mr Kinsella discussing ' subscription drivers ' for pay television). These rulings relieved the Respondents from the need to call the authors of reports, comprising some 111 pages, replying to Mr Salter and Mr Kinsella. In addition, the Respondents chose not to tender a further three expert reports that had been filed.</sentence>
