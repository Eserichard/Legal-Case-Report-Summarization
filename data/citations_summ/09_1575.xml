<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 491">The solicitor for the respondent submitted that the application should be dismissed on the basis that it was not competent as the requirements of r.3.02 were not met, in accordance with the approach taken by Edmonds J in O'Meara v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1575 (and see Batterham v Makeig (2010) 7 ABC(NS) 575; [2010] FCA 50). In O'Meara , no affidavit was filed with or accompanying an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice which was filed within the time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice. Edmonds J held that there had been a non-compliance with r.3.02 of the Federal Court (Bankruptcy) Rules 2005 (Cth) (which are, relevantly, in the same form as the Federal Magistrates Court (Bankruptcy) Rules ) because no affidavit was filed with or accompanying the application and, while affidavits were filed subsequently, no affidavits satisfying the requirements of the Rules had been filed before the expiration of the time fixed for compliance with the bankruptcy notice, even though the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice was filed within that time. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 50">The application to set aside the bankruptcy notice was listed before the District Registrar this morning. The parties were agreed that an extension of time to comply with the bankruptcy notice should be granted. However, the District Registrar drew attention to a judgment of Edmonds J delivered on 22 December 2009 ( O'Meara v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1575 ( "O'Meara" )). In that judgment, Edmonds J referred (at [10]) to the necessity for strict compliance with rule 3.02 of the Federal Court (Bankruptcy) Rules 2005 . That rule requires, in part, that an affidavit accompanying an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice state the date when the bankruptcy notice was served on the applicant. </sentence>
