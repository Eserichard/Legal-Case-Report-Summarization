<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 487">The difficulty which I have with this assertion is this, firstly, Middleton J in SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 said with regard to a ground complaining of inadequate interpretation: "With respect for the first ground, in order for the appellants to succeed, they need to establish, by probative evidence, that: (a) the standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was so inadequate that the appellants were effectively prevented from giving evidence at the hearing; or (b) errors made by the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing were material to the conclusions of the Tribunal adverse to the appellants [authorities omitted]. " 
The applicant has not provided me with any evidence at all. And although his complaint about the paragraph has an initial ring of possible truth to it, on closer examination, it appears to have some difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 380">It was not disputed that the principles referred to in Appellant P119/2002 (which have been followed or cited with approval on numerous occasions: for example WALN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 131 ; SZJZE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1653 ; SZJZS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 102 ALD 318 ; [2008] FCA 789 ; SZNCW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 818 ; SZHEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 783 ; SZGSI and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2009) 107 ALD 414 ; [2009] FCA 200) are applicable. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1219">The second ground was that: "The Tribunal failed to consider the first respondents invite the applicant for a hearing using the assistance of a different interpreter. " 
I find this ground difficult to understand. If it is a complaint about the interpretation at the hearing before the Tribunal then this cannot be made to the court without some evidence to support it. Whilst inadequate interpretation can amount to a breach of s.425 ; M175 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1212 per Gray J, a claim such as that must be proved. Middleton J said in SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 at [21] :
 
 "In order for the appellants to succeed they need to establish by probative evidence that: (a) the standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was so inadequate that the appellants were effectively prevented from giving evidence at the hearing; or (b) errors made by the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing were material to the conclusions of the Tribunal adverse to the appellants. " [There follows a series of authorities] 

It is normal in cases of this nature to have a transcript of the evidence and some evidence from a qualified interpreter that shows what the alleged failings are. None of this has been provided in this case and that ground must be rejected. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1068">The integers of jurisdictional error arising out of mistranslation as articulated in P119/2002 , as extracted, appeared to have been accepted in a number of Federal Court decisions; WALN v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 131 per Ryan J (with whom Tamberlin and Middleton JJ agreed at [29]); SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 per Middleton J and SZJZS v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 789 per Flick J. In this year alone, three Judges of the Federal Court, hearing matters on appeal from this Court, have made direct reference and set out with approval the two criteria referred to in P119/2002. SZNCW v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 818 per Barker J; SZHEW v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 783 per Jagot J, where her Honour said at [49]; This approach reflects the reasoning of Kenny J in Perera v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1999) 92 FCR 6; [1999] FCA 507.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 972">The complaints about interpretation may also be particulars of the breach of natural justice claim by the applicant. Whilst I accept that there are circumstances in which a failure to interpret would mean that the applicant was not provided with a proper hearing pursuant to s.425 of the Migration Act 1958 (the "Act") this is not one of those cases because the applicant has not provided appropriate evidence. And insofar as natural justice is concerned the applicant is subject to the provisions of s.422B of the Act and has not provided the court with any particulars of a breach of the Division. Insofar as the interpretation complaints are concerned I would note that SZGYM v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1923 is authority for the argument that inadequate interpretation can amount to breach of s.425 but that SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 per Middleton J at [21] makes it clear that the applicant has to establish by probative evidence that: "(a) The standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was so inadequate that the appellants were effectively prevented from giving evidence at the hearing; or (b) Errors made by the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing were material to the conclusions of the Tribunal adverse to the appellants. " 
Finally, the full bench in WACO v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 171 indicated that a perfect translation was not necessary. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 180">If the applicant is making a complaint about the quality of the translation which would constitute a claim that s.425 of the Act has not been complied with, he would have to do more than to make a bold assertion at the hearing. While the Court accepts that inadequate interpretation can amount to a breach of s.425: SZGYM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 1923 , there is a strong obligation upon the applicant to establish inadequate interpretation: SZJZE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 1653 where his Honour, Middleton J said at [21]: "With respect to the first ground, in order for the appellants to succeed they need to establish by prohibitive evidence that: (a) the standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was so inadequate that the appellants were effectively prevented from giving evidence at the hearing; or (b) errors made by the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing were material to the conclusions of the Tribunal adverse to the appellants [see authorities there cited]. 
It should also be remembered that in WACO v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2003] FCAFC 171 the Full Bench said at [66]:
 
 "However, the requirement is not that there be a perfect translation, it suffices that the translation is sufficiently accurate to permit the idea or concept being translated to be communicated. " 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 109">Finally, the applicant told me that the interpreter could not help her communicate very well with the Judge. Apparently, the interpreter had told her about halfway through the hearing that she was not feeling well. Once again I have no evidence of this, other than the applicant's statement. If she really wished to allege that interpreting difficulties were such as to bring her within the scope of authorities such as SZGYM v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1923 , M175 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1212 , SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 , Perera v Minister for Immigration [1999] FCA 507 , she would have to produce some evidence. This could have been from the interpreter herself or from the hearing tape. Once again nothing was produced to me. This Court is only able to deal with matters as they come before it on the day of the hearing. The applicant did not ask for an adjournment to obtain the tape but had she done so, I would have been reluctant to grant it. The applicant has had considerable notice of this hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 1601">Before me today the applicant said that the member could not understand what she was saying and therefore he was biased against her. I note that the applicant had the benefit of a Cantonese interpreter who she had specifically requested in her response to the hearing invitation. She has not produced any evidence that the interpretation was inadequate. It is clear that an applicant must establish to a very high standard the inadequacy of any interpretation SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 at [21] and the authorities there referred to; WALN v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 131 at [29] and the authorities there referred to. This test can only be passed by the bringing of evidence and here none has been brought. In any event a failure of interpretation is not an indicator of bias or apprehended bias. The applicant then read out from a document written in Mandarin or Cantonese which made further allegations of bias without any particulars and claimed that the Tribunal did not judge her application in accordance with the Act and refused her application without any evidence or material. Of course, it is up to the applicant to establish her own claim, the Tribunal is not a contradictor, Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [187], SZATG v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCA 1595 per Hely J at [36], Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration (2003) 197 ALR 389 per Kirby J at [78]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 1462">15 His Honour also found that there was no proof that the standard of interpretation was inadequate, in the sense described by Justice Middleton in SZJZE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1653. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1397">14 In relation to the fourth ground, his Honour interpreted this claim as a failure to comply with s 425 of the Act and found that the appellant bore a heavy onus in demonstrating that the hearing conducted by the Tribunal failed to 'fulfil the promise of the invitation' to hearing, citing SZJZE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1653. His Honour then said: '... one would say that in order for the [appellant] to establish that the length of the hearing and the nature of the questioning was such as to negative any ability of the [appellant] properly to put his case, he would have to produce, at the very least, the tape-recording and preferably a transcript of the hearing. The [appellant] has not done this and has not requested an adjournment to do so. I am unable to assist the [appellant] in relation to this ground'.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 880">In SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 Middleton J opined at [21] 
"in order for the appellants to succeed they need to establish by probative evidence that:
 
 (a) the standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was so inadequate that the appellants were effectively prevented from giving evidence at the hearing; or
 
 (b) errors made by the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing were material to the conclusions of the Tribunal adverse to the appellants. Citations omitted. "
 
I do not have anything before me that would assist me to make a conclusion on either of these aspects of the matter. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 881">However, although also in relation to the interpretation, the Courts have placed a heavy onus upon an applicant to establish that the hearing did not fulfil the promise of the invitation. So in SZJZE v Minister [2007] FCA 1653 Middleton J said at [21]: "With respect to the first ground, in order for the appellants to succeed they need to establish by probative evidence that: (a) the standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was so inadequate that the appellants were effectively prevented from giving evidence at the hearing; or (b) errors made by the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing were material to the conclusions of the Tribunal adverse to the appellants. " 
By analogy one would say that in order for the applicant to establish that the length of the hearing and the nature of the questioning was such as to negative any ability of the applicant properly to put his case, he would have to produce, at the very least, the tape-recording and preferably a transcript of the hearing. The applicant has not done this and has not requested an adjournment to do so. I am unable to assist the applicant in relation to this ground. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 744">The sixth claim made by the applicant related to the interpretation. This matter was raised by the applicant today at the hearing. The applicant claimed that the interpretation was inadequate and did not express the real substance of his evidence. An inadequate interpretation can amount to a breach of s.425 of the Act; SZGYM v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1923 ; SZIWK v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 168 , but in order to obtain relief on this ground the applicant must prove that the interpretation is inadequate. As Middleton J said in SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 at [21] : "With respect to the first ground, in order for the appellants to succeed they need to establish by probative evidence that: (a) The standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing was so inadequate that the appellants were effectively prevented from giving evidence at the hearing; or, (b) Errors made by the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing were material to the conclusions of the Tribunal adverse to the appellants. See generally Appellant P119/2002 v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 230 at [17] " (and numerous other authorities cited) 
The applicant has not complied with the strictures identified by Middleton J and has merely asserted a failure of the interpretation at the Tribunal hearing. </sentence>
