<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1309">In this case, the break fee was not payable simply because the shareholders of ABB Grain did not approve the scheme of arrangement and therefore it could not influence the voting at the meeting ( Re Bolnisi Gold NL (No 2) [2007] FCA 2078 ; (2007) 165 FCR 45 at 46 [2] ; Re Adelaide Bank Limited at [31] per Lander J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSC 367">In Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [14] Lindgren J said: 
 
 
 Break fees are justified by reference to: 
 
 the costs incurred by the offeror company; the benefit that that company confers on the members of the target company by increasing its value; and the desirability from the viewpoint of those members that takeover offers be made to them. [15] 
However the authorities recognise that it may be appropriate for the Court to decline to order that a scheme meeting be convened, if the Court is satisfied that the break fee is so large as to be likely to coerce the shareholders into agreeing to the scheme, rather than assessing the offer on its merits. [16] 
 
 27 The evidence is that the amount of the break fee is a genuine estimate of the costs reasonably incurred by Asia Pacific Healthcare as a result of entering into the scheme arrangement. [17] The amount of the fee is around the limit of the level of fees that the Takeovers Panel generally regards as not anti-competitive. [18] There is, in any event, a carve out from the obligation to pay all or part of the break fee if it is unlawful or involves a breach of directors' duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 517"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1141">21 Clause 10 of the MID provides for payment of a break fee of $2.7 million should certain events occur. A break fee in that sum is payable not only by AEL but also by ROC, that is to say, it is a "reciprocal" break fee. In addition, it should be noted that the break fee is only payable "for cause" and that it is not a "naked no vote break fee": cf Re Bolnisi Gold NL (No 2) [2007] FCA 2078 ; (2007) 243 ALR 545 at [9] ff. The amount of the break fee is less than 1% of the Scheme Consideration: see Takeovers Panel's Guidance Note 7: Lock Up Devices .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] NSWSC 745">46 There is a fee payable in various circumstances under clause 13.2, including where a competing transaction is announced and completed within 12 months of the scheme meeting. But it is not a "naked no vote" fee (cf Re Bolnisi Gold NL (No 2) [2007] FCA 2078 ; (2007) 65 ACSR 510). That is, no fee is payable in the event that the requisite approvals are not obtained from the MCAG securityholders. Furthermore, it is a "reimbursement fee", defined to mean the actual costs (not including opportunity costs) reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Bidder up to a maximum of $8 million. Mr Moss said that the cap on the reimbursement fee equated to approximately 0.9565% of the equity value of the Bidder's cash offer, and therefore conformed to the guidance as to quantum of a break fee contained in the Takeovers Panel's Guidance Note 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] NSWSC 323">22 There is a very helpful analysis of the issues relevant to "break fee" provisions of this kind in the judgment of Lindgren J in Re Bolnisi Gold NL (No 2) [2007] FCA 2078. The proposal before me seems to fit the criteria there discussed. The fee provisions should not cause the court to withhold the relief now sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 428">37 The amount of the break fee is payable for cause, that is to say, it is not a naked no vote provision: see Re Bolnisi Gold NL (No 2) [2007] FCA 2078 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1867. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 310">7 Clause 10 of the MID for the Nexus Scheme provides for payment of a break fee by each of Anzon Energy or Nexus in the amount of $2.5 million should certain events occur. Accordingly, the break fees are "reciprocal" or "mutual". The break fee payable by Anzon Energy is not a "naked no vote" break fee: cf Bolnisi Gold NL (No 2) [2007] FCA 2078. The amount of $2.5 million is less than the 1% "guidance ceiling" accepted by the Takeover Panel. There is evidence before the Court of a kind to which I referred in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [55] .
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 309">6 As noted in the earlier Reasons at [25]---[28], the Merger Implementation Deed (MID) for the ARC Scheme provided in cl 10 for a break fee of $4 million. Since the directors of Anzon Australia have withdrawn their support for the ARC Scheme in favour of the Nexus Scheme, that amount has been paid to ARC. The new MID between Anzon Australia and Nexus provides in cl 10 for a break fee in an identical amount. As under the earlier MID, there are reciprocal break fees and Anzon Australia's liability to pay the break fee is not triggered simply by the Shareholders voting down the Scheme (a "naked no vote" break fee): cf Re Bolnisi Gold NL (No 2) [2007] FCA 2078. The amount of the break fee represents 0.63% of the total equity value of Anzon Australia, which is well below the Takeover Panel' s 1% "guidance ceiling". The reasonableness and appropriateness of the break fee is supported by affidavit evidence of the kind to which I referred in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [55] .
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 64">38 Clause 11 of the Implementation Agreement imposes a break fee provision. Break fees are also now a commonplace feature in proposed agreements for schemes of arrangements and in merger and takeover agreements, both in Australia and overseas. See per Lindgren J in APN News Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400 at [43] . As his Honour said at [44], break fees are justified by reference to the costs incurred by the offeror company; the benefit that that company confers on the members of the target company by increasing its value; and the desirability, from the viewpoint of those members, that takeover offers be made to them. His Honour then went on to consider contemporary practice in relation to break fees. There is a more lengthy discussion by his Honour of general considerations relating to break fees in Bolnisi Gold NL in the matter of Bolnisi Gold NL (No 2) [2007] FCA 2078 at [9] - [30]. It is a most helpful discussion.</sentence>
