<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] WASC 52">96 In support of this contention, Clambake relies on authority to the effect that timetables specified in leases for rent review clauses are not treated as being of the essence of the contract, in the absence of clear contrary indications. The submission is that time is presumed not to be of the essence in relation to the right to invoke a rent review: United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley Borough Council [1978] AC 904 and GR Mailman &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Wormald (Aust) Pty Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 80 (Gleeson CJ). In Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 219 , Weinberg J cited United Scientific Holdings Ltd with approval and observed that:
 
 That is, despite the lessors' tardiness, not only did they maintain their rights to rent reviews, but once the rent reviews were completed, the revised rent applied retrospectively as if those reviews had been completed on time. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1979">15 It is well accepted that the aim of the court's power to amend under O 13 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules is to allow all the issues which arise in a proceeding to be determined and for a decision to be given on the real matter in controversy. Hence it has been emphasised that amendments to pleadings should be allowed if it not be unjust to do so: see Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 219 at [122] . The imperative in favour of amendment has been long accepted and is illustrated, for example, in the observations of Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ in Leotta v Public Transport Commission (NSW) (1976) 9 ALR 437 at 446 where their Honours said:
 If in the cause of action upon which the plaintiff sued there had emerged at the conclusion of the evidence facts which, if accepted, established that cause of action, then it was the duty of the trial judge to leave the issue of negligence to the jury. The pleadings should have been amended in order to make the facts alleged and the particulars of negligence precisely conform to the evidence which had emerged ... Now, and for many years past, a plaintiff does not fail by being refused leave to amend or through failure formally to apply for amendment, where the evidence has disclosed a case in the cause of action fit to be determined by the tribunal of fact. Particularly is this so when the action finally determines the rights of the parties in the cause of action. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] QDC 266">Weinberg J refused leave to amend pleadings after the close of evidence in Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 219 for reasons which included, among others, the fact that the applicant's submissions were not compelling: 
 
 
 [124] ... it is clear that the strength of the applicant's case, in relation to the proposed amendment, is a relevant consideration , when determining whether to grant leave to amend.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] NSWSC 902">40 In Mannai Investment Co Limited v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd [1997] UKHL 19 ; [1997] AC 749 , Lord Steyn said (at 767) that notices containing errors may nonetheless be valid if sufficiently clear and unambiguous to leave a reasonable recipient in no reasonable doubt as to how and when they are intended to operate [for which his Lordship cited Delta Vale Properties Ltd v Mills [1990] 1 WLR 445 , 454 E-G (Slade LJ; Stocker and Bingham LJJ agreeing); and Carradine Properties Ltd v Aslam [1976] 1 WLR 442 , 444]. His Lordship added (at 771) that notices must be interpreted in accordance with business commonsense. Mannai established a "reasonable recipient test" for the construction of contractual notices - in essence, approaching the task from the perspective of a reasonable recipient, with knowledge of the terms of the relevant contract and taking into account the surrounding circumstances - which has since been applied consistently [ Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1123 ; (2004) 210 ALR 244 ; MLW Technology Pty Ltd v May [2005] VSCA 29 ; Etlis v New Age Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 165 ; McIntyre v Marshall [2004] NSWSC 412 ; Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 219 ; P. Butt, "Uncertainty in Rent Review Notices" (2006) 80(7) ALJ 421]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 748">1 Judgment in this matter was delivered on 15 March 2006: Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 219 ("the primary judgment"). However, the question of the form of the final orders, and issues relating to costs, remain outstanding. This judgment deals with those matters.</sentence>
