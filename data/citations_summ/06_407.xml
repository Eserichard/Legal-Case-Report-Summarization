<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 822"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 230">This statement of principle has been applied in a number of first instance decisions of this Court: see Nicholls v Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2009] FCA 123 at [4] per Mansfield J; Re Universal Music (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sharman Licence Holdings Ltd; Ex parte Merlin BV [2008] FCA 783 at [31] - [33] per Jacobson J; Rich v Harrington [2007] FCA 1979 at [23] per Branson J; Y v University of Western Australia (No 2) [2006] FCA 466 ; (2006) 151 FCR 322 at 332 [46] per Siopis J; Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 2) [2006] FCA 407 ; (2006) 232 ALR 398 at 403 [18] per French J. The earlier decision of Finkelstein J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 3) [2002] FCA 609 was to a similar effect except that the reasoning was in terms at [7] confined to: 
... cases where a non-party seeks access to material which has been relied upon by the judge. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] WASCA 209">45 The principle of open justice has, of course, been the subject of decisions in many jurisdictions. The position in the Federal Court was recently summarised conveniently by French J (as his Honour then was) in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission; Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 2) [2006] FCA 407 [16] - [20]:
 
 The principles governing access to affidavits which have been received into evidence were discussed recently by Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 9) [2005] FCA 1394 , a judgment which was delivered on 5 October 2005. The point of departure adopted by his Honour was the proposition stated by the Full Court in R v Davis [1995] FCA 1321 ; (1995) 57 FCR 512 at 514: 
 
 
 'Whatever [the media's] motives in reporting, their opportunity to do so arises out of a principle that is fundamental to our society and method of government: except in extraordinary circumstances, the courts of the land are open to the public. This principle arises out of the belief that exposure to public scrutiny is the surest safeguard against any risk of the courts abusing their considerable powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 783">31 This is hardly surprising because the principle which informs the exercise of the power is that of open justice, the underlying rationale being the belief that exposure to public scrutiny is the surest safeguard against abuse of power of the courts: see Seven Network at [21]ff; Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 2) [2006] FCA 407 ; (2006) 232 ALR 398 at [16] ff; Rich v Harrington [2007] FCA 1979 ; (2007) 99 ALD 297 at [17] ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 1168">I agree ... that a convenient touchstone for determining the question of access by non-parties is whether the documents or other material have been admitted into evidence. In general, the application of this principle will serve the interests of open justice. In particular, access to the documentary evidence can be expected to be helpful to a person seeking to understand or explain the proceedings, or to evaluate the Court's determination of the issues arising in the proceedings ...' 

The above passage was approved by French J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission, in the matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey (No 2) [2006] FCA 407 at [18] . 0
 
 I agree with Rares J in Llewellyn that the approach adopted in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in which different rules apply, is different from the approach adopted by the rules of this Court: see at [21] and [22] of his Honour's judgment. Pursuant to O 46 r 6(1) of the Federal Court Rules , a non-party will generally be entitled to access the pleadings.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 466">46 I agree, however, with respect, with the observations of Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 9) [2005] FCA 1394 that in exercising the discretion under O 46 r 6(3) of the Rules, considerable weight will be given to the principle of open justice. Further, a court is more likely to grant access to affidavits which have been admitted into evidence at a hearing than to affidavits which have been filed with the court but have not been admitted into evidence (see French J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission, in the matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey No 2 [2006] FCA 407 at [17] ). It will only be in exceptional cases that access will not be granted where an affidavit has been admitted into evidence (see Macquarie Radio Network Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Authority [2002] FCA 1408 at [20] ). Nevertheless, each case must be considered in the context of its own circumstances.</sentence>
