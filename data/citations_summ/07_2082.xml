37 The primary judge relied upon the decision in Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [No 3] [2007] FCA 2082 and, on appeal, at [2008] FCAFC 136 ; (2008) 249 ALR 458 , in support of this view. In that case the Full Federal Court placed considerable weight upon the fact that the clause there under consideration required provision of a performance guarantee in the form of that set out in an appendix and that the form referred to the payment by the guarantor "notwithstanding any dispute(s) pending", without reference to the contractor and "without any demur, reservation, contest or protest" [2008] FCAFC 136 ; (249 ALR 458 at [30] and [88] --- [112]). Whilst the Clause pursuant to which the bonds were provided in the present case (Clause 6.1) refers to "unconditional undertakings" the Contract does not contain any wording such as was contained in the pro forma performance bond regarded in Clough as effectively qualifying the terms of the condition precedent stated in the relevant clause. Clough is accordingly distinguishable.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 1101">62 In support of this construction of clause 16.2, the defendant relies on Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2082 in which Gilmour J held:
 

 
 
 
 "[39] If it were the case that, on its proper construction, ONGC could not call on the guarantees until there was an admitted or established breach of contract, the time at which an arbitral tribunal or court might determine that matter could well be after the performance guarantees had expired: cf Ideas Plus Investments at [39] per Steytler P. Such a construction does not, in my view, make commercial common sense: McCann v Switzerland Insurance Australia Limited (2000) 203 CLR 579 at [22] and [23] per Gleeson CJ. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 [40] The performance guarantees secured the Contractor' s 12 month warranty under the Contract. Assume a major defect was discovered by ONGC late in the Warranty period, say only one month prior to expiry of the performance guarantees, but was not acknowledged by Clough as resulting from any failure by it to honour its commitments under the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 136">17 On 21 December 2007, for reasons which he then published, his Honour made orders effectively in terms of the motion.

His Honour made an order on the same day staying the execution of his orders pending the determination of an application for leave to appeal from his judgment: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2082. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 592">44 The rehearing is conducted on the basis that the respondent should have the opportunity to put before the Court any additional material which may suggest that leave ought not to have been granted under O 8 r 3: Bray at [53]; Clough v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [No 3] [2007] FCA 2082 at [12] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 191">1 The applicant, Clough Engineering Ltd, by motion seeks an order granting leave to appeal from a judgment, Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [No 3] [2007] FCA 2082 given on 21 December 2007. The motion is supported by an affidavit of Natalie Jane Wigg sworn 16 January 2008 deposing to the applicant's belief that there are reasonable grounds to appeal. The grounds of appeal are set out in a draft Notice of Appeal dated 16 January 2008. The first respondent, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited ("ONGC") has filed an affidavit sworn on 7 February 2008 by its solicitor Mr Dean Edward Grondal. It contains matters concerning the pending arbitration proceedings commenced in India by Clough against ONGC in which various very substantial claims are made arising from the Construction Contract to which I refer below.
