<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 106">It may be sufficient to enliven the operation of s 47(6) that the condition be attached to the supply of the goods or services at the instigation of a person other than the supplier of the goods, as for example where the condition is imposed at the instigation of the third party from whom the person is required to acquire the other goods or services: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Bill Express (in liq) [2009] FCA 1022 ; (2009) 180 FCR 105 at [61] ; see also the Ku-ring-gai case at 167. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 919">The legislative history demonstrates that Parliament's concern in s 47(6) and s 47(7) was with anti-competitive conduct. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Bill Express Ltd (in liq) [2009] FCA 1022 ; (2009) 180 FCR 105 at [52] ---[56], Gordon J summarised the history of s 47(6) and amendments that have been made to it, referring in particular to the fact that there has been no amendment to import the substantial lessening of competition test into third line forcing, despite repeated consideration and recommendations to the contrary. The Commission contends that this supports its submission, as considered in Heydon's Trade Practices Law , that s 47(6) should not be presumed to be concerned with competition, but may be concerned to protect interests other than or additional to competition. Even if the imposed condition is that goods or services be acquired from other persons who are themselves in sufficient competition such that the condition does not have the effect of substantially lessening competition, this does not preclude a contravention of s 47(6). </sentence>
