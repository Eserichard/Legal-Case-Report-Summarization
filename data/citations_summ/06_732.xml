<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 953">7 Fourthly , the costs in connection with vacating trial dates for the proceeding from 20 March to 27 March 2006, the subject of judgment dated 8 March 2006 ( Norm Engineering Pty Ltd v Digga Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 190) and fifthly , the costs in connection with the applicant's Notice of Motion filed on 7 June 2006 by which the applicant sought further and better discovery from the respondent of particular email correspondence, the subject of judgment on 9 June 2006 ( Norm Engineering Pty Ltd v Digga Australia Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2006] FCA 732). 
  33 On 7 June 2006, the applicant filed a Notice of Motion by which the applicant sought an order for further and better discovery by the respondent of email correspondence containing any comparison between the applicant' s 4 -in-1 bucket, and any other 4-in-1 bucket, and any comment concerning the applicant' s 4 -in-1 bucket. The application was prompted by the applicant's reliance upon an email dated 1 December 2003 from Mr Alan Wade, an employee at that date of the respondent, to Mr Alister Rayner which had recently been provided to the applicant. The email described the development by the respondent of its 4-in-1 bucket, and the taking of all the good points from the applicant' s 4 -in-1 bucket and a bucket made by a company called "Hughes" . The respondent resisted further discovery of emails addressing any such comparison as the notion that the respondent had "access" to the applicant's bucket and "regard" to its features in developing its 4-in-1 bucket was not contested, and thus such documents could not be relevant as the matter was not in controversy. The real question was said to be whether indirect infringement had occurred and that issue fell to be determined on the basis of objective similarity between the three dimensional components and the applicant's two dimensional drawings in suit. However, since objective similarity had to be determined in the contextual circumstances of the case involving the applicant's contention of conscious and deliberate copying, an order was made for the respondent to provide further and better discovery of any emails further describing a comparison of the applicant and respondent' s 4 -in-1 bucket, or other commentary upon the applicant' s 4 -in-1 bucket ( Norm v Digga No 2 [2006] FCA 732). </sentence>
