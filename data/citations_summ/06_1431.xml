However, the applicant adduced no evidence of the damage it allegedly suffered to its reputation by reason of the infringement of its copyright.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1760">124 In this case the applicant has not established any damage by way of loss of sales, loss of reputation or, indeed, any impact whatsoever --- adverse or otherwise --- on the value of its trade mark or otherwise, from the conduct of the first respondent. I have already observed several times throughout this judgment that the activities and customer base of each of the applicant and the first respondent are completely removed from the other. There is scant evidence as to the reputation of the applicant, including in relation to its registered trade mark, and no evidence that its reputation has been affected. Any confusion between the services offered by the applicant and the first respondent was demonstrated to be short-lived and immediately resolved on inquiry. I consider this to be a case where the applicant has shown wrongful conduct by the respondents, but not substantiated any damage arising from that conduct. Accordingly, there is no evidence to warrant compensatory damages or even nominal damages in the absence of quantification of damages (cf The Sanitas Company Ltd v Condy (1887) 4 RPC 530 ; Munday v Carey (1905) 22 RPC 273 ; Paramount Pictures Corporation v Hasluck [2006] FCA 1431 ; (2006) 70 IPR 293 at 302).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 970">36 That brings us to the passing off claims. In its opening submissions, LE 2003 pressed these claims in some detail, on the basis that it intended to seek exemplary damages. Because exemplary damages are not available in trade mark actions ( Paramount Pictures Corporation v Hasluck [2006] FCA 1431 ; (2006) 70 IPR 293 at [34] - [36] ), the claims thus appeared to have some independent relevance. However, despite the promise to address the Court orally regarding exemplary damages, no such oral submissions were forthcoming from counsel for LE 2003. Moreover, LE 2003's written closing submissions make only incidental reference to the passing off claims and no reference at all to exemplary damages. On that basis alone, I conclude that, even if not formally abandoned, the claim was not pressed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 121">As it is inappropriate in this case to apply the "license fee" approach, I will treat the damages as being "at large" in accordance with the authorities set out in Autodesk v Cheung and Fenning Films Services Ltd v Wolverhampton, Walsall &amp; District Cinemas Ltd [1914] 3 KB 1171 at 1174. In pursuing this course, I will attempt to assess the estimated loss of income arising from the infringement as discussed by Tamberlin J in Colombia Pictures Industry Link &amp; Anor v Muckins [1996] FCA 1606 at [13] . To assist this task, I rely on the uncontested evidence of Mark William Crawford who has prepared a report calculating a reasonable license fee and sets out a sum which would be agreed between a winning licensor and licensee in a hypothetical arms length negotiation. I also rely on Nominet UK v Diverse Internet Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1773 ; (2005) 68 IPR 131 ; Paramount Picture Corporation v Hasluck [2006] FCA 1431 ; Led Builders Pty Ltd v Equal Homes Pty Ltd (1999) 44 IPR 24. </sentence>
