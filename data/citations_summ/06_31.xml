<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 715">The Minister's solicitor cited Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [58] , where reference is made to a situation where "the decision-maker was bound by the governing statute to refuse" the substantive application. There is also authority in the Federal Court that relief may be appropriately refused where on uncontested evidence the Tribunal is bound to arrive at the same decision (compare SZECD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 31 ; (2006) 150 FCR 53 at 62, and also Pradabsuk v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 66 ; (2006) 150 FCR 584 at [51] and [54]). The principle is supported in Lee v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 62 ; (2007) 159 FCR 181 at [48] , where it is said: "it must be quite clear that a rehearing or reconsideration is or will be futile" . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 91">

42 In coming to that conclusion, the Federal Magistrate did not accept the conclusion of the single Judge in SZECD [2006] FCA 31 ; 150 FCR 53 that Li was inconsistent with Yilmaz and should not be followed. For the reasons we have given, we have come to the same conclusion. We should observe, however, that the principles of precedent required that the Federal Magistrate follow the decision in SZECD , being a decision of this Court in the appellate jurisdiction from the Federal Magistrates Court. We do not think that it was open to her Honour to regard what was said in SZECD as obiter. In this regard the observations of Lord Simon of Glaisdale in Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd [1976] AC 443 at 478 are apposite, though his Lordship was in dissent. His Lordship said:
 
 It is the duty of the subordinate court to give credence and effect to the [more recent] decision of the immediately higher court, notwithstanding that it may appear to conflict with the [earlier] decision of a still higher court. The decision of the still higher must be assumed to have been correctly distinguished (or otherwise interpreted) in the decision of the immediately higher court. 
 

See also the valuable guidance in this respect in the judgment of Moffitt P in Proctor v Jetway Aviation Pty Ltd [1984] 1 NSWLR 166 , in particular at 177-180. 22 The submissions of the Minister were to the effect that Yilmaz and Li were inconsistent. In SZECD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 31 ; (2006) 150 FCR 53 , a single Judge of this Court (exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Court under the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 25(1A)) was of the same view. In our view, Yilmaz and Li are not inconsistent; rather, they are consistent, if one accepts the premises on which each is founded. 144 Y i lmaz and Li were subsequently considered by Bennett J in SZECD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 31 ; (2006) 150 FCR 53. In SZECD, the appellant had made a second application to the Department for a protection visa, on the basis that the first application had been invalid. The first application had not included any information relating to the appellant's claims for protection and although it referred to "my statutory declaration", no such document was provided to the Department. 74 If there was no valid application and if the Federal Magistrate was wrong in deciding the application on the basis of SZECD [2006] FCA 31 ; 150 FCR 53 , it is still necessary to consider whether relief should be awarded. 
  70 For the reasons already given, we are of the view that SZECD [2006] FCA 31 ; 150 FCR 53 was wrongly decided, and to that extent, not a basis for upholding the Tribunal's decision. 161 The appellant was represented by counsel and solicitors. The appellant contended that the Minister made an error of law in treating the earlier visa application as a valid application under the Act and by reason of that error, failed or refused to exercise jurisdiction. The Minister argued that the first visa application was a valid application because the appellant had made claims before the Tribunal which were considered and determined by it. Any defect in the first visa application was cured by the Tribunal's consideration and determination of the applicant's claims. The Minister relied on the Full Court's judgment in Yilmaz v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 906 ; (2000) 100 FCR 495 and SZECD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 31 ; (2006) 150 FCR 53.  69 The Federal Magistrate concluded that he was bound by SZECD [2006] FCA 31 ; 150 FCR 53 to hold that the supply of Part C to the Tribunal enabled the Tribunal to undertake a "review" of the mother's claims and affirm the decision about the mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 1492">27. He submitted that the Court should consider the decision of SZECD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [10] , and although that decision referred to the Refugee Review Tribunal the submission goes that the RRT was the review body subject essentially in respect of the validity of applications before it, the same statutory regime as the MRT. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 473">Accordingly, it is submitted that the second Tribunal was entitled to rely on a statement the applicant gave the first Tribunal: SZECD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 31 at [32] per Bennett J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 335">Counsel for the First Respondent contended that the Purported Protection Visa Application was a valid application because the Applicant made claims before the Tribunal which were considered and determined by it in the conduct of its review of the delegate's decision refusing the Purported Protection Visa Application. The First Respondent submitted that the provision by the Applicant of his claims to the Tribunal cured any defect in the Purported Protection Visa Application because the Tribunal considered and determined those claims. In support of that proposition, the First Respondent referred the Court to Yilmaz v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 906 ; (2000) 100 FCR 495 (" Yilmaz ") and SZECD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 31 ; (2006) 150 FCR 53 (" SZECD "). 18. The First Respondent submitted that the authorities are relevantly summarised by Bennett J in SZECD and that this Court is bound by the decision in SZECD that consideration by the Tribunal of the Applicant's claims made to the Tribunal cured any invalidity of the Purported Protection Visa Application.</sentence>

 (c) whether the Applicant had otherwise made a declaration to acquire Armenian citizenship. 
 Submissions and reasons 
 
 14. Both counsel appearing in this matter have analysed the case as having conflicting authorities, namely Minister for Immigration v Li [2000] FCA 1456 ; (2000) 103 FCR 486 (" Li ") per Ryan, Sackville and Emmett JJ on one side and SZECD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 31 (" SZECD ") per Bennett J on the other. Mr Foreman for the applicant submits that the conflict should be resolved by preferring the approach in Li . Mr Kennett argues that SZECD discussed conflicting authorities in existence at the time, namely Li on one side and Yilmaz v Minister for Immigration [2000] FCA 906 ; (2000) 100 FCR 495 (" Yilmaz "), Minister for Immigration v Ahmed [2005] FCAFC 58 ; (2005) 143 FCR 314 (" Ahmed ") and Uddin v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCAFC 218 (" Uddin ") on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 45"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] FMCA 1499">In SZECD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 31 at [32] , Bennett J ventured the opinion that a failure to disclose information derived from the reasons of an earlier tribunal decision might constitute a breach of s.424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] FMCA 1472">In SZECD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 31 at [32] , her Honour Bennett J identified the likelihood of jurisdictional error where a second RRT adopted reasoning applied by a first RRT in the same matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2006] FMCA 1348">Indeed, in SZECD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Anor [2006] FCA 31 ; (2006) 227 ALR 656 at [23] - [27], Bennett J found that, after considering the authorities, invalidity of an application before the Delegate is cured upon merits review by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2006] FCA 1172">The second respondent submits that VEAL is distinguishable from the present case on the basis of Bennett J's decision in SZECD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 31 ; [2006] FCA 31 ; (2006) 150 FCR 53. In that decision, Bennett J distinguished the decision in VEAL on the basis that although procedural unfairness had been established in respect of one basis of the Tribunal's decision, there was a separate and independent basis for its conclusion which was not affected by procedural unfairness: see at [28], [40]-[41]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2006] FCA 1110">31 The question, therefore, is whether, as Smith FM suggests, the decision of the Tribunal can be sustained because there is a separate and independent line of reasoning which is not affected by the breach of s 424A(1): see SZECD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 31 ; [2006] FCA 31 ; (2006) 150 FCR 53. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2006] FMCA 568">In the present case there are three other bases upon which the decision may be supported. 
 
 
 15. Mr Johnson submits that support for this line of reasoning is also found in the following decisions: SZECD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 31 at [39] - [41] per Bennett J; SZCJH v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 1660 at [23] per Sackville J; NAUW v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 1086 at [23] - [24] per Moore J; MZWPK v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 1256 at [13] per Heerey J; VEAJ v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCA 678 ; (2003) 132 FCR 291 at [54] - [55] per Gray J. 16. In the fourth ground of the original application filed on 1 June 2005, the applicant claims that the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing was not competent in the Indo/Fijian dialect and the parties experienced communication difficulties.</sentence>
