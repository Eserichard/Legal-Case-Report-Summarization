<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 197">As to the ground of migration agent fraud, it is difficult to assess the merits of this ground in the absence of all the evidence that might be before the court in such proceedings. It is the case that, consistent with the approach taken by the High Court in SZFDE and Others v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2007) 232 CLR 189 ; [2007] HCA 35 , a third party's fraudulent conduct may have the effect of stultifying the operation of the natural justice provisions in Division 4 of Part 7 of the Act where the third party is fraudulent in a way that affects the Tribunal's decision-making process. However where, as in this case, much of the conduct complained of consists of what can be described as omissions, it is relevant to bear in mind that before an omission can be said to have occasioned a fraud on the Tribunal "... it must itself be able properly to be characterised as a fraudulent omission vis-&agrave;-vis the visa applicant " as Jagot J pointed out in SZMWT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2009) 109 ALD 473 ; [2009] FCA 559 at [20] . Further, as was made clear in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLIX and Another (2008) 245 ALR 501 ; [2008] FCAFC 17 at [33] (and also see SZFDE ): The simple fact of a failure to inform or bare negligence or inadvertence will not necessarily be sufficient to give rise to fraud on the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1356">In these circumstances the Court considers that the failure to communicate was unfortunate. The agent certainly had it within his power to inform the Tribunal that he could not contact his client, and it is reasonable to assume the Tribunal might have given more time for the applicant to be contacted had it been requested. It was incumbent upon the agent to take such step when it became apparent to him that he was unable to communicate with his client. It was wholly inadequate for the agent to attempt to rectify the situation after the date of the hearing passed and the decision was handed down. However, even if there was bare negligence or inadvertence on the part of the agent, this has been held not to be sufficient to give rise to a fraud by a migration agent on the Tribunal: see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLIX and Another [2008] FCAFC 17 ; (2008) 245 ALR 501 at [33] . No suggestion of fraud by the agent has been raised in these proceedings, as occurred in SZFDE and Others v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 232 CLR 189 and SZNWT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 559 ; (2009) 109 ALD 473. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 542">In SZMWT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 559 at [21] , it was held that the fact that the applicant signed blank forms did not indicate that he knew about or was complicit in the fraud on the Tribunal. The fraud in that case arose in circumstances where the agent had forged the applicant's signature on the application for review, for the purposes of concealing the agent's involvement, and had said to the applicant: if work rights have been granted you do not need to worry about anything else ... I will look after everything else. </sentence>
