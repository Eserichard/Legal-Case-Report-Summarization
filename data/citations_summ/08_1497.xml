<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 782">Mr Broadfoot supported the Commissioner's conclusion by referring to the passage from the judgment of Jessup J in Lawrence v Commissioner of Taxation : [148] 
 
" ... it is a normal and legitimate part of the fact-finding process to infer what was a person's subjective purpose from circumstances confronting him or her, and from things done by, and statements made by, him or her, in response to those circumstances. " [149]

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 122">74 The Commissioner referred to the decision of Jessup J in Lawrence v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1497 at [105] , suggesting that it was authority for construing s 284-145 as requiring that the purpose be "subjectively determined". He submits that we should not follow it. It is true that his Honour appears to have accepted that the Full Court's decision in Starr [2007] FCAFC 204 ; (2007) 164 FCR 436 established that the test prescribed in s 284-145(1)(b)(i) is "subjective".</sentence>
