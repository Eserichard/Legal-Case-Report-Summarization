<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 482">In my view, the latter disclosure would not have constituted waiver of the privilege in the document, had the document been privileged when it was created. In my view, an inadvertent disclosure of the type which occurred here would not be a disclosure of the character contemplated by s 122 of the Evidence Act and, had I been of the view that the document was privileged, then it would have remained so. Privilege would not have been waived by the inadvertent disclosure of Document 82 during the discovery process. The relevant principles are discussed in Unsworth v Tristar Steering and Suspension Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 1081 at [6] ---[8]; and in CMA Corporation Ltd v Rowe [2010] FCA 1042 at [18] ---[27]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] NSWSC 86">In Unsworth v Tristar Steering and Suspension Australian Limited [2007] FCA 1081 Gyles J was concerned with the inadvertent disclosure of privileged documents during an urgent and complicated process of discovery. A solicitor handed over two privileged documents, believing that they formed part of a group of documents for which privilege could not be claimed. His Honour was referred to Meltend Pty Limited v Restoration Clinics of Australia Pty Limited and other authorities. His Honour dealt with the decision of Hunt CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions v Kane (1997) 140 FLR 468 which, Gyles J said, provided support for the view that a document sent mistakenly or advertently would not be disclosed voluntarily within the meaning of s122 , particularly if the hypothetical reasonable solicitor would have realised that it had been sent by mistake. His Honour referred to the judgment of Sackville J in BT Australasia Pty Limited v State of New South Wales (No.8) (1998) 154 AL 202 at 208 - 209 as supporting the same view. His Honour found that disclosure was inadvertent and that those inspecting the documents must have appreciated, as soon as they appreciated the nature of the documents, the probability of their having been included in the draft bundle by mistake. His Honour held that privilege had not been lost.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] NSWSC 1514">
 

11 In Unsworth v Tristar Steering &amp; Suspension Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 1081 , Gyles J reviewed the authorities, which his Honour considered somewhat conflicting, and concluded (at [9]):
 

 
 
 A single judge of this Court is in a difficult position given the current state of authority. It is not possible to reconcile all of the statements that have been made. However, for the purposes of this case, even if I were to apply the more restricted approach of Goldberg J, I favour maintenance of the privilege. The disclosure was inadvertent in every sense of the word and, in my opinion, an inspecting solicitor (and barrister) must have appreciated the probability of the documents having been included in the draft bundle by mistake as soon as the nature of each of the documents and the contents of them were appreciated. If it be relevant, I find that the solicitors for the respondent so concluded in the absence of evidence to the contrary. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1042">In Unsworth v Tristar Steering and Suspension Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 1081 Gyles J, although drawing attention to the lack of apparent uniformity in some of the authorities, also upheld the maintenance of privilege in a case of inadvertent disclosure. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FamCA 644">Thus, the Court must be satisfied on the material before it that the act was in truth inadvertent. " His Honour went on to describe the circumstances of the case which established inadvertence, namely that even when cross-examined on the documents, the solicitor did not realise that the documents in the exhibit included the documents over which the privilege issue then arose. The decision in Boensch v Pascoe (supra) was considered by Gyles J in Unsworth v Tristar Steering and Suspension Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 1081 , in which Gyles J noted that his Honour's attention was drawn to the decision of Goldberg J in Meltend Pty Ltd v Restoration Clinics of Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 75 FCR 511 , and to which Jacobson J in Boensch v Pascoe (supra), was apparently not referred, and which "...concluded that mere inadvertence or unintentional disclosure in itself is not sufficient to maintain privilege particularly where documents have been inspected" (per Gyles J at paragraph 6). In Meltend Pty Ltd v Restoration Clinics of Australia Pty Ltd (supra) Goldberg J considered (at 526-527) that absent fraud and obvious mistake apparent to the inspecting party: 
"....the appropriate principle to apply is that once inspection has been allowed of a document listed in that part of an affidavit or list in which privilege from inspection is not claimed, any privilege attaching to that document is to be regarded as waived by being included in that part of the affidavit or list and by being made available for inspection. " 
 Gyles J in Unsworth v Tristar Steering and Suspension Australia Ltd (supra) went on to consider the issue as follows:
