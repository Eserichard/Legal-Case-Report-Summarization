<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 73">As we have said, the appellant had access to redacted versions of the documents and chose not to tender them. Had the redacted documents offered no support for the Examiner's decision, then the appellant would probably have tendered them. Instead, he chose to adopt the quite artificial position that such documents were not effectively part of the Examiner's reasons. The appellant's argument implicitly seeks to place upon the respondents the onus of proving that the Examiner's decision was taken in accordance with the ACC Act. He seeks to do so by pointing to the reasons document, excluding the Statement and the Submissions, and submitting that it was for the respondents to make good the alleged deficiencies in that document. However, in reality, the appellant, himself, created the hiatus in the evidence to which he points, by tendering what is, in fact, an incomplete version of the reasons. In the circumstances, no inference adverse to the validity of the Summons can be drawn from the incomplete reasons document. Further, to the extent that the appellant seeks to rely on the decision in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 , he fails for the reasons given by Jagot J in SS v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 580 ; (2009) 256 ALR 474 at [47] . In the absence of the Statement and the Submissions, there is no basis for concluding that the reasons were insufficient. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] NTCCA 4">We were referred to the decision of Jagot J in SS v Australian Crime Commission , [20] where his Honour held that to conclude otherwise would be contrary to the express will of the Parliament as embodied in that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 803">I heard this matter in Darwin on 25 and 26 March 2009. Soon after I reserved my decision in this matter, two judges delivered three decisions on similar and, in some cases, identical, factual and legal issues. They were: SS v Australian Crime Commission (2009) 256 ALR 474 ; [2009] FCA 580 (" SS ") per Jagot J, delivered on 29 May 2009; AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission (2009) 178 FCR 171 ; [2009] FCA 642 (" AA1 ") per Besanko J, delivered on 22 June 2009; and GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759 (" GG ") per Besanko J, delivered on 20 July 2009. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 553">In NTD8, as here, the Statement of Reasons, the Statement of Facts and Circumstances and the Legal Submissions in Support were formulaic and uninformative and did not focus attention on the specific considerations to which the Examiner had regard. Again they seem to bear the hallmarks of a standard form document (see the observations of this Court in NTD8 at [34]; Flick J in AB at [54] and Besanko J in GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759 at [51] ). However, deficiencies of this nature will not necessarily invalidate a notice: see, for example, AB at [59] per Flick J and SS v ACC [2009] FCA 580 at [97] per Jagot J. 
And at [96], the Court said:
 As to the purpose of the reasons, the appellant's essential point was that although the legislation does not provide specifically for a right to reasons for the decision, such a right should be implied by reason of the existence of the right to judicial review of the decision, the terms of s 29(1A) itself, and the requirements of s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act . The submission that the ACC was under an obligation to serve a statement of reasons must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCAFC 4">90 It should also be noted that in AB counsel for the ACC conceded that the content of the obligation in s 29(1A) was informed by s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) (which obliges a decision-maker required to give written reasons for a decision to "set out the findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based"). In this case the respondents made no such concession but asserted --- correctly in our opinion --- that s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act was not engaged by the obligation under s 29(1A) since that requires the examiner to record, but not to 'give', written reasons for the decision. That this is the correct approach is confirmed by decisions about the analogous provision in s 28(1A) of the Act: see Barnes v Boulton [2004] FCA 1219 ; (2004) 139 FCR 356 ; SS v ACC [2009] FCA 580 at [90] ; AA v Board of the ACC [2009] FCA 642 at [30] ; GG v ACC [2009] FCA 759 at [45] .  89 We agree that the sufficiency of the Statement of Reasons was open to criticism. The appellant was correct to draw attention to what counsel described as the 'formulae approach' of the reasons and to the importance of observing the requirements of s 29(1A). As Flick J observed in AB Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 ; (2009) 175 FCR 296 ( AB ) at [54], an observation that was endorsed by this Court in NTD8 at [73], "[t]hose against whom the powers conferred by the 2002 Act are exercised are entitled to have confidence that the power is being lawfully invoked". In NTD8 , as here, the Statement of Reasons, the Statement of Facts and Circumstances and the Legal Submissions in Support were formulaic and uninformative and did not focus attention on the specific considerations to which the Examiner had regard. Again they seem to bear the hallmarks of a standard form document (see the observations of this Court in NTD8 at [34]; Flick J in AB at [54] and Besanko J in GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759 at [51] ). However, deficiencies of this nature will not necessarily invalidate a notice: see, for example, AB at [59] per Flick J and SS v ACC [2009] FCA 580 at [97] per Jagot J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 759">Yet SS's construction would require the CEO to give written notice of the cancellation of the notation to persons both served or otherwise given the summons or notice by the ACC and persons (unknown to the CEO) to whom such a person made disclosure (and so on in accordance with s 29B(4)). 

 
 These considerations indicate that the ACC's submission must be accepted. '"

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 642">I have been able to reach that conclusion largely by a process of construing the relevant provisions of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) ("the ACC Act"). In addition, there are two other matters which have assisted me in reaching the conclusions which I have, and they are matters which will not often be found on an application of this nature. The first is that, as to three of the six grounds of review, very similar points were raised in a case which I heard in March of this year (GG v Australian Crime Commission and Another SAD 176 of 2008). I had the benefit of full submissions on those points in that matter and judgment in the case will be delivered shortly. The second is that, as to two of the six grounds of review, a judge of this Court has considered the substance of those grounds of review and delivered a judgment: SS v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 580 (" SS ").
