<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FCA 311">In Re GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699 , Finkelstein J indicated, at 710 [43], that he did not accept that the power conferred by s 601EE(2) is without restriction. His Honour had a particular reservation about whether it extended to imposing new duties or obligations on any person. However, in light of the language of the sub-section and the authorities cited at [18] above, I consider the power extends at least to the making of orders authorising a representative defendant to explore and provisionally conclude a compromise of litigation affecting the scheme and approving such a compromise if the Court considers it to be in the best interests of the represented persons. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1231">A number of principles were not in dispute. As was stated in paragraph [12] of Letten (No 5) : 
 
 
 ... [Section] 601EE(2) of the Act confers on the Court power "to make any orders it considers appropriate for the winding up of the scheme" (emphasis added). It is a very broad power: Re Stacks Managed Investments Ltd [2005] NSWSC 753 ; [2005] NSWSC 753 ; (2005) 219 ALR 532 and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd [2002] NSWSC 576 ; (2002) 42 ACSR 240 at 243-244 and Mier at [16]. Courts have construed s 601EE(2) of the Act as conferring jurisdiction throughout the course of the winding up: 
 
 

 to make orders to resolve issues that arise in the course of that winding up: see Re GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [42] and the authorities cited; see also Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Atlantic 3-Financial (Aust) Pty Ltd [2003] QSC 386 ; [2004] 1 Qd R 591 at [28] and the authorities cited and Mier at [16];
 to make orders and declarations identifying the scheme property ( Mier at [16]). However, Courts have also held that the Court's statutory and inherent powers do not generally permit it to make orders that depart from the proprietary rights of the scheme participants: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Tasman Investment Management Ltd [2006] NSWSC 943 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 113. 
  That principle has been reiterated in a number of cases and has a sound juridical foundation: Chapter 5C of the Act regulates managed investment schemes: National Australia Bank Ltd v Norman [2009] FCAFC 152 ; (2009) 180 FCR 243 at [118] ; "Managed investment scheme", but not "scheme", is defined in s 9 of the Act. "Scheme property" of a registered scheme is defined broadly in s 9 of the Act. Attempts to define or describe a "scheme" have resulted in a number of formulations (for example, Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Takaran Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 834 ; (2002) 170 FLR 388 at [15] ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [2] , citing Takaran at [16]; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Primelife Corp Ltd [2006] FCA 1072 ; (2006) 235 ALR 328 at [33] ; Norman at [125] --- [126] citing Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v A-G (NSW); Ex rel CAC [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121 at 129; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Enterprise Solutions 2000 Pty Ltd (1999) 33 ACSR 403 ; Knightsbridge Managed Funds [2001] WASC 339 at [45] ). In the end, the statutory definitions that do exist show that a "scheme", in the context of a managed investment scheme, contains some essential elements --- a coherent and defined purpose, in the form of a "programme" or "plan of action", coupled with a series of steps or course of conduct to effectuate the purpose and pursue the programme or plan and a pooling of contributors' funds or of a "common enterprise" as between the contributors. As Keane JA explained in Mier at [26]: 
 
 
 [T]here can be no doubt that the scheme property of an unregistered scheme is to be identified by reference to the terms of the scheme in relation to the contribution of assets to the enterprise involved in the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 1047">Thirdly, s 601EE(2) of the Act confers on the Court power "to make any orders it considers appropriate for the winding up of the scheme" (emphasis added). It is a very broad power: Re Stacks Managed Investments Ltd [2005] NSWSC 753 ; (2005) 219 ALR 532 and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd [2002] NSWSC 576 ; (2002) 42 ACSR 240 at 243-244 and Mier at [16]. Courts have construed s 601EE(2) of the Act as conferring jurisdiction throughout the course of the winding up: to make orders to resolve issues that arise in the course of that winding up: see Re GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [42] and the authorities cited; see also Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Atlantic 3-Financial (Aust) Pty Ltd [2003] QSC 386 ; [2004] 1 Qd R 591 at [28] and the authorities cited and Mier at [16]; to make orders and declarations identifying the scheme property ( Mier at [16]). However, Courts have also held that the Court's statutory and inherent powers do not generally permit it to make orders that depart from the proprietary rights of the scheme participants: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Tasman Investment Management Ltd [2006] NSWSC 943 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 113. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] NSWSC 1087">119 Section 601EE(2) , which provides for the winding-up of unregistered managed schemes, simply authorises the court to make any orders it considers appropriate for the winding-up of a scheme. As was decided in Mier v FN Management Pty Ltd , that power does not authorise the appointment of receivers to property which is not property of a scheme. In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 60 ACSR 447 , Finkelstein J said that that provision did not permit the court to impose new duties or obligations on any person or to alter substantive rights (at 40], [43], [49]). To treat moneys raised by GND by way of unsecured loan and the property acquired through the use of such moneys as property held on trust for all such lenders, and hence scheme property available to be collected by a receiver, is to fashion new interests in property. If such steps could be taken, they would operate to the disadvantage of other creditors of the operator of the scheme.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FCAFC 81">1 This is an appeal from orders of the learned primary judge made on 14 November 2008: Australian Securities and Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in Liq) (No 5) [2008] FCA 1700 (primary judgment). The appeal is brought pursuant to an extension of time granted by Ryan J on 14 May 2009: AVS Property Pty Limited ACN 094 311 645 v Western Retirement Village Management Limited (In Liquidation) ACN 091 443 239 [2009] FCA 512. The issues in the appeal arise from the winding up of an unregistered managed investment scheme known as the Mews Retirement Village (Scheme). Orders for winding up the Scheme and the appointment of receivers were made by the learned primary judge on 28 November 2006: Australian Securities and Investments Commission, in the matter of GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699. The appellant, together with Rental Fleets Australia Pty Ltd held a second registered mortgage over land that was the principal asset of the Scheme (Mews Land). The second mortgage secured funds advanced to the third respondent, Western Retirement Village Management Pty Limited (in liq), pursuant to a facility agreement between the third respondent and AVS. The first registered mortgage was held by National Australia Bank Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] FCA 710">The circumstances in which the question arises for determination are complex. On the application of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC"), the Court has been winding up an unregistered managed investment scheme, pursuant to s 601EE of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), as well as a number of corporations that were involved in that scheme. A convenient summary of the nature of the scheme can be found in the judgment of Finkelstein J in Re: GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd and Ors ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd and Ors [2006] FCA 1415 (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [3]- [5]. The scheme concerned was to involve the establishment of a retirement village, known as the Mews Retirement Village. It is convenient to call the scheme the "Mews Scheme".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] FCA 307">
 
 

 
 7 The Receivers submitted that the orders and directions in [6] above were necessary:
 to enable them to obtain working capital facilities from Westpac to allow the businesses to continue to operate as going concerns and to maintain the operational status quo until the Receivers completed their investigations; to vary the existing orders to allow the Receivers to settle the pre-existing contracts for sale of the "Botanica" townhouses within the Yarra Valley Golf Development; and to enable the Receivers to obtain construction funding for completion of works on some of the "Botanica" apartments and to cover the contingent cost of rental guarantees and other post-settlement obligations specified in the contracts of sale of the apartments. 
 8 Before turning to consider the interlocutory process, it is necessary to restate some principles. First, scheme property is trust property: Re GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [2] , [22] and [47]. Secondly, the principle that trust property should not be mixed applies equally to managed investment schemes: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Enterprise Solutions 2000 Pty Ltd [2001] QSC 82 and generally Charles Pearson Pty Ltd v Attorney-General for the State of Victoria [2006] VSC 260 at [7] ; Conlan v Registrar of Titles [2001] WASC 201 ; (2001) 24 WAR 299 at [272] ; Lupton v White [1808] 15 Ves 432 ; R P Meagher, Jacobs' Law of Trusts in Australia (6 th ed, 1997) at 435. Thirdly, it is only where trust property is so intermixed that it is nearly impossible to trace individual investor's monies and that any attempt to do so would be unlikely to produce a reliable result, that a rateable distribution may be more appropriate: see Enterprise Solutions 2000 Pty Ltd [2001] QSC 82 at [12] and [13].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2010] FCA 207">The Plaintiffs submitted, and I accept, that the Court's power to deal with Mr Georgakis' resignation and the appointment of Mr Nitikins is in s 601EE(2) of the Act. The powers conferred upon the Court are broad. Under s 601EE(2) , the Court has jurisdiction throughout the course of the winding up to make orders to resolve issues that arise in the course of that winding up: see Re GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [42] and the authorities cited; see also Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Atlantic 3 Financial (Aust) Pty Ltd (No.3) [2003] QSC 386 ; [2004] 1 Qd R 591 at [28] and the authorities there cited.

"The action for an account is one of the oldest actions known to the law. It appears to have developed, at common law, as early as the twelfth century as a method to force manorial bailiffs to account to their landowners for money received or income derived from the management of the land. The modern equitable action of account, which has all but superseded the common law action, imposes the duty to account more broadly than the common law. Accounts can be required for purely equitable demands or of legal demands that are ancillary to other equitable relief. "</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] VSC 33">76 A crucial consideration in any application to wind up a scheme is to identify what is to be wound up.

The receivers were directed to sell the principal asset of the scheme, a parcel of land at Lot 4, Railway Parade, Upper Swan, a semi-rural area on the outskirts of Perth (Mews land).

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] FCA 1547">14 In Re GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [43] , Finkelstein J pointed out that the section does not confer substantive obligations. His Honour said:
 43. ...I do not accept that the power conferred by s 601EE(2) is without restriction. In particular, I do not accept that the section permits the court to impose an otherwise nonexistent obligation on a person to provide information to a receiver appointed to wind up a managed investment scheme. It is a well established principle of statutory construction that, in the absence of clearly expressed language to the contrary, courts will presume that legislation is intended to leave individual rights intact. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FCA 1071">17 Approximately one month later, on 18 April 2000, WRVM entered into a contract to sell the Land to The Mews Village Nominees Pty Ltd ("Mews") for $93,425,000 ("the Mews Sale Contract"). On 2 November 2006, Finkelstein J concluded, as a finding of fact, that although WRVM remained the registered proprietor of the Land, it held the Land as bare trustee for Mews: see also Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [4] to [9]. In fact, it was not until 6 December 2007, when the Land was sold pursuant to the orders of Finkelstein J, that WRVM ceased to be the registered proprietor of the Land. 2 The Scheme and its participants were described by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [4] to [10] in the following terms:
 
 
 4. By way of background, the promoters of the [Scheme] described their purpose as being to establish and operate a top-quality resort style retirement village with facilities for respite care. The idea was to develop and sell self-contained and fully serviced units and townhouses to people over the age of 55 years. 49 On 28 November 2006, for the reasons dated 2 November 2006, Finkelstein J ordered the Scheme to be wound up: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699. By paragraph 16 of those orders, his Honour directed the receivers of the Scheme to call for any person claiming any right, title or interest in Land to prove his or her claim by affidavit to be served by 22 December 2006. AVS responded to that direction. The substance of its response was relied upon by WRVM as providing a factual foundation for an estoppel claim in the event that I found each of the components as owing by WRVM to AVS and secured by the AVS mortgage or the AVS charge. In general terms, WRVM submitted that even if the debts were secured, the liquidators and receivers of WRVM had priority because of their reliance on representations made by, or attributable to, AVS. 1 Western Retirement Village Management Pty Ltd ("WRVM") was formerly the registered proprietor of "the Mews" situated at Lot 4, 285 Railway Parade, Upper Swan, Western Australia, being the whole of the land in Certificate of Title Vol 1950 Folio 469 ("the Land"). The Land was the subject of an unregistered investment scheme referred to as "the Mews Village" or "the Mews Retirement Village Scheme" ("the Scheme"), which is in the process of being wound up. Messrs Brian McMaster and Mark Mentha of KordaMentha were appointed receivers of the Scheme to oversee its winding up and were appointed as liquidators of WRVM upon the winding up of WRVM: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699. </sentence>
