<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 33">The Tribunal was conducting an administrative review. Its mandate was to determine whether the decision in its operation in relation to the applicant was fair and reasonable in the circumstances: see, e.g. Vision Super Pty Ltd v Poulter [2006] FCA 849 ; (2006) 154 FCR 185 at 192 (Young J) and National Mutual Life Association of Australia Ltd v Jevtovic [1997] FCA 359 ; (1997) 217 ALR 316 at 321 (Sundberg J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCAFC 8">Mr Edington made a complaint to the Tribunal pursuant to s 14(2) of the Complaints Act, which, as stated above, allows a member of a regulated superannuation fund to complain to the Tribunal that a decision made by the trustee of that fund is unfair or unreasonable. The role of the Tribunal was to decide whether or not the decision made by the Board of Trustees to affirm its previous decision that Mr Edington was not entitled to an insurance benefit for his 21 units was fair and reasonable in relation to him in all the circumstances: see, e.g., Vision Super Pty Ltd v Poulter [2006] FCA 849 ; (2006) 154 FCR 185 at 192 [30] (Young J) and National Mutual Life Association of Australia Ltd v Jevtovic [1997] FCA 359 ; (1997) 217 ALR 316 at 321 (Sundberg J). "Unreasonable" and "unfair" have been said to be "words of broad content", which are not readily defined. The use of synonyms and definitions as interpretational aids has been discouraged: see National Mutual Life Association of Australia Ltd v Campbell [2000] FCA 852 ; (2000) 99 FCR 562 at 571 [36] (Black CJ, Emmett and Hely JJ). </sentence>

 A clear example of a complaint that relates to the management of a fund as a whole would be a complaint concerning the investment policy being adopted by the trustee of the fund. 
 

 
In Vision Super Pty Ltd v Poulter [2006] FCA 849 (2006) 154 FCR 185 , Young J examined more closely the effect of s 14(6). In that case, apparently acting in accordance with a policy, the trustee of the superannuation fund had reduced the entitlements of those of its members who were entitled to deferred benefits, by applying a "negative interest" rate to those entitlements. Young J held that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to deal with the complaints of individual members in relation to those reductions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1515">43 The Court's adoption of a "purposive" approach to the interpretation of statutory instruments, awards and certified agreements has been explained by various courts: Vision Super Pty Ltd v Poulter [2006] FCA 849 ; (2006) 154 FCR 185 at [66] --- [69]; Ansett Australia Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) v Australian Licenced Aircraft Engineers Association [2003] FCAFC 209 at [8] ; Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd (1998) 80 IR 208 at 212 and Hawkins v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (No 2) (1996) 70 IR 213 at 218. In Kucks v CSR Limited (1996) 66 IR 182 at 184, Madgwick J put the point in the following terms:
 
 
 "It is trite that narrow or pedantic approaches to the interpretation of an award are misplaced. The search is for the meaning intended by the framer(s) of the document, bearing in mind that such framer(s) were likely of a practical bent of mind: they may well have been more concerned with expressing an intention in ways likely to have been understood in the context of the relevant industry and industrial relations environment than with legal niceties or jargon.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] SCTA 98">Management of the Fund as a whole 
 
 The Trustee has queried whether issues raised by the Complainant relating to misrepresentation, incompetent management, losses due to fund mergers, investment strategies, the application of discounts the imposition of fees not previously notified, and the charging of excessive fees are matters concerning the management of a fund as a whole, and therefore outside the purview of Tribunal review. Section 14(6) of the Complaints Act is in the following terms:
 
(6) The Tribunal cannot deal with a complaint under this section that relates to the management of a fund as a whole. A recent Federal Court case [1] has reviewed the meaning of "management of a fund as a whole. " Young J noted with approval the following statement of Branson J in an earlier case [2] :
 
It appears that there is no judicial authority on the proper interpretation of s 14(6) of the [Complaints Act]. It seems clear, however, that the subsection is concerned with the nature of the complaint made under the section, rather than with the nature of the determination reached by the Tribunal on that complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] SCTA 66">However, the Tribunal is satisfied that it has jurisdiction to determine this complaint, as the Complainant's concerns relate not only to the calculation by the Trustee but the communication of that information to the Complainant and, as such, does not relate to management of the Fund as a whole. [1] 
 TRUST DEED
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] SCTA 154">It is arguable that the Trustee's calculation of the exit fee and surrender value of the Complainant's policy could be considered as beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the basis that they relate to management of the fund as a whole (contrary to s14(6) of the Complaints Act ). However, the Tribunal is satisfied that it has jurisdiction to determine this complaint, as the Complainant's concerns relate not only to the calculation by the Trustee but the communication of that information to the Complainant and, as such, does not relate to management of the fund as a whole. [1] 
 
 TRUST DEED
 
 The version of the trust deed relevant to the complaint is the one in effect at the time that the policy commenced (ie 14 February 1980), as amended to and including the amendment dated 10 December 1996 ('Trust Deed'). There appears to be no dispute between the parties that relates to any provisions of the Trust Deed. POLICY 
 
The life insurance policy relevant to the complaint is the policy executed by the Trustee and the Insurer in favour of the Complainant commencing on 14 February 1980 and amended in 1993 and 2001 ('Policy').</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] AATA 710">" [574] 
 
 
The ordinary meanings are consistent with the interpretation of the word by Farwell J in Bond v Barrow Haematite Steel Co : [575] 
 
" Interest is not an apt word to express the return to which a shareholder is entitled in respect of shares paid up in due course and not by way of advance. Interest is compensation for delay in payment and is not accurately applied to the share of profits of trading, although it may be used as an inaccurate mode of expressing the measure of the share of those profits. " [576] 
 
 
335. The words the Trust Deed chooses to use in cl 17(i)(1) can be compared with those it chooses to use in relation to the calculation of lump sum benefits provided to Category F Members. Various options are presented but two of them provide for regard to be had to the Member's Contributions " ... together with interest thereon to the date of payment at the rate of 6.5% per annum compounded with yearly rests until the 30 th day of June 1987 and thereafter at a rate determined from time to time by the Trustees having regard to the advice of the Actuary or such other person who in the opinion of the Trustee is suitably qualified to provide such advice.</sentence>
