<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 950">It is not every non-compliance with a given provision in an industrial instrument that will expose that party to the imposition of a penalty. Some provisions may be characterised as hortatory or merely reflective of a desirable policy or end without necessarily attracting penal consequences. Other provisions may be best characterised as facilitative in nature when one has regard to their operation in a practical industrial relations context: Reeves v MaxiTRANS Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 970 at [19] ; Bell v Minister for Health [2006] FCA 134 at [20] . (4) Section 719(1) of the WR Act confers a discretion on an eligible court (such as this Court) to impose a penalty in accordance with Part 14 Division 2 on a person if:
 
(a) the person is bound by an applicable provision; and
 
(b) the person breaches the provision. (5) The chosen language of "breaches" employed in s 719(1)(b) directs attention to the well established doctrine of statutory interpretation which recognises a clear dichotomy between:
 
(a) on the one hand, true breaches which found a conclusion of invalidity or liability; and
 
(b) on the other hand, a mere non-compliance with a given provision which does not give rise to invalidity or liability, or which otherwise has some lesser consequence at law.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 970">As Tracey J remarked in Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Limited [2009] FCA 597 , at [40]; 
 The terms in which industrial instruments are drafted often require a distinction to be drawn between aspirational and promissory statements. In accordance with the objective theory of contract expounded in Toll [(FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 ] a provision in a document proffered by an employer, will be treated as promissory in nature if the hypothetical, reasonable, potential employee to whom the document is presented would have concluded that [the employer] intended to be contractually bound to follow the procedures, outlined in it... 

 
The same is true of provisions which are merely "facultative". This point has been made, in the context of a rostering system operating in "a practical industrial relations context", by Marshall J in Bell v Minister for Health [2006] FCA 134 ; see esp. at [20]. A similar understanding informed the observation of a Full Bench of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission (Sir John Moore P, Madden J and Brown C) in the Termination Change and Redundancy Case (1984) 8 IR 34 at 52 that;
 
 We are aware that procedures for notification, consultation and provision of information have generally been settled by negotiation and agreement and we are of the view that, generally speaking, they are not matters which lend themselves to effective legislation or award prescription.</sentence>
