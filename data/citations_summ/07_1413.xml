<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 99"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1259">The findings of fact that the Tribunal makes are those that it, rather than the claimant, let alone adversarial parties, considers to be necessary for it to make its decision. Those findings, therefore, cannot be treated as a determination of some question identified in any way that is distinct from the particular process of reasoning which the Tribunal adopts in reaching its decision. See also: NBKM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 at [25] ---[28] per Siopsis J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 138">38 It follows from the foregoing that NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 was wrongly decided. I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles. Associate:

Dated: 1 August 2008


 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 834">The authorities appear to be (amongst others) SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 98 ALD 567 ; [2007] FCA 1100 (" SZHLM ") and possibly SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 941 , on the one side, and NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 (" NBKM ") and SZJHL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1713 (" SZJHL "). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 786">During the course of the hearing, Mr Mitchell fairly (given that the applicant was unrepresented before the Court) raised one possible issue that the Court should consider in light of SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 (" SZILQ ") at [32], SZHLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 (" SZHLM ") at [34], and NBKM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 (" NBKM ") at [32]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 679">The authorities relied on by the Minister are: NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 (" NBKM ") at [25]-[27], a case similar to the situation in the case before the Court now. Upon remittal the Tribunal sent the applicants a " s.424A " letter, but did not invite them to a hearing. The Minister specifically referred the Court to NBKM at [30]-[32]: "30 In this case, the ambit of the potential issues before the Tribunal as originally constituted was defined by claims made by the appellants, as contained in the materials which were provided to the Tribunal immediately prior to the first hearing, and the evidence given at the first hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCAFC 84">9 Given that the appellant's case was remitted to the Tribunal for a further hearing, an issue might have arisen as to whether it was necessary for the Tribunal to issue a further invitation under s 425 to attend a hearing. We are inclined to the view that no such invitation was required; see NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 at [15] - [32] and SZJHL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1713 at [16] ; cf SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 ; [2007] 98 ALD 567 at [34] . It is not necessary for us to decide that question however as the appellant was invited to the second hearing and did attend. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 712">25 (v) As it is the Tribunal which continues to conduct the particular review consequent upon a remitter, the steps taken by the Tribunal to discharge its statutory obligations under s 424A and s 425 in the conduct of that review prior to the making of an invalid decision may, but need not necessarily, be a sufficient discharge of those statutory obligations for the purpose of making a subsequent and valid decision on the review: SZEPZ (on s 424A); SZILQ (on s 425); and also NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413. Thus, a s 424A notice or a s 425 invitation given prior to the Tribunal's invalid decision may, or may not, suffice without a further notice or invitation depending upon whether on the remitter the circumstances then are such that s 424A or s 425 does or does not require, according to their respective terms, a fresh notice or invitation.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 452">Since the hearing of this matter, it has come to the Court's attention that there have been three recent additions which address the issue of whether a reconstituted Tribunal is required to hold its own hearing. This issue was addressed in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 per Buchannan J at [32] handed down on 27 June 2007: SZHLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 per Cowdry J at [34] handed down on 23 October 2007 and NBKM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 per Siopis J at [32] handed down 13 September 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 228">During the hearing in this Court, I raised with Mr Mitchell the impact of the recent decisions in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 at [32] per Buchannan J, SZHLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 at [34] per Cowdroy J and NBKM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 at [32] per Siopis J. At the end of the hearing leave was granted to the parties to file supplementary submissions addressing this issue. Mr Mitchell complied with this request and filed supplementary submissions on 12 December 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 219">Counsel for the First Respondent referred the Court to SZEQX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 2091 (" SZEQX ") in which I considered SZHLM and other relevant authorities in relation to the issue. There is authority to suggest that the Act requires the Tribunal to conduct a valid review and make a decision according to law; and, until the Tribunal has made a valid decision, the review is continuing ( SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 (" SZEPZ "); NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 (" NBKM "); Liu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1362 ; (2001) 113 FCR 541 (" LIU ")). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 163">I am not persuaded by either of those contentions. The issue of the requirement of a fresh hearing upon a remitted review was dealt with by Siopis J in the decision of NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) FCA 1413. His Honour at [23] of that judgment relies upon an earlier decision of Liu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) FCA 1362 in establishing that there is no absolute right to a hearing before the Tribunal member who decides the review. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FMCA 2091">In NBKM &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 (" NBKM ") Siopis J stated at [25] "there is no absolute right to a second hearing when a matter is remitted to the tribunal for hearing according to law" . Nor is there any right to a hearing before the Refugee Review Tribunal member who decides the review ( Liu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1362 ; (2001) 113 FCR 541 ; NBKM at [23]-[24]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FMCA 2037">In an appeal from Scarlett FM's judgment in NBKM (supra) which was cited by the present Tribunal, Siopis J accepted that a previous hearing might exhaust the obligations of s.425. However, he added a qualification. In NBKM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 , he said: 25 The second but related issue is whether in the circumstances of this case, a second hearing was required. It does not follow that because there is no absolute right to a second hearing when a matter is remitted to the Tribunal for hearing according to the law, that there will never be circumstances when the Tribunal will be required to invite an applicant to a second hearing, in order to comply with s 425(1). Section 425(1) requires the Tribunal to invite an applicant to appear before a Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review". 26 Whether such requirement arises will depend upon what the "issues arising in relation to the decision under review" are, at the time the Tribunal makes the second decision.
