<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VCAT 1364">The scope of the word "services" used in similar contexts, has been given a wide meaning [1] . There has been an emphasis on looking at whether the services are an "act of helpful activity" or there is some "action of supplying, helping or benefiting conduct tending to the welfare or advantage of another". [2] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] NSWADT 308">133 It is unnecessary for present purposes to consider authority on the question of when there will be a relevant " refusal " in the provision of services under a statutory power: see IW v City of Perth (1996) 191 CLR I at 24 and 45; and Ferneley v Boxing Authority of New South Wales [2001] FCA 1740 ; (2001) 115 FCR 306 at [50] and [60]; compare AB v Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages ( [2006] FCA 1071 ; 2006) 235 ALR 147 at 158 [64] - [66] ; also AB v Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages [2007] FCAFC 140 ; (2007) 162 FCR 528 per Black CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCAFC 140">28 In argument before the trial judge the parties made submissions as to whether the relevant service here was the Registrar's consideration of an application, or the actual changing of the sex recorded on the birth registration. I agree with the trial judge that those arguments introduced "an unnecessary degree of subtlety into a simple process" (see [2006] FCA 1071 at [64] ) because this case is much simpler, in this respect, than IW v City of Perth . The Registrar was not here exercising a deliberative function as the Council was in IW v City of Perth ; the Registrar does not exercise any discretion, he or she simply assesses the application against the factual criteria in s 30A of the Victorian Act. In this respect the present case is much more like the cases discussed with approval by Brennan CJ and McHugh J in the following passage from their joint judgment in IW v City of Perth (at 13):
 
 [I]n Attorney-General (Canada) v Cumming , Thurlow A-CJ accepted that in assessing taxes under the Income Tax Act the Department of National Revenue was engaged in the provision of services within the meaning of s 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act . Similarly, in Savjani v Inland Revenue Commissioners , the English Court of Appeal decided that the Inland Revenue was providing "services" to the public in carrying out a statutory duty to determine whether a taxpayer was entitled to a deduction for a dependent child and in disseminating and giving advice to taxpayers to enable them to claim that tax relief. (footnotes omitted) 
 

The same cases are discussed by Gummow J at 42-43.  &#8226; The obligations under the Convention were confined to acting and refraining from acting in relation to disadvantage suffered by women as compared with men. &#8226; The Convention did not deal with marital status discrimination per se but with discrimination against women because of their marital status. &#8226; Section 22 of the SDA was "not ... a step along the way to some greater goal concerned with discrimination against women only": AB v Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages [2006] FCA 1071 at [57] per Heerey J. In so far as s 22 concerned stereotypes, it was a stereotype that might arise from a person being married, or unmarried, irrespective of sex. At [59]-[60] of his reasons, his Honour said:
 Section 9(10) speaks of 'giv[ing] effect to the Convention'.</sentence>
