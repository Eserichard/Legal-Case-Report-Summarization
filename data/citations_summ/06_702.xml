<citances>
<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 707">The applicant did not seek any adjournment of the hearing to enable him to receive any legal advice. In any event, it is the case there is no entitlement to seek legal advice in the circumstances ( SZHTI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 702 per Gyles J at [4]), particularly as the applicant had already been given a reasonable opportunity in this regard. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 92">The applicant has been on notice since that time that a final hearing was set down for today. I note also that the applicant applied to access the "RRT Legal Advice Scheme". It is not clear whether the applicant consulted a lawyer. From the information on the Court's file, some advice was sent to the applicant by a lawyer on that panel who had been assigned to advise the applicant. There is of course no legal entitlement to the receipt of such advice ( SZHTI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 702 at [4] per Gyles J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 1025">For the sake of completeness, given how this case has proceeded before this Court, I note that there is no entitlement to accessing the Court's "RRT Legal Advice Scheme". I note this just in case that is also what the applicant seeks to complain about in his document. (See SZHTI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 702 per Gyles J at [3] to [4], a matter on appeal from this Court ( SZHTI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 41). ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 512">I refer to the judgment of Driver FM in SZHTI &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 41 , where his Honour said that procedural fairness does not necessitate access to the Legal Advice Scheme (at [8]), which was upheld on appeal ( SZHTI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 702 at [4]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 1186">Finally, I am guided by what was said in SZHTI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 702 , a matter on appeal from this Court, per Gyles J, particularly at [3] to [4]: "3 The first paragraph of the affidavit in support of the application is: 'I was not given access to free legal advice which is commonly available to applicants through the NSW Legal Advice Scheme. I was denied natural justice at the Federal Magistrates Court. ' 4 That contention was put to the learned Federal Magistrate and, in my opinion there is no doubt about the correctness of the view he expressed that there is no right to free legal advice and that the fact that an adjournment was not granted to access free legal advice was not a denial of natural justice. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 889">Ms Mitchelmore opposed the adjournment. She submitted that the mere fact that the panel lawyer had not had an opportunity to listen to an audio tape of the Tribunal hearing is not a sufficient reason to grant an adjournment. She relied on SZHTI &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 41 , and on appeal SZHTI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 702 per Giles J (" SZHTI "). See, in particular, [4]: "That contention was put to the learned Federal Magistrate and, in my opinion there is no doubt about the correctness of the view he expressed that there is no right to free legal advice and that the fact that an adjournment was not granted to access free legal advice was not a denial of natural justice. " In the circumstances of the current case, it appears that the applicant had received some advice, albeit incomplete advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 641">18 Although the absence of legal advice had not been raised as a ground of appeal in this Court (as it had in the Federal Magistrates Court), Mr Snell pointed to the decision of SZHTI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 702. In that decision, Gyles J said:
 2 This is an application seeking leave to appeal against orders and judgment of Federal Magistrate Driver dated 19 January 2006 (SZHTI &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 41) dismissing an application for judicial review on the grounds that it failed to disclose an arguable case for the relief claimed pursuant to r 44.12 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules. The affidavit in support of the application for leave to appeal has two paragraphs. The draft notice of appeal attached to the affidavit repeats the substance of those two grounds. 3 The first paragraph of the affidavit in support of the application is: 
 
 I was not given access to free legal advice which is commonly available to applicants through the NSW Legal Advice Scheme. I was denied natural justice at the Federal Magistrates Court. 
 
 4 That contention was put to the learned Federal Magistrate and, in my opinion there is no doubt about the correctness of the view he expressed that there is no right to free legal advice and that the fact that an adjournment was not granted to access free legal advice was not a denial of natural justice. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FMCA 2099">Whatever the case, regardless of whether the applicant did try to contact the panel lawyer, whether the panel lawyer sent advice, and whether that advice was sent to an address at which the applicant was able to retrieve the letter, it is well established that, and as submitted by Mr Mitchell, there is no right to obtain such legal advice. I note reference to various authorities by Mr Mitchell (matter of Dietrich v R (1992) 177 CLR 292 ; [1992] HCA 57 and SZHTI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 702) , in support of the proposition that was submitted. I also agree with submissions by Mr Mitchell that there is some obligation on an applicant who has come to this country and as the applicant stated: "Is afraid that he will be killed if he is returned. " 
This is an obligation to at least take some steps to at least show some diligence in pursuing those matters which would assist him in obtaining the protection which he says is so vital to not only his liberty, but indeed to his life. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FMCA 1671"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCA 1213">23 The second ground complains that the applicant was not given free legal advice. The applicant was sent a referral for advice on 8 March 2007. However procedural fairness does not necessitate access to the panel advice scheme and the legal panel advice scheme cannot and should not prevent the timely disposal of cases before the Court: SZHTI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 41 at [8] upheld on appeal in SZHTI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 702. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2006] FMCA 1690">As Gyles J said in SZHTI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 702 at [4] : 
 
 
 ... there is no right to free legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2006] FMCA 845">As has recently been confirmed by the Federal Court on appeal, procedural fairness in hearings before this Court do not depend upon applicants receiving advice under the Panel Advice Scheme [3] .</sentence>
