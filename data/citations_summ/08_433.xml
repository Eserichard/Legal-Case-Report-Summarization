<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] NSWSC 1058">24 Immediately before deregistration, however, Rigby Jones was subject to members voluntary winding up. A liquidator was in office. If and when reinstated, the company will again be a company in liquidation. However, the person who was the liquidator at the time of deregistration will not resume office as liquidator upon reinstatement: see J P Morgan Portfolio Services Ltd v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu [2008] FCA 433 ; (2008) 65 ACSR 636 and cases there discussed. It will be necessary, therefore, that a liquidator be appointed. This is another aspect of stewardship.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1181">6 Section 509(5) of the Corporations Act provided that ASIC must deregister a company at the end of a period three months after the liquidator lodges with ASIC a return of the holding of the final meeting. Mr Green filed that return on 23 May 2005. ASIC deregistered JHAF on 23 August 2005. As noted earlier, upon deregistration JHAF ceased to exist. Clearly, Mr Green is no longer in office as its liquidator. It is therefore not quite appropriate to speak of his being "replaced". Although I reached this view before becoming aware of Stone J's decision in JP Morgan Portfolio Services Ltd v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu [2008] FCA 433 ; (2008) 167 FCR 212 , I note that it is totally in conformity with her Honour's.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 962">5 Mr Fernon SC, who appears this morning for the plaintiffs, has referred me to a line of authorities which reveals the dispute. I do not intend to record what was said in those authorities, but the cases and relevant paragraphs are: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2000] NSWSC 316 ; (2000) 174 ALR 688 at [50] ; Ramantanis v G and M Excavations; v I and M Excavations [2003] NSWSC 1250 at [7] to [8]; Murray Halstead v CTS Quality Building Products Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] NSWSC 1022 at [12] ; JP Morgan Portfolio Services Limited v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu [2008] FCA 433 ; (2008) 65 ACSR 636 at [7] -[8], and [10]. With the exception of the decision of Austin J in ACCC v ASIC , these authorities support the proposition that on registration of a company, the liquidator who was in office at the time of deregistration is not automatically reinstated. </sentence>
