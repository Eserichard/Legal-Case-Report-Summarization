<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 1194">11 Any cross-claim under the Property (Relationships) Act would be hopeless, as with effect from her bankruptcy Ms Morkaya has no property capable of being subject to an order [ DCT v Swain [1988] FCA 238 ; (1988) FLC 91-976 ; Macks v Edge [2006] FCA 1077 ; Page v Page (No 2) (1982) FLC 91-241]. There is no provision in the Act equivalent to Family Law Act , s 79(1), enabling continuation of property adjustment proceedings after bankruptcy; and while the provisions of the Family Law Act apply to de facto relationships which ended after 1 March 2009, they do not apply to this relationship. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1383">1. First, Mr Griffin QC for the respondent submitted that if the trustee is successful in the substantive proceedings the respondent will make an application in the Family Court under s 79(1) of the Family Law Act seeking an order altering the interests of the trustee in the relevant property of Mr Jensen. As Besanko J observed in Macks v Edge [2006] FCA 1077 ; (2006) 156 FCR 302 at [42] , the Federal Court can hear and determine the trustee's claim, but it cannot hear and determine a spouse's claim under the Family Law Act should it become necessary to do so. Since judgment was delivered in Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen [2009] FCA 778 it has become clear that: there are other potential claims against the respondent by the trustee, including the s 139ZQ notice concerning the property the subject of the respondent's Cross-Claim; and the respondent has subsequently commenced proceedings in the Family Court seeking declarations in relation to the financial agreement.  2. Second, Mr Holt, the solicitor for the respondent, has deposed that the respondent's costs of defending the claim in these proceedings in the Federal Court will exceed $120,000 for a five day trial, and would constitute a similar amount in separate Family Court proceedings (affidavit of Richard Bruce Holt affirmed 24 September 2009). Mr Holt deposes further that the applicant's costs would be the same, and that in the circumstances both parties stand to save over $100,000 in costs each if the two actions are heard together in the Family Court. Although the trustee claims that if the proceedings are transferred to the Family Court he will have incurred wasted costs: the trustee does not dispute the evidence of Mr Holt concerning potential savings if these proceedings are transferred to the Family Court. Cost savings for the parties is an issue relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion under s 35A (cf Sutherland [2000] FCA 463 at [8] ); the respondent has already commenced proceedings in the Family Court; if the trustee is successful in these proceedings it is very likely for reasons I have already outlined that the interests of the trustee and the respondent in relevant property will be subject to review by the Family Court; while these proceedings have been on foot for almost two years and it is only now that the respondent has filed a notice of motion seeking an order that the proceedings be transferred to the Family Court, in fact the pleadings have not yet closed. Unlike in Macks v Edge [2006] FCA 1077 ; (2006) 156 FCR 302 , these proceedings are not nearly ready for hearing; the trustee's complaint that he will need to engage both new solicitors and new counsel if the matter is transferred to the Family Court is, with respect, unpersuasive in the broader context of the requirements of the justice of the case.  The question whether bankruptcy-related proceedings should be transferred from the Federal Court to the Family Court has been considered in a number of cases by this Court. So, for example, the respondent has drawn my attention to the following cases: In re Sabri; ex parte Sabri v Brien (1995) 60 FCR 131 Davies J held that the proceedings should be transferred to the Family Court because there was a possibility of conflict between potential orders of the Federal Court and the Family Court, and also because there was an issue concerning a possible equitable interest of the wife in relevant property with which the Family Court could properly deal. In re Sharpe ex parte Powell v Donnelly [1996] FCA 896 Lindgren J found that issues of efficiency and economy of judicial administration resulted in the case being appropriate to transfer, in light of the fact that issues touching the nature and extent of the assets and liabilities, income and expenditure of the husband required determination in the Family Court. In Sutherland, in the matter of Khanafer [2000] FCA 463 Madgwick J ordered the proceedings be transferred to the Family Court notwithstanding that the application was made by the non-bankrupt wife three days before the matter was listed for hearing in the Federal Court. In that case his Honour was persuaded that in the circumstances it would be reasonable for the Family Court to determine issues as to the reasonableness of the marital property settlement between the parties, and that costs would be lower if the matter was determined in the Family Court. In Official Trustee in Bankruptcy, the Trustee of the Property of Phillip Martin Higgins v Higgins [2000] FCA 1850 Tamberlin J ordered that the proceedings be transferred to the Family Court in order to avoid a situation where the an order of the Federal Court might conflict with an earlier order of the Family Court under s 79A of the Family Law Act . His Honour took the view that the fact that there were no existing proceedings in the Family Court was no reason not to order a transfer of proceedings to that Court. In Macks v Edge [2006] FCA 1077 ; (2006) 156 FCR 302 Besanko J refused to order that the proceedings be transferred to the Family Court on the basis that the proceedings were nearly ready for hearing in the Federal Court, and the Family Court claim in that case was contingent upon their outcome. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 778">The facts in Macks v Edge [2006] FCA 1077 ; (2006) 156 FCR 302 were more similar to those in contention before me. In that case a husband and wife entered an oral "separation agreement" by which the husband agreed to transfer his interest in property to the wife. The agreement was entered in or about September 2002. In summary, I do not take the view that the Federal Court, in which the applicant commenced substantive proceedings, is the "wrong court" in this case, for the same reasons as those given by Besanko J in Macks v Edge --- namely that the Family Court has jurisdiction to alter the trustee's rights with respect to vested bankruptcy property, but this Court retains jurisdiction to determine the prior question of whether the transfer pursuant to the financial agreement was void because it falls within the provisions of s 120 or s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act ( Macks v Edge [2006] FCA 1077 ; (2006) 156 FCR 302 at 312). This approach is echoed in observations of Wilcox J in Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217 (at 237-238). It is not necessary for the applicant to apply to the Family Court to have the financial agreement between Mr Jensen and the respondent terminated as a necessary element of an application to have the transfer of the Carrara property set aside pursuant to s 120 and s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act .  If the transfer to the respondent of the interest in the matrimonial home is to be set aside, the whole matter will have to be reviewed, and that review can only occur in the Family Court. To hold otherwise runs contrary to Mateo . In Macks v Edge [2006] FCA 1077 ; (2006) 156 FCR 302 Besanko J declined to transfer proceedings by a trustee under s 120 and s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act to the Family Court but primarily because of the lateness of the application. His Honour reached no conclusion as to any of the legal issues involved. The decision of Ryan J in Rambaldi (as Trustee of Bankrupt Estate of Volkov) v Volkov [2008] FCA 1957 is authority for the proposition that if a trustee in bankruptcy seeks to utilise s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act in the context of any existing financial agreement, the trustee needs to confront the financial agreement itself. I consider that similar principles apply in the case before me. Whether the "transfer" in this case was the creation of an equitable interest in the Carrara property in favour of the respondent, or the actual transfer effected by the form 1 (an issue I need not resolve for the purposes of this notice of motion) the transfer can nonetheless be the subject of challenge pursuant to s 120 or s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act without the applicant being required to make application to set aside the financial agreement executed by Mr Jensen and the respondent. I consider that this approach is consistent with the findings of this Court in Macks v Edge [2006] FCA 1077 ; (2006) 156 FCR 302 and Rambaldi [2008] FCA 1957 , as well as the Full Court in Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217. </sentence>
