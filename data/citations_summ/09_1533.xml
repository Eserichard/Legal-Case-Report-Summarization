<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 372">However, as deterrence is the primary objective of penalties, the financial capacity of a respondent to pay must not prevent the Court from doing its duty even if in some cases, the penalty is so high that the offender will become insolvent: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v High Adventure Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 247 ; (2006) ATPR 42-091 at [11] . Put another way, I accept that capacity to pay is a relevant factor, but one of "less importance when balanced against the necessity of imposing a penalty that satisfies the objective of general deterrence": Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (No 6) [2009] FCA 1533 at [28] and Leahy Petroleum (No 2) [2005] FCA 254 at [9] and [11]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1383">As to penalty I have, in respect of other respondents, earlier had occasion to canvass considerations which I regard as relevant to the imposition of penalties under the Spam Act : see Australian Communications and Media Authority and Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (No 4) [2009] FCA 1225 ; (2009) 180 FCR 467 and Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated In Hong Kong (No 6) [2009] FCA 1533. I do not propose to rehearse all which I have stated in those earlier reasons for judgment as to principles applicable in relation to the imposition of penalty. Suffice it to say, I have taken into account the principles which I have set out, particularly those in the No 4 judgment. Therefore, these reasons for judgment should also be read in conjunction with the discussion of principle, in the No 4 and No 6 judgments. Those judgments are also pertinent, in terms of penalties which have been imposed on other respondents, in respect of contraventions, either corporate or accessorial, of the Spam Act . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1565">There have now been three judgments of the Court in respect of contraventions of s 16 (among other provisions) of the Spam Act . They are, Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377 per Nicholson J; Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (No 4) [2009] FCA 1225 ; (2009) 261 ALR 326 per Logan J; and a further ex tempore judgment by Logan J on 16 December 2009 concerning further respondents in the Mobilegate litigation ( Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd (No 6) [2009] FCA 1533). </sentence>
