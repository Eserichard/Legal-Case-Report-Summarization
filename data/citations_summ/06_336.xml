<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 88">
 

42 The same complaints have been put and rejected on three previous occasions by judges of this Court. Justice Merkel rejected the argument: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 2) [2006] FCA 336. Justice Tracey first rejected the argument in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 4) [2006] FCA 1339. He rejected the argument for the second time at the trial of this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1608">27 I refused Mr Siminton's application. Similar strike-out applications had been made to Merkel J on 30 March 2006 and to me on 18 October 2006. Those applications had been supported by substantially the same arguments and, in both cases had been rejected: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 2) [2006] FCA 336 ; Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 5) [2006] FCA 1340. There was no substance to the argument advanced in support of the permanent stay applications when they were first made. It was not improved by repetition. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 262">Additionally the first and second respondents make the submission that any challenge to interlocutory orders (by reference to the Court's power to do so) should not be relied upon as a substitute for an appeal and, if so, the challenge should be refused as it is a misuse of process: Merkel J in Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority v Siminton (No 2) [2006] FCA 336 at [5] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 1398">Tracey J ordered that Mr Siminton's application be dismissed with costs on 6 October 2006. His Honour gave reasons for that decision in the form of a "ruling" delivered on that same day: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v David Robert Siminton (No 4) [2006] FCA 1339. He noted that a number of the matters raised by Mr Siminton had been agitated before another judge of this Court, Merkel J, earlier this year: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 2) [2006] FCA 336. However, Tracey J also noted that Mr Siminton had raised what his Honour described as a "novel complaint", namely that the proceeding had been brought unconstitutionally because it was said to provide for the acquisition of Mr Siminton's property by APRA, or the Commonwealth, without just terms. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 1339">As I have already indicated, a number of these matters were agitated before another judge earlier in the year. Justice Merkel dealt with these matters on 30 March 2006 and his reasons for judgment appear as Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 2) [2006] FCA 336. The application to his Honour to strike out various orders made earlier by Sundberg J, Gray J and himself were all rejected, as too were a strike out application in relation to the statement of claim and an application to stay the proceeding until after the determination of what were described as 'criminal activities', alleged to appear in the statement of claim. His Honour rejected all of these grounds.
