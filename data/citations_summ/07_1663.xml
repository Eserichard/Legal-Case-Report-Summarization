<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 88">106 Neither party came to make anything of Comcare v Burgess [2007] FCA 1663 ; (2007) 164 FCR 66 on the basis that it was concerned with the construction of s 8(10)(a) of the SRC Act, not s 8(10)(b), and was for this reason alone distinguishable. 94 The Tribunal considered that its preferred construction was supported by an approach to the construction of s 8(10(a) of the SRC Act adopted by Greenwood J in Comcare v Burgess [2007] FCA 1663 ; (2007) 164 FCR 66 at [26] . His Honour there concluded that the continuity of employment contemplated by s 8(10)(a) of the SRC Act was a "continuity of service and receipt of earnings not simply a subsisting employer/employee relationship". The Tribunal opined (Reasons, para 33), "Similarly, ... s 8(10)(b) of the Act contemplates the possibility of the continuity of service and receipt of earnings in the employment in which the employee had been engaged at the time of the injury. " As I have observed, this matter is no longer in dispute. The Tribunal then accepted Mr Robertson's submission that as s 8(10) did not expressly contemplate a situation in which the employment of a relevant employee was terminated upon completion of a project, s 8(10) was not engaged. This conclusion was said to be consistent with the decision of Greenwood J in Comcare v Burgess [2007] FCA 1663 ; (2007) 164 FCR 66. At paras 33 to 35, the Tribunal concluded that:
 
 
 33 It is, I think, preferable to construe s 8(10) of the Act as being confined to situations where it is possible to say that an injured employee could have continued to be employed by the Commonwealth or a licensed corporation. Viewed that way the subsection operates to reduce the entitlement to compensation in line with the reality of the fact of continued employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 443">The first argument, that s 8(10) of the Act was not engaged, appears to derive its inspiration from the decision of Greenwood J in Comcare v Burgess [7] . There the applicant had been suspended without pay some time after suffering an incapacitating injury. Comcare had relied upon the fact of that suspension to determine that the amount of earnings that the applicant 
would have received had she not been incapacitated was nil. Thus, by application of s 8(10) of the Act, the normal weekly earnings were reduced to nil. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 316">Ms Scott-MacKenzie referred me to a number of decisions, including: the Federal Court decisions of Bortolazzo v Comcare Australia 
 [1997] FCA 515 , (1997) 75 FCR 385 ; and Comcare v Burgess 
 [2007] FCA 1663 , (2007) 164 FCR 66 ; and the Tribunal decisions of Re Saldanha and Comcare [1995] AATA 580 , (1995) 38 ALD 451 ; Re Watterson and Comcare [2005] AATA 1198, (2005) 89 ALD 115 ; Re Kennedy and Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2007] AATA 19 , (2007) 93 ALD 700 ; and Re Lower and Comcare [2008] AATA 352 , (2008) 102 ALD 195. 
She said these cases stood for the proposition that s 8(10) of the SRC Act required the decision-maker to focus on what the applicant would be earning but for the injury. Thus in Bortolazzo, the injured employees had their NWE reduced to reflect reductions in overtime paid to their colleagues following a restructure. The Court held the reduction under s 8(10) was necessary to bring the injured workers' NWE into line with what they would have been earning but for their injuries if they had remained at work. Similarly, in Re Lower , the Tribunal found the applicant would have lost his entitlement to shift allowances if he had remained at work because of a changed worked environment and poor performance so it was proper to deduct an amount from NWE to reflect the change. </sentence>
