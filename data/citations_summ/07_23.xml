<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1699">122 The Commissioner rejects the suggestion that the applicants' evidence in their witness statements about their subjective purpose was uncontested. It was submitted that each applicant gave evidence (but was challenged) to the effect that his subjective purpose for entering into the scheme was to obtain a return and not to pay less tax. The Commissioner relies on the fact that a finding as to the relevant subjective purpose for the purposes of s 226L is not to be based solely on the evidence of the taxpayer: Starr [2007] FCA 23 ; 65 ATR 86 at [29] , [38] and [52]. The Commissioner says that in reality each applicant was cross-examined about entry into the Project and in particular why it was thought that such entry would obtain a return on investment.  124 However, I am inclined to accept the submission of the applicants that for the Tribunal not to refer to the subjective purpose at all and to the evidence and its findings on that issue, even though it may prove to be only one component making up the ultimate finding in relation to purpose, was an error. Doubtless, had the decision of Starr [2007] FCA 23 ; 65 ATR 86 gained greater notoriety prior to the publication of the reasons in these applications, (which could easily have been achieved by the applicants seeking leave to make additional submissions as a result of the decision) then this matter could have been drawn to the attention of the Tribunal.  125 The Commissioner complains that it is inappropriate for the applicants to attack the Tribunal's decision on this basis when at no time did it seek to emphasise to the Tribunal after the handing down of the decision in Starr the importance of reaching a finding in relation to the credibility of the applicants on the topic of their subjective purpose. While there may be some force in that observation, nevertheless, it appears to me that on the authorities, it is necessary on the issue of penalty, for the Tribunal to take into account the subjective purpose of the applicants and particularly to express its conclusion on whether or not it accepted the evidence given by the applicants on that topic. This, the Tribunal did not do. In my view, although the error of law which this omission constitutes is understandable in light of the failure to refer the Tribunal to the decision of Starr [2007] FCA 23 ; 65 ATR 86 , nevertheless it constitutes a reviewable error.  123 The Commissioner submits that the appropriate way to treat the reasons when the Tribunal has expressed no finding in relation to the evidence as to subjective purpose is that the Tribunal found the evidence of subjective purpose was of little or no assistance. That approach, it is submitted, would accord with the observation in Starr [2007] FCA 23 ; 65 ATR 86 that the subjective purpose conclusion should be reached not solely from the evidence of the taxpayer.  118 The applicants rely on the decision of Starr v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 23 ; (2007) 65 ATR 86. At the time of arguing the matter before the Tribunal the decision in Starr had not been delivered. By the time the Tribunal published its reasons in April 2007, however, the decision had been delivered.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] AATA 946">See Starr v Commissioner of Taxation; Hopkins v Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 65 ATR 86 ; [2007] FCA 23 at [47] and see on appeal Commissioner of Taxation v Starr (2007) 164 FCR 436 , [2007] FCAFC 204 at [9] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 510">22 The hearing of the Tribunal commenced a short time after French J delivered the decision in Starr v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 23. After delivery of this decision, his Honour's decision was unanimously upheld in the Full Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Starr [2007] FCAFC 204 ; (2007) 164 FCR 436.  In the event that the Tribunal is of the view that the expenditure claimed by the Applicants is not properly allowable under the general deduction provisions of section 51(1) of the 1936 Act and the consequential non application of Part IVA of the 1936 Act, the Applicant is not liable to pay any penalties pursuant to section 224(2) of the 1936 Act. 81. The clear effect of his Honour Justice French's judgment in Starr v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 23 and Hopkins v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 23 is that the Respondent must have regard to the Applicant's actual or subjective purpose in determining whether penalties under section 224(2) of the 1936 Act can be imposed. The Respondent cannot disregard the Applicants' actual purpose (as can be done under Part IVA of the 1936 Act). 82.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 199">The initial phrase in section 224(2), scheme within the meaning of Part IVA, refers to the meaning given to scheme in Part IVA, specifically by section 177A. See Starr v Commissioner of Taxation; Hopkins v Commissioner of Taxation 2007 ATC 4080 ; (2007) 65 ATR 86 ; [2007] FCA 23 at [47] . The Tribunal is of the opinion that the JV Project clearly falls within the meaning of scheme so defined. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 397">13 In my view, the Tribunal erred in its construction of the Act and in its reliance upon, and reference to, the case of Starr v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 23 ( Starr ) as being applicable in the circumstances of each of the appeals.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] AATA 1764">The position as regards penalties is also somewhat odd. Penalties were originally assessed at a much higher rate, but subsequently were reduced to five per cent, which constituted in my view, a quite extraordinarily generous concession. Some of the applicants objected against the penalty and some did not. Mr Fenwick was one who did not, according to the objection before the Tribunal, although he nevertheless contended that he did object to the penalty imposed. A recent judgment of French J in Starr v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 23 ; (2007) 65 ATR 86 indicates that at least so far as penalty is concerned the subjective intentions of the taxpayer are relevant. In respect of these applications, I have come to the conclusion that the intentions of the applicants, whether subjective or otherwise, related purely, and only, to the tax benefits to be derived. In my view, a penalty of five per cent was, in each case, and whether or not there was an objection, decidedly generous and there is no basis whatsoever for any further reduction. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] AATA 1206">Relief in the form of remission of part of the penalty is therefore justified to reflect the contribution of professional advisers to the applicant's liability and on whose advice he was entitled to rely. This conclusion is also consistent with Re Kowadlo and Kowadlo and Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 786 where Senior Member Pascoe said that the purpose was "... to penalise non-compliance with the requirements of the legislation. Loss of revenue is not the issue" (see paragraph 10). The main purpose of the transaction involved in this case was for the purpose of property development and to make a commercial return. The potential tax benefits were incidental to the transaction, although not insignificant from a financial point of view. They were not the sole or dominant purpose of the applicant's transaction and there was no deliberate avoidance of tax obligations. In making a determination of the applicant's grounds of review, the Tribunal should take account not only of objective factors, but also of the subjective evidence of the applicant ( Starr v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 23 per French J), who was accepted as an honest person, and who needed the advice and service of other parties who were professional persons. </sentence>
