<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 676">Section 149K provides for a limited review by the Inspector General of a decision of the trustee to file a notice of objection but in the case of an objection on a special ground [2] that review is confined to whether there is sufficient evidence to support the existence of at least one special ground and whether the bankrupt had a reasonable excuse for the conduct or failure that constituted the special ground. Absent those circumstances the Inspector General is not permitted to cancel the objection (s.149N). That procedure has not been followed in the present case. It is an alternative procedure and does not affect the operation of s.178 [3] . Thus the applicant moves under s.178.  Although the Court has a wide discretion, the Court is hesitant to make orders which have the effect of interfering in the day to day administration of a bankrupt's estate or in cases involving an exercise of business or commercial judgment. In any event, considerable weight is to be placed on the trustee's decision and the Court will not intervene under s.178 simply because the judge forms a different view to that of the trustee (see Frost v Sheahan [2008] FCA 1073).  In Frost v Sheahan [9] Besanko J identified a number of basic principles pertaining to operation of the objection provisions in the Bankruptcy Act : 1. The power to prevent a discharge from bankruptcy by operation of law by filing a notice of objection is "a great power": Van Reesema v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [1983] FCA 202 ; (1983) 69 FLR 424 at 430-431; [1983] FCA 202 ; 50 ALR 253 at 260; Prentice v Wood [2002] FCAFC 48 ; (2002) 119 FCR 296 at 300 [19] - [21]. 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 20">
 The appellant, Mr Frost, is a bankrupt. The respondent is the trustee of Mr Frost's bankrupt estate. Mr Frost applied to the Court to set aside the trustee's decision not to withdraw objections to Mr Frost's discharge from bankruptcy. The primary judge dismissed the application ( Frost v Sheahan (2008) 249 ALR 538 ; [2008] FCA 1073). In this appeal Mr Frost contends that the primary judge erred in dismissing his application and seeks an order that the trustee withdraw all objections to the discharge from bankruptcy. </sentence>
