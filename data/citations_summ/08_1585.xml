<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 394">As Moore J explained in Rojas v Esselte Australia Pty Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 1585 , the following matters, while not intended to be an exhaustive list of relevant matters, should be regarded in exercising the discretion to impose a pecuniary penalty: the circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place, including whether it was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act; whether the respondent has previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of the particular part of the Act in question; whether more than one contravention of the particular part of the Act is involved, and whether the contraventions are properly seen as distinct or arising out of the one course of conduct; the consequences of the conduct found to be in contravention of the particular part of the Act; the need, in the circumstances, for the protection of industrial freedom of association; and the need for deterrents --- both specific and general. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 276">Mr Joseph submits that the policy underlying the legislation is to protect freedom of association, including those persons who wish to be members of a union and avail themselves of the services provided by their union. This can only be properly done if unlawful actions (such as terminating a person's employment because they were a union member) can be reversed. Section 807(3)(b) states: (3) The orders that may be made under paragraph (1)(c) include: (b) any other orders that the Court considers necessary to stop the conduct or remedy its effects. 
In Rojas v Esselte Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1585 , the parties agreed that reinstatement was an order that could be made by the Court utilising the provisions in question. His Honour Moore J made such an order without further comment. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 333">In Rojas v Esselte Australia Pty Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 1585 ; [2008] FCA 1585 ; (2008) 177 IR 306 at [49] --- [50], Moore J held that, in the proceeding before him, it was not sufficient for the applicant to simply allege that he was a member and delegate of an industrial organisation. Rather, on the assumption that the applicant was able to prove the fact of membership or delegateship of an industrial organisation, the burden was cast on the respondent to prove that his membership or delegateship of an industrial organisation did not form part of the reason for the termination of his employment.  Having regard to the usual principles that apply to the determination of a penalty, as summarised by Moore J in Rojas v Esselte Australia Pty Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 1585 at [63] - [69], the Union submits that a pecuniary penalty in range of $15,000 to $20,000 for each contravention is appropriate. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FMCA 171">In order to make out its defence, an employer who is alleged to have contravened one of the provisions in which the word "because" is found must establish that the real reason for the adverse action did not include a prohibited reason. To do so, the real reason or reasons for taking the adverse action must be shown to be "dissociated" from the prohibited reason alleged to have actuated the adverse action: Barclay v Board of Bendigo Regional Institute of Technical &amp; Further Education at [32]. Although an allegation that a respondent's conduct was for a prohibited reason enables that allegation to stand as sufficient proof of the fact unless the respondent proves otherwise, it does not relieve an applicant from proving each of the ingredients of the contravention, namely that, in this case: the respondent dismissed the applicant or took other relevant adverse action; depending on the particular allegation, the applicant had one of the particular attributes described in ss.340(1)(a), 351(1) or 352; and also depending on the particular allegation, the respondent dismissed the applicant or took other relevant adverse action by reason of the applicant having the attribute, or for reasons that included the applicant having that attribute:

Dismissal --- ability to exercise workplace right
 In her claim to have been dismissed because she had exercised or proposed to exercise a workplace right, the applicant relies on the workplace right provided by s.341(1)(c), which relates to a person's ability to make a complaint or inquiry. In particular, she relies on s.341(1)(c)(ii) quoted above at [8].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] FMCA 66">In relation to the onus of proof, having reviewed judgments of the Federal Court in Bahonko v Sterjov [14] and Rojas v Esselte Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) , [15] and of this Court in Buckingham v KSN Engineering Pty Ltd &amp; Anor , [16] this Court observed in Hayward v Rohd Four Pty Ltd (2008) [17] that: 34. From the above review of the authorities I conclude that the determination of this proceeding requires the following: (a) The applicant proving the fact of employment and its termination; (b) The applicant proving such of the facts as he intends to rely upon to invoke one or more of the ... [relevant] provisions ... of the Act; (c) The respondents proving that such identified reasons were not the reason, or one of the reasons, for the termination of the applicant's employment; (d) In discharging that onus the respondents do not have to prove that the applicant's employment was terminated for a valid reason, as long as it was not terminated for a proscribed reason.

In circumstances in which legislation gives the Court a discretion to impose, or alternatively not to impose, a penalty, the Court must be satisfied that it is appropriate in all of the circumstances to impose a penalty before it makes such an order ( Alfred v Walter Construction Group Limited [2005] FCA 497 at [7] ). Conduct that is innocent or inadvertent may lead to the Court not imposing a penalty ( Rojas v Esselte Australia Pty Ltd (No.2) [2008] FCA 1585 at [64] ).

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] FCA 648">As a result: where there is an allegation of termination of employment by an employer for a proscribed reason, it is sufficient for it to be presumed that the conduct was engaged in for that reason unless the employer proves to the contrary: see, by way of example, Rojas v Esselte Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1585 ; (2008) 177 IR 306 at [46] --- [51]; Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal, Clerical and Services Union [2001] FCA 349 ; (2001) 112 FCR 232 at [7] ; Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers [1999] FCA 1108 ; (1999) 91 FCR 463 at [109] (dealing with the predecessor to s 298V of the WR Act); Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; (1999) 93 FCR 34 at 68. That presumption is rebuttable: Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; 93 FCR 34 at 68; however, notwithstanding that presumption, an applicant must prove the existence of objective facts which the applicant contends provide a basis for the respondent's contravening conduct: see Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1531 ; (1999) 140 IR 131 at [161] --- [162]. The presumption "simply ... alleviate[s] the evidentiary difficulty facing the applicant of providing proof of the intent or reason which motivated, or formed part of the motivation for , the respondent's conduct following the absence of the employee from work" (emphasis added); if an applicant proves those facts and alleges that the conduct was carried out for a prohibited reason, then the onus shifts to the respondent to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that it was not motivated by a proscribed reason: Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; [1999] FCA 899 ; 93 FCR 34 at 68. Why? Because, as Nicholson J stated, "[t]he reversal of the onus in respect of proof of the reasons for the conduct is a recognition that 'the circumstances by reason of which an employer may take action against an employee are, of necessity, peculiarly with the knowledge of the employer'"; and where the onus has shifted, an employer will usually need to adduce evidence of the real reason for the dismissal, consistent with the absence of a prohibited reason, to rebut the presumption: Rojas 177 IR 306 at [46] --- [51] and Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 ; (2006) 161 IR 9 at [29] . </sentence>
