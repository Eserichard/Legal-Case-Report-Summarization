<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1986">56 One difficulty was that the Authority sought an opportunity to itself make submissions. The Authority had previously been joined as the Second Respondent, in November 2007. But it had taken no real part in the present proceeding thereafter. Its participation was substantially confined to the related proceeding: Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2008] FCA 828. The Authority's renewed interest in the present proceeding occurred during the course of submissions in reply being advanced on behalf of Mr Rickus. The Authority, it was said, had an interest in being heard as to whether a person upon whom a notice had been served under s 255 of the 1993 Act thereafter came under a duty such as that now sought to be espoused by the Trustee. Notwithstanding the lateness of its expressed interest, the opportunity for the Authority to file written submissions confined to that issue was not opposed by Senior Counsel on behalf of the Trustee. Directions were made for the filing of written submissions and for submissions in reply by both Mr Rickus and the Trustee. 84 The other basis relied upon by the Trustee was that the documents provided by Mr Rickus were the property of the Trustee. As previously observed, it was not previously considered that an assertion as to property had been made out by the Trustee: Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2008] FCA 828 at [45] , [2008] FCA 828 ; 169 FCR 483 at 494. No reason has been advanced during the course of the present hearing to reach any contrary conclusion. 
  13 A related proceeding was also commenced by the Trustee. The Respondents to that proceeding were the Authority and Mr Rickus. In that proceeding, judicial review was sought of the Authority's decision to refuse to return the documents produced by Mr Rickus to the Trustee. That application was dismissed: Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2008] FCA 828 , 169 FCR 483. </sentence>
