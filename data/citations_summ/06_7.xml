<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 172">The applicant also seeks an order that 100% of the penalty be made payable to the union. The respondents are silent on this issue. In this regard, I note the provisions of s.841of the Act and note authorities to which the Court has been referred: Schanka v Employment National (Administration) Pty Limited [2001] FCA 1623 (15 November 2001). Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1847 (16 December 2005). Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 7 (16 January 2006). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1566">The range of penalties here is not great. I have been referred to a number of cases, which are of some assistance. In Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 7 , Marshall J imposed a penalty of $16 500 for a contravention which involved the termination of employment of an employee for reason of his position as a union delegate. However that penalty was imposed after a trial. In those circumstances the case offers an upper limit to the appropriate penalty in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FMCA 1281">Accordingly, she invited the Tribunal to consider her claims set out in her protection visa application (see SZEFM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) FCA 7).</sentence>
