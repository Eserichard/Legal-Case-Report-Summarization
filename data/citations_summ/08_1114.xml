<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1470">4 Both proceedings involved a dispute about the meaning of provisions in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth). In the principal proceedings the subject of the appeal the relevant provisions are ss 793(1)(j) and (k). In the directors and officers proceedings the subject of the appeal the relevant provision is s 793(1)(j). This Court granted the appellant leave to appeal against both decisions (in the principal proceedings see Dowling v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1114 ; in the directors and officers proceedings, where the leave to appeal application was heard later, the grant of leave was by consent on 26 August 2008). The appeals were expedited. </sentence>
