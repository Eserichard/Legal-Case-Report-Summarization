<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 45">1 In 2003, the appellant Ms Bienstein made separate requests for access to documents to each of the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth and the Minister for Justice and Customs (now the Minister for Home Affairs). Those requests became the subject of proceedings and a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the AAT"). Ms Bienstein appealed the AAT's decision to this Court. She also made a related application for an order of review pursuant to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("the ADJR Act"). Both applications were heard, determined and dismissed by the trial judge who also made an order that Ms Bienstein pay the respondents' costs: Bienstein v Attorney-General [2009] FCA 1501. This decision deals with Ms Beinstein's appeal from the judgment of the trial judge.</sentence>
