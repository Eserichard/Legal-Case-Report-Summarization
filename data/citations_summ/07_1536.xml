(3) Mr Mokbel's arguments based on what I refer to as the extradition ground are, in my view, misconceived insofar as unlawfulness is contended for; and rely on circumstances which are, in my view, very far from the circumstances which would require or justify a stay on the basis of reprehensible conduct by those in authority. (4) Mr Mokbel has previously unsuccessfully attacked his extradition before the Federal Court, both at first instance and on appeal, [6] and has sought a stay on very similar grounds to those contended for before me from Kaye J, [7] again without success. (5) An appeal at this stage will be disruptive not only to the trials in the proceedings in which the application has been made, but in relation to a number of related trials where there are co-accused, not all of whom are on bail. [8] There has already been considerable delay as a consequence of Mr Mokbel's application for a stay and the prospect of an interlocutory appeal is likely to result in further delay.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 691">This ground for Mr Zentai is substantially more challenging than some. The circumstances in which one sovereign nation would reach a conclusion to this effect with another treaty country will be rare indeed. In Mokbel v Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1536 ; (2007) 162 FCR 278 Gordon J said (at [59]-[60): 
 
 [59] The courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own territory. This principle of non-adjudication is consistent with the international rule of comity which refers to the respect or courtesy accorded by a country to the laws and institutions of another . This was made clear in Attorney-General (UK) v Heinemann Publishers Australia Pty Ltd [1988] HCA 25 ; (1988) 165 CLR 30 at 40-41: (emphasis added) 
 

 
 
 
 The rule is associated with a related principle of international law, which has long been recognized, namely that, in general, courts will not adjudicate upon the validity of acts and transactions of a foreign sovereign State within that sovereign's own territory. The procedures, as set out further in paragraph 198 below in the context of fair trial considerations, allow amongst other things for the independent judicial assessment and evaluation of evidence. Australian courts have repeatedly held that a court in a foreign country should not comment on or interfere with the domestic procedures in another State. As was said by Gordon J in Mokbel v Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1536 ; (2007) 162 FCR 278 at [58] - [59]: 
 
 
 
 '[The] courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own territory. This principle of non-adjudication is consistent with the international rule of comity which refers to the respect or courtesy accorded by a country to the laws and institutions of another'.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] VSC 433">16 In response, Dr G Griffith QC, who appeared with Mr C Young for the first defendant, submitted that in order to succeed on his application, the plaintiff must establish that the Greek state acted unlawfully in surrendering the plaintiff to Australian authorities for extradition, that the Australian authorities were a party to that unlawful conduct or connived in it, and that the Court should intervene because the seriousness of the misconduct of the Australian authorities outweighs the seriousness of the offences alleged against the plaintiff. Dr Griffith submitted that the plaintiff does not allege, and there is no evidence of, any unlawful conduct by either the Greek government or the Australian government in extraditing the plaintiff to Australia. The plaintiff has not asserted any unlawful conduct by the Greek government. Nor would he be entitled to do so, as the courts of this country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another country done within the latter's own territory. [6] It has not been submitted, or established, by the plaintiff that the requirements of the Treaty on Extradition between Australia and the Hellenic Republic had not been complied with. Further, in light of the Greek government's decision to surrender the plaintiff to Australian authorities, it was the obligation of Australian authorities to accept that surrender.  43 In response, the defendants made two principal submissions. First, they submitted that the plaintiff could only make out an abuse of process, if the plaintiff was able to establish unlawful conduct by the Australian government, or unlawful conduct by the Greek government, to which the Australian government was a party or at which the Australian government connived. In particular, counsel for both defendants relied on a passage in the judgment of McHugh JA (as his Honour then was) in Levinge v Director of Custodial Services [33] to that effect. In this case, no such unlawful conduct has been proven or alleged. Nor has it been alleged that the Australian government participated in, or connived at, any unlawful conduct by the Greek government. Indeed, as observed by counsel, this Court is not entitled to pass judgment on the lawfulness or otherwise of the conduct of the Greek government in surrendering the plaintiff to Australian authorities for extradition. [34] Secondly, in any event, it was submitted by the defendants that the conduct of the Australian government, alleged and relied upon by the plaintiff, is not of such an egregious character as to constitute an abuse of process. In particular, when balancing the conduct alleged by the plaintiff against the Australian government, against the important public interest in ensuring that persons charged with serious criminal offences be brought to justice in this country, it could not be concluded that the prosecution of the plaintiff on the charges for which he was lawfully extradited to Australia would constitute an abuse of process of the courts of this State. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCAFC 165">11 On 24 December 2007, a judge of this Court dismissed a proceeding (the Primary Proceeding) brought by the applicant (Mr Brock) under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) for review of a decision of the respondent (Minister) made on 12 May 2005 to give a notice under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act 1998 (Cth) (the Act) in relation to Mr Brock (Notice of Receipt of Extradition Request). The Primary Proceeding was Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 ; (2007) 243 ALR 315. Subsection 16(1) provides:
 Where the Attorney-General receives an extradition request from an extradition country in relation to a person, the Attorney-General may, in his or her discretion, by notice in writing in the statutory form expressed to be directed to any magistrate, state that the request has been received. The Attorney-General and the Minister share responsibilities in the Attorney-General's portfolio, including in relation to extradition. Although the Act refers to the Attorney-General, the Minister is also able to exercise the Attorney-General's power under the Act: see s 19A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1988 (Cth); and generally, Mokbel v Attorney-General (Cth) [2007] FCA 1536 ; (2007) 162 FCR 278 at [22] - [29]. We note that the respondent was previously named in the title Minister for Justice and Customs, but pursuant to order 1 of the orders made by the primary judge in the Primary Proceeding, the name of the respondent in the title was changed to Minister for Home Affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1684">129 The division of portfolio responsibilities between the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice and Customs had the effect of allocating responsibility for the Extradition Act to the latter Minister. Senator Johnston also had authority to exercise the functions and powers conferred on the Attorney-General in that Act under s 19A(1)(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act . This result is in the interest of efficient government administration: Attorney-General (Cth) v Foster [1999] FCA 81 ; (1999) 84 FCR 582 at 593 [37] , 595 [42] per von Doussa, O'Loughlin and Mansfield JJ; Mokbel v Attorney-General [2007] FCA 1536 at [34] ; see too at [42]-[43] per Gordon J; affirmed [2007] FCAFC 161 at [6] , per Heerey J with whom North and Jessup JJ agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCAFC 161">5 Her Honour dismissed the application: Mokbel v Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1536. Her Honour relied on the following grounds: 
 
 &#8226; the source of power to request extradition was the executive power of the Commonwealth; 
 &#8226; section 40 was a machinery provision which regulated the exercise of that power;
 &#8226; under ss 61 , 62 and 64 of the Constitution and the Administrative Arrangements Order of 21 September 2006 the Governor-General appointed the Honourable Philip Ruddock MP to hold the office of Attorney-General and to administer the Attorney-General's Department (instrument dated 26 October 2004) and appointed Senator Johnston to hold the office of Minister for Justice and Customs and to administer the same Department (instrument dated 9 March 2007). The legislation administered by that Department includes the Extradition Act ; 
 &#8226; section 19A of the Acts Interpretation Act1901 (Cth) provides that if a provision of an Act refers to a particular Minister then, unless the contrary intention appears, where for the time being two or more Ministers administer the provision, the reference is a reference to any one of those Ministers; and 
 &#8226; the appellant's argument was inconsistent with the legislative history of s 19A and the decisions in Attorney-General v Foster [1999] FCA 81 ; (1999) 84 FCR 582 and Re Patterson; ex parte Taylor [2001] HCA 51 ; (2001) 207 CLR 391. </sentence>
