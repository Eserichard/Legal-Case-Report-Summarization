<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 1254">17. The Court accepts the submissions by the first respondent in relation to these claims as follows: 
 
 
 24. There is no error in the Tribunal being aware of the previous Tribunals' reasons for decision; indeed, this would be prudent in order to avoid the previous Tribunals' errors: SZHSE v Minister [2006] FCA 1459 at [17] (RD Nicholson J); Collins v Minister [1981] FCA 147 ; (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 602-603 (Fox, Deane and Morling JJ). Consideration of inconsistencies between what an applicant tells the current Tribunal and what the applicant told a previous Tribunal (as set out in the first s.424A letter at CB 152-4) is permissible in the same way that consideration of evidence of any prior inconsistent statement is permissible.
