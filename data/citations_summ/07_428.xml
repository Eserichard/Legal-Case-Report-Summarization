<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1089">10 An appeal to this Court was heard and determined by Collier J, the relevant appeal being dismissed on 27 March 2007 (see [2007] FCA 428). An application for special leave to appeal from the decision of Collier J came before the High Court and was refused on 7 February 2008 (see [2008] HCA Trans 35). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 737">The Tribunal referred to the fact that a previous Tribunal member had affirmed the delegate's decision on 23 May 2005, and that the validity of that decision was upheld by this Court in SZGQN v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 1344. An appeal was dismissed in the Federal Court (see SZGQN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 428) , and an application for special leave was dismissed by the High Court on 7 February 2008 (see SZGQN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] HCATrans 35). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 358">For the respondent Minister Ms Wong of counsel submitted that the principal difficulty for the applicant is that there was no general duty upon the Tribunal to investigate or inform itself or make further inquiries as acknowledged by the applicant herself in the written submissions (see VCAK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [5] , also SZGQN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship ). [6] The Tribunal had already conducted investigations into two other birth certificates provided by the applicant and these were found to be false by the Indonesian authorities. Having regard to the alterations made to the face of the further birth certificate submitted for the applicant and the applicant's inability to name her purported son Mateos at hearing, the Tribunal was entitled to place little weight on the further documents provided, and in particular, the death certificate for the applicant's alleged twin sister. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 303">The next is that "[t] he respondent refused to grant our protection visa without any proper grounds and proper investigation ". However the reasons for decision reveal that, contrary to this contention, the Tribunal gave reasons for its decision. In particular it was based on the applicants' own evidence, especially their evidence at the hearing. It did not accept that they became Falun Gong practitioners in China. This is not a case in which there was an obligation on the Tribunal to conduct enquiries as appears to be contended. It is for an applicant to put his or her case to the Tribunal and for the Tribunal to determine whether it is satisfied that the criteria for the protection visa are met (see SZGQN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 428 at [28] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 4">It is well established that there is generally no obligation on the Tribunal to conduct its own investigation or to make some particular enquiry (see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 at [42] --- [43]; Re Ruddock; Ex parte S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437 at [58] ; WAGJ of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 277 at [25] ; Applicant S214 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 375 at [34] ; S1194/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1133 at [13] ; W389/01A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 432). There is no provision in Part 7 of the Migration Act which obliged the Tribunal to make enquiries or conduct its own investigation in light of s.422B of the Act (see SZGQN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 428 at [28] and cf s.424). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 1482">The Tribunal dealt with this issue in its analysis at CB 109.5 and found that "the applicant's response is a transparent attempt to reconcile the inconsistencies in his evidence" (CB 109.7). The applicant complains that the Tribunal's refusal to contact Mr William to find the truth is not understandable. Firstly, as Ms Wong submits, this is a matter to which s.422B of the Act applies and there is no obligation upon the Tribunal to exercise its discretionary investigatory powers pursuant to s.424 and s427 of the Act (see SZGQN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 428 at [28] ), but it is also not clear how contacting Mr William would have assisted the applicant in any event. Plainly a letter on the letterhead of the "Local Church in Sydney" signed, amongst others, by a "Mr William Poh, 'Responsible Brother'" stated that the applicant attended the Local Church in Sydney in April 2004. The Tribunal did not reject this letter but found that what was stated in the letter did not outweigh its concerns with the applicant's credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FMCA 1317">In all cases the Tribunal does not fail to comply with its obligations under the Act if it fails to make, or to consider making, an inquiry: SZEGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1514. Further, the introduction of s 357A of the Act has put the position beyond doubt. Section 357A provides that Pt 5 Div 5 of the Act is an exhaustive statement of the requirements of natural justice, and there is no provision in Part 5 which obliges the Tribunal to make enquiries or conduct its own investigation: see SZGQN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 428 at [28] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 710">17 It would appear that s 422B of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) applies to the appellant's application. Prior to the introduction of s 422B there was generally no obligation on the Tribunal to conduct its own investigation or to make some particular inquiry: see generally, WAGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 277 at [25] ; Applicant S214 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 375 ; (2006) 90 ALD 632 at 641; and S1194/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1133 at [13] . With the introduction of s 422B this position is made clear: see SZGQN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 428 at [28] .</sentence>
