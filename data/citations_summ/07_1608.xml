<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 90">15 However, for completeness, we should say that, even if the appellant had satisfied this Court that s 65A was an invalid exercise of power by the Commonwealth or that the proceedings were an abuse of process by the respondent, the appellant could not have availed himself of those contentions on this appeal. The orders upon which the finding of contempt and the sentence of imprisonment rest were orders made by a judge of a superior court and with which the appellant was bound to comply until the orders were set aside: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608 ; Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2006] FCAFC 118 ; (2006) 152 FCR 129 at 137-138; Re Macks; Ex parte Saint [2000] HCA 62 ; (2000) 204 CLR 158 at 177-178, 185-187, 235, 279.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 88"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 101">1 By order made herein dated 7 November 2007 I appointed Mr Colin Nicol as receiver to deal with certain funds which had been held in the names of the respondent, the Terra Nova Cache and the Principality of Camside. The circumstances in which the receiver came to be appointed are explained in my judgment in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608. Mr Nicol entered on his task promptly. He has discovered various funds which are additional to those which are identified in Schedule A of the order made on 7 November 2007. He has also identified a large number of persons who claim to have made deposits in the Terra Nova Cache. He has sought the co-operation and assistance of the respondent in identifying depositors and the whereabouts of moneys contributed by them. He has received very little assistance from the respondent in response to these requests. 13 Counsel for the receiver argued that these orders should be made because the respondent had, during the period of the receivership, failed to respond to requests made by the receiver that he provide relevant documents to the receiver. In particular the receiver relied on the failure of the respondent to comply with paragraph five of the orders made on 7 November 2007 which required the respondent to provide to the receiver "all bank statements, books of accounts, receipts, invoices, correspondence or other documents in his possession, custody, power or control relating to monies received from members of the public for deposit in the Terra Nova Cache. " The receiver's solicitor had written on numerous occasions to the respondent requesting that he comply with the Court's order. The respondent had not done so. He had, through his solicitors, made general claims that he could not be required to produce any documents because of the protection afforded him by the privilege against self incrimination. In one letter the respondent acknowledged that he had three documents (bank statements) which fell within the terms of the order. He also provided the receiver with a copy of documentary evidence tendered in the course of the trial of the principal proceeding in which the order appointing the receiver was made: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608. The respondent has failed to advise the receiver whether there are additional documents, which although not in his possession, are within his power or control. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 2098">1 On 26 October 2007, Tracey J delivered judgment in proceeding number VID 1607 of 2005. The judgment is published under the designation Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608. In the proceeding in which that judgment was given, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ("APRA") sought, among other things, relief by way of a permanent injunction against the respondent, Mr Siminton, pursuant to s 65A of the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) ("the Banking Act "). Section 65A provides that the Court may grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct, or requiring the person to do a particular act or thing, in such terms as the Court thinks appropriate, if there is a contravention or threatened contravention of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1714">1 On 26 October 2007 I delivered judgment in this proceeding: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608. I found that Mr Siminton was a person who had carried on and was proposing to carry on the business of banking in Australia and that such conduct constituted or would constitute a contravention of s 7 of the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) ("the Act"). I also found that Mr Siminton had engaged in conduct which contravened s 66 of the Act. I foreshadowed making injunctive orders to restrain Mr Siminton from engaging in further contraventions of the Act and orders appointing a receiver to identify the persons who had made deposits in the "bank" established by Mr Siminton, to get in the funds which were the subject of an order, made by Gray J on 10 January 2006, and to provide for an orderly and equitable distribution of those funds to depositors. I listed the matter for mention on 7 November 2007. On that day I made the foreshadowed orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 1612">9 The first objection was that s 65A of the Act was "unconstitutional" and that this precluded the laying of contempt charges. I rejected this contention for reasons which I gave when dealing with the principal proceeding: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton [2007] FCA 1608 at [7] to [11]. 12 The fourth objection was that the principal application was an abuse of process which should permanently be stayed or struck-out. This submission was also made in the principal proceeding. I rejected it then: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608 at [25] to [27]. I reject it now.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1609">The first was that, for a variety of reasons, provisions of the Act on which APRA relied in the principal proceeding were "unconstitutional". There was also an objection that the principal proceeding was an abuse of process and that it should permanently be stayed. I rejected these submissions for reasons which I gave when dealing with the principal proceeding: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608 at [7] to [27]. In any event, these arguments cannot avail Mr Siminton in contempt proceedings. As the Full Court pointed out in Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2006] FCAFC 118 ; (2006) 152 FCR 129 at 137-8:
 
 "An order made by a superior court of record stands and is bound to be observed even though it may ultimately be determined that the order should not have been made or was made without jurisdiction.</sentence>
