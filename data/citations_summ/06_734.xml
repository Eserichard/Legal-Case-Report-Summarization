<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] NSWSC 532">9 As is clear from paragraph 102 of my judgment, Mr Clelland SC, then appearing for the Accused, relied upon the decisions of Kiefel J in Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1577 ; [2002] 51 ATR 629 , the decision of Hill J in Walstern Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1428 ; [2003] 138 FCR 1 , the decision of Merkel J in Spotlight Stores Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 650 ; [2004] 55 ATR 745 , the decision of the Full Federal Court comprising Ryan, Sackville and Sundberg JJ in Pridecraft Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 339 ; [2004] FCAFC 339 ; [2004] 213 ALR 450 and the decision, at first instance, in Indooroopilly of Collier J at [2006] FCA 734. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] AATA 976">81. Whilst the respondent submitted formally that these cases were wrongly decided it was accepted that we were bound to follow them and, in consequence, allow the applicant's fringe benefits tax objections. It was submitted, somewhat faintly, that we should defer consideration of the application of the fringe benefits tax legislation pending the outcome of the Commissioner's appeals to the Full Federal Court from the decisions in Indooroopilly Children Services (Qld) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [17] and Cameron Brae Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [18] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] NSWSC 788">45 The principle of judicial comity is well recognised and is applied as between judges of the same or co-ordinate jurisdictions. The relevant authorities are summarised by Collier J in Indooroopilly Children's Services (Qld) Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (2006) FCA 734 at paragraphs 49, 52, a decision upon which the Accused relies for other purposes in the present applications. In Valentine v Eid (1992) 27 NSWLR 615 , Grove J held that the Local Court is not bound by a decision of the District Court in criminal proceedings, but that the principle of comity applies. His Honour said at 622:
 

 
 "I emphasise that I am not suggesting that a Local Court may not be considerably advantaged by reference to a relevant judgment of the District Court and I would expect that, except on rare occasions, such judgment would be compellingly persuasive and I hold no more than that a binding precedent has not been created. I refer to Lord Goddard's statement of principle in Police Authority for Huddersfield v Watson (1947) KB 842 that a judge of first instance of the High Court will follow a decision of another judge of first instance, unless he is convinced that that judgment is wrong, as a matter of judicial comity--- a principle now extended to apply to divisional courts in Britain: R v Greater Manchester Coroner; Ex Parte Tal [1985] QB 67 at 81. As comity is required between courts of equal rank, co-ordinate decision must also exist between the Local Court and District Court and a magistrate should not depart from following any decision of the District Court unless after earnest consideration and for good reason he or she became convinced that the decision was wrong. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 918">72 Because the contribution provided no entitlement in the nature of a superannuation benefit to either David or Andrew Hazlett, but only an expectancy of a favourable exercise of discretion by the Trustee of the IS &amp; PL Fund, it cannot be characterized as having been made in respect of the employment of either of them. This feature assimilates the present case to Indooroopilly Children Services (Qld) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 734 and provides a further point of distinction from Caelli (supra). The contribution was made, as I have found, to establish a flexible mechanism for distributing, between David and Andrew Hazlett, surplus income derived by Cameron Brae in the tax year ended 30 July 1998. The fact that it was expected, or hoped, that an entitlement in Cameron Brae to a deduction under s 82AAE of the Act or s 8-1(1) of the 1997 Act would render it tax effective is not to the point. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] AATA 634">
 11. It is immediately apparent that each of these allegations concerns the making of the amended FBT assessments. And it may also be observed that the Commissioner holds the view that Essenbourne was wrongly decided. That is not a view apparently shared by other judges of the Federal Court [3] and it is not a view that could prevail in this Tribunal which is, of course, bound by the decision.</sentence>
