<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1044">Section 24(1)(c) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act is confined in its terms to a veteran who is " prevented from continuing to undertake remunerative work ". The prospect at least exists of a veteran who is not currently undertaking " remunerative work " but who wishes to do so but is unable to obtain " remunerative work ". It is to this prospect that s 24(2) is directed. Section 24(1)(c) has at least two elements or " limbs ", namely: the war-caused incapacity preventing a veteran from continuing to undertake remunerative work by reason of the incapacity " alone "; and the veteran, by reason of that incapacity, " suffering a loss of salary or wages, or of earnings on his or her own account ". 
 Section 24(2) is directed to both of these limbs of s 24(1)(c). In contemplation of a veteran who is not currently undertaking remunerative work, such that it could possibly be said that he is not thereby " prevented from continuing to undertake remunerative work " ( Giesen v Repatriation Commission [2005] FCA 846 at [24] , [2005] FCA 846 ; 87 ALD 347 at 354 per Gray J; Baljas v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 171 at [20] per Gray J), s 24(2)(b) sets forth those circumstances in which such a veteran " shall be treated as having been prevented by reason of that incapacity from continuing to undertake remunerative work ". Section 24(2)(a) is directed to the other limb of s 24(1)(c) , namely the prospect of a veteran " suffering a loss of salary or wages, or of earnings on his or her own account ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 422">Counsel for the applicant argued that the Tribunal ought to have applied what he called the "ameliorating" provisions of s 23(3)(b) of the VE Act. That paragraph, in its terms, applies in the case of a person "who has not been engaged in remunerative work". I take the view that the paragraph has no application to a person who has been engaged in remunerative work after completing war service, but only to someone who has not been able to work at all. Compare the reasoning in Giesen v Repatriation Commission [2005] FCA 846 (2005) 87 ALD 347 at [19] - [26] and Baljas v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 171 at [20], in relation to the equivalent provision in s 24(2)(b) of the VE Act. Because the Repatriation Commission has been prepared to accept that the provisions are "ameliorating" in the case of someone who has been engaged in remunerative work, I have been prepared to take into account the provisions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 332">Counsel also referred to a further formulation applied by Gray J in Baljas v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 171 at [13] , namely whether the non-accepted condition(s) "play a part" in preventing the veteran from continuing to undertake remunerative work that he was previously undertaking. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 326">There are many cases where the existence of a non war-caused disability or illness which affects employability of a veteran disqualifies that person from receipt of special rate despite undoubted war-caused disabilities. As Gray J of the Federal Court confirmed in the case of Baljas v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 171 (' Baljas '), if a veteran is incapacitated or prevented from engaging in remunerative work for some reason other than the war-caused incapacity, the "alone" test will not be satisfied. </sentence>
