Amnesty International Report 2008 - Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories AZAAB -v- Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 248 (27 March 2009) The applicant's agent also submitted the signed original of the statutory declaration (declared by the applicant [in] May 2009 the draft of which was submitted to the Tribunal [in] June 2009) to the Tribunal. SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMS 
 The applicant has given a variety of reasons as to why she does not wish to return to Israel: (visa application form) this situation (like terrorists) bombing busses and restaurants in the middle of the day the people in Israel just got used to this situation so they don't care anymore [for] one another. So I just can't live like that, I can't go back home to my country and just live in fear all the time, and watch my neighbours, friends or even my family die.</sentence>
