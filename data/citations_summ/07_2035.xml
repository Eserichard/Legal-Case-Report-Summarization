<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 29">To obtain an order for substituted service on a respondent who is outside of the jurisdiction, overseas, an applicant must have made an application to serve them overseas, have attempted to have done so, and arguably been unsuccessful before an order for substituted service outside of the jurisdiction can be made. The Federal Court has previously stated that where respondents are out of Australia it is not appropriate to consider an order under O 7, r 9 of the FC Rules for substituted service unless some leave is at least obtained to serve the proceedings outside the jurisdiction pursuant to O 8 of the FC Rules . [57] This has been put as follows: "...so long as leave can be obtained to serve a respondent out of the jurisdiction, once such leave has been obtained, the Court's discretion to order service pursuant to such leave by substituted service is enlivened. " [58] Ms Carter revealed, during the course of the hearing, that TimeConti Sheffield had provided her with an address for Mr Salhah, pursuant to Order 1 of the Court's Orders of 1 July 2010. That address is a PO Box address in Amman, Jordan.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1218">It is now accepted that in certain circumstances, an order for substituted service under O 7 r 9 can be made in relation to a respondent that is outside of Australia: e.g. The Swan Brewery Co Ltd v Atlee [1998] FCA 277 ; Mercator Property Consultants Pty Ltd v Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd and Ors [1999] FCA 1572 ; (1999) 94 FCR 384 ; Unilever Australia Ltd v PB Foods Ltd [2000] FCA 798 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Kokos International Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2035 and Commissioner of Taxation v Ma (1999) 92 FCR 569. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 5">4 The ACCC commenced these proceedings on 1 November 2006 alleging contraventions by various parties of s 45 of the Act and the Code. The alleged contraventions involved price fixing in the provision of educational consultancy services to overseas students of Korean origin. The proceedings were commenced against Kokos, Chad Kim, IAE, Young Gil Pae, Sang-Hong Jung and Rebekah Cabalt. Study Overseas Now Pty Ltd (Study Overseas Now) was joined as a respondent to the proceedings subsequently. On 17 August 2007 the ACCC was given leave to serve on Mr Seow Bing Yeo, a director of that company, a notice of motion seeking his joinder, such service to be effected out of the jurisdiction in Japan through a diplomatic channel. For the reasons set out in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Kokos International Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2035 , that latter requirement was dispensed with and an order for substituted service made. </sentence>
