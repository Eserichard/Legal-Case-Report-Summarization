<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 97">The first obstacle lies in the failure of the respondents to file an Application seeking such order. Order 21 rule 3 of the Rules provides: 
Application A person seeking an order under rule 1 or rule 2 shall proceed by application. No such Application was made in the proceedings. Rather, the order was sought by the respondents by means of a Notice of Motion. As explained by Logan J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd (ACN 107 746 798) and Others [2008] FCA 1305 ; (2009) 250 ALR 82 at [48] - [50], the correct procedure to seek an order under O 21 r 1 and 2 is to apply in a separate proceedings by Application. Therefore, order 2 was not made pursuant to the Rules.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 426">At the outset it should be recognised that s 31A has been said to be a provision which " lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment ": Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [5] per Gilmour J. A " reasonable prospect of success " for the purposes of the section is one which is real and not fanciful or merely arguable: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [59] [2007] FCA 511 ; , 160 FCR 298 at 312 per Lindgren J; Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1305 at [41] , [2008] FCA 1305 ; 250 ALR 82 at 92. And, unlike an application pursuant to O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) that a matter be struck out, where it is the adequacy of the pleadings which is in issue, an action pursuant to s 31A " not only permits, but requires, a consideration of matters outside the pleadings ": Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd (in liq) [2008] FCA 1920 at [3] to [8] [2008] FCA 1920 ; , 252 ALR 41 at 43 to 45 per Finkelstein J. </sentence>
