<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 932">Although the Franchise Agreement has a specific law provision providing that it is governed by the laws of Queensland and that the parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Queensland courts, in this regard (and also in relation to the Queensland FT Act ) the Court adopts, with respect, what was said by the Federal Court in PEP Community Services Inc. t/as PEP Community Services v Jobs Futures Ltd [85] where the Federal Court said that: 9. It is to be noted that cl 35 is not an exclusive jurisdiction clause but I accept that it does disclose an intention on the part of the contracting parties to the litigation to prefer any dispute arising under the contract to be conducted in courts within the specified State: Australian Co-operative Foods Ltd &amp; Anor v National Foods Milk Ltd [1998] FCA 376 and Aquila Resources Limited v Pasminco Limited [2004] FCA 39 at [36] - [41]. 10. However, I also accept the applicant's submission that such a clause in a change of venue application does not carry weight where federal legislation is involved: Plantagenet Wines Pty Ltd v Lion Nathan Wine Group Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 247 at [61] per Siopis J. It is true also that little weight is attached to such a clause where State legislation is involved providing that such legislation is reasonably uniform in nature: Westpac Banking Corporation v O'Brien [1997] ACTSC 107 ; Rothwells Ltd (in liq) v Connell [1995] QSC 30. In this regard, it may be that the Court is required to construe the New South Wales Restraints of Trade Act 1976 (NSW) but no particular difficulty in doing so was advanced in argument... [86] Conclusion --- transfer to Brisbane Registry
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 227">The reliance by ANZ on a Victorian law provision in the Securities Lending and Borrowing Agreement (SLBA) as a basis for the proceeding being transferred to the Victoria District Registry, taken alone is not a significant factor. There is no particular reason why a Court sitting in Perth could not determine the effect of Victorian law in relation to the dispute. The clause is not an exclusive jurisdiction clause but its content did disclose an intention to prefer any dispute arising under the contract to be conducted in a court within the specified State: Australian Co-operative Foods Ltd &amp; Anor v National Foods Milk Ltd [1998] FCA 376 and Aquila Resources Limited [2004] FCA 39 at [36] - [41]. Notwithstanding this, however, such a clause in a change of venue application does not carry significant weight where federal legislation is involved: Plantagenet Wines Pty Limited v Lion Nathan Wine Group Australia Limited [2006] FCA 247 at [61]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1264">The respondent submits that this clause together with the convenience of witnesses tips the balance in favour of the hearing proceeding in the New South Wales Registry of this Court. 9 It is to be noted that cl 35 is not an exclusive jurisdiction clause but I accept that it does disclose an intention on the part of the contracting parties to the litigation to prefer any dispute arising under the contract to be conducted in courts within the specified State: Australian Co-operative Foods Ltd &amp; Anor v National Foods Milk Ltd [1998] FCA 376 and Aquila Resources Limited v Pasminco Limited [2004] FCA 39 at [36] - [41]. 10 However, I also accept the applicant's submission that such a clause in a change of venue application does not carry weight where federal legislation is involved: Plantagenet Wines Pty Ltd v Lion Nathan Wine Group Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 247 at [61] per Siopis J.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1265">The respondent submits that this clause together with the convenience of witnesses tips the balance in favour of the hearing proceeding in the New South Wales Registry of this Court. 9 It is to be noted that cl 35 is not an exclusive jurisdiction clause but I accept that it does disclose an intention on the part of the contracting parties to the litigation to prefer any dispute arising under the contract to be conducted in courts within the specified State: Australian Co-operative Foods Ltd &amp; Anor v National Foods Milk Ltd [1998] FCA 376 and Aquila Resources Limited v Pasminco Limited [2004] FCA 39 at [36] - [41]. 10 However, I also accept the applicant's submission that such a clause in a change of venue application does not carry weight where federal legislation is involved: Plantagenet Wines Pty Ltd v Lion Nathan Wine Group Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 247 at [61] per Siopis J.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1526">33 Although references occur in the Authorities to the 'inherent jurisdiction' of the Court ( McDermott v Richmond Sales (in liq) [2006] FCA 248 , per Kenny J; Plantagenet Wines v Lyon Nathan Wine Group Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 247 , per Sciopis J) the term is an inaccurate description of the 'incidental and necessary power' exercised by a statutory court ( DJL v Central Authority [2000] HCA 17 ; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at 241[25], per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron J, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) as the term 'inherent jurisdiction' is a reference to a jurisdiction subsisting 'without the aid of any authorising provisions' ( R v Forbes ; ex parte Bevan per Menzies J, at p 7). The distinction between a jurisdiction or power derived by implication from statutory provisions and a jurisdiction drawn from the 'well of undefined powers available to the common law courts at Westminster'( Grassby v The Queen [1989] HCA 45 ; (1989) 168 CLR 1 at 16) is 'fundamental' ( DJL v Central Authority [26]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 721">24 The respondents contend that there is limited scope of the claims that parties have agreed to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Western Australia and that therefore the Court should not attach much weight to the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause: cf Plantagenet Wines Pty Limited v Lion Nathan Wine Group Australia Limited [2006] FCA 247. They contend that the three express particular breaches pleaded in [10] and [11] of the amended statement of claim relate to the actions of Mr MacDonald. However, they say all other respondents are parties to each breach so that the scope of the claim is well outside the scope of the non-exclusive jurisdiction claim. Here, however, it cannot be said that the breach of the confidentiality requirement constitutes a limited part of the claims that the parties have agreed to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction. As has been explained in delineating the nature of the proceeding, it goes to the heart of the allegations under s 182 of the Corporations Act and the alleged breach of fiduciary duties: RP Meagher, JD Heydon, MJ Leeming, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity: Doctrines and Remedies, 4 th edn, Butterworths Australia 2002, 206, at [5-255]. The liability of Mr MacDonald is at the foundation of the liability of the other respondents. Therefore I consider that weight is to be accorded here to the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause.
