<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1364">295 While Mr Perry's submission that the expert opinion of Mr Frick did not comply with the relevant Practice Direction was technically correct, in the circumstances before me I make the following observations:
 
 
 a. It is clear from Mr Frick's affidavit, p 1 of his expert report (MBF-02) and the annexure MBF-03 (the Index to Documents (Crop Expert) indexing the material in the Brief to Crop Expert) that, in preparing his expert report, Mr Frick reviewed data in the Brief to Crop Expert volumes. b. Mr Frick's affidavit with the annexures including the expert report had been available to the applicants since 2006.
 c. Mr Bell QC informed the Court that the data in the Brief to Crop Expert was already in evidence before the Court at the time Mr Frick was sworn as a witness. I accept this information, and in any event note from reviewing the Brief to Crop Expert that the following material, of which copies were included in the Brief to Crop Expert, was already in evidence by the time that Mr Frick was called as a witness: exhibits A32, A5, R30, A16, A12, A13, A17, A19, A21, A37, A39, A43, A45, A52, A30, A58, A64 and A66. d. Although the two volumes of material composing the Brief to Crop Expert were not physically annexed to Mr Frick's expert report as provided by cl 2.7, it is well established that compliance with a practice note is not a criterion of admissibility of evidence: Centurion Roller Shutters Pty Ltd v Automatic Technology (Australia) Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1118 at [4] , Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 364 at [13] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] ATMO 6">Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 364 Affidavit evidence of Ms Shelton, which included a chocolate sensory study held to be admissible evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 850">25 The Shelton survey is dealt with at [69]-[79] of the trial judgment. My ruling on its admissibility is Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 364. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 446">69 Cadbury tendered (over the objection of Darrell Lea: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 364) a "Chocolate Sensory Study" consumer research report commissioned by it in August 2005 and conducted in October 2005 by Ms Caroline Shelton of National Field Services. The research methodology was provided by a firm called QBrand Consulting after consultation with Professor Roger Layton, Emeritus Professor of Marketing at the University of New South Wales. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 386">32 In any event, I would if necessary exercise the discretion under s 136 to limit the use of the documents to evidence of the fact that they were relied on by Cadbury. The documents in question can be contrasted with the evidence of another Cadbury witness, Ms Caroline Shelton, who conducted a survey of persons' reactions to various colours associated with chocolate. Her evidence was admitted over Darrrell Lea's objection: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 364. Ms Shelton was cross-examined, as was Professor Layton who had designed the methodology. The strengths and weaknesses of the survey were explored in evidence and can form the basis of rational submissions by the parties. By contrast, with the documents in question there is no witness equivalent to Ms Shelton or Professor Layton. They are of much less probative value, the absence of the authors is prejudicial to Darrell Lea and their admission for all purposes would add length and confusion to the trial; see Quick v Stoland Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 1200 ; (1998) 87 FCR 371 at 378, 382.
