 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Factual and procedural background 
 The applicant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who first arrived in Australia on 28 January 1999 as the holder of a student visa valid until 17 January 2001.  A hearing took place before a single judge of the Federal Court on 19 November 2009. The Federal Court indicated that although the matter was strictly not competent, it proposed to treat the substantive application as an application for leave to appeal. After hearing argument on the substantive application (treated as an application for leave to appeal) the Federal Court made orders that: 1. The application for an injunction to restrain the first respondent from removing the applicant from Australia be dismissed. 2. The application for leave to appeal from the refusal by Federal Magistrate Lucev to grant an injunction to restrain the first respondent from removing the applicant from Australia be dismissed. 3. The applicant is to pay the costs of the first respondent, to be taxed if not agreed. [8] </sentence>
