<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 361">When reference is made in s 33C(1)(c) to a " substantial common issue of law or fact ", the term " substantial " does not indicate that which is " large " or " of special significance " or would " have a major impact on the ... litigation " but, rather, is directed to issues which are " real or of substance ": Wong v Silkfield Pty Ltd , supra, at [28] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Callinan JJ. See also: Wotton v Queensland [2009] FCA 758 at [35] [2009] FCA 758 ; , 109 ALD 534 at 543 to 544. Even though there may be factual variations in claims advanced, it does not follow that s 33C(1)(c) is not satisfied: Green v Barzen Pty Ltd (formerly Dukes Financial Services Pty Ltd) [2008] FCA 920 at [13] . Finkelstein J there further observed that it " will be enough if there is at least a common nucleus of operative facts or legal issues. It will also suffice if what is alleged in substance amounts to a common course of conduct directed toward a particular group ...". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWCA 28">52 The significance of the reference to "claims" in the equivalent Commonwealth section, was emphasised by the Federal Court in Bright v Femcare Ltd [2002] FCAFC 243 ; (2002) 195 ALR 574 at [126] , where Kiefel J said:
 

 
 
 "[126] The focus of s 33C(1) , particularly paras (b) and (c), is upon the applicant's claims. It follows, in my view, that a determination as to whether the requirements of s 33C(1) have been met is to be made by reference to the pleading or other document in which the claims of the applicant and the group members are made. Section 33H(1) is intended to facilitate that assessment. Whether those issues will remain at the close of pleadings, and whether the evidence which will be led in each case might differ in some respects, are not matters which are relevant to a determination as to whether there is a common question and whether s 33C(1) is satisfied. "
