<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 94">The trial judge described the capitalisation rate as the "rate of return from a business that a purchaser seeks to achieve from the capital outlaid on the purchase of a business": Hermitage Motel Pty Ltd v P.E. Kafka Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 442 at [15] . As the trial judge recorded (at [16]), the capitalisation rate of the purchase price in fact paid by the purchaser on the basis of represented figures was known --- it was 15%. Mr Roberts adopted the same capitalisation rate --- 15%.  Next, the trial judge accepted that the purchaser's loss was to be calculated by deducting the true value of the Inn from the purchase price paid ($2,050,000). It was common ground that the true value of the Inn was to be assessed by capitalisation of the annual net return of the Inn and that the formula to be applied ( Hermitage Motel Pty Ltd v P.E. Kafka Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 442 at [7] ) was: 
 
 
 100 [rparenmid] capitalisation rate &#215; net return = value
 
 
 
  Mr Drewitt Smith adopted a capitalisation rate of 12.75% on the basis that the most directly comparable sales supported a capitalisation rate of between 12.25% and 12.5% but then selected a higher rate to reflect the fact that the Inn was then underperforming and the time required by an alternative operator to improve occupancy and overall profitability: see Hermitage Motel Pty Ltd v P.E. Kafka Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 442 at [18] .  The trial judge selected a capitalisation rate of 12.5% on the basis that if the actual results had been known by an informed purchaser, that purchaser would have recognised the possibility of correcting the downturn by better management and would therefore have been prepared to accept a lower capitalisation rate. As the trial judge noted ( Hermitage Motel Pty Ltd v P.E. Kafka Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 442 at [20]), adopting a lower capitalisation rate would result in an informed purchaser being willing to pay more for the Inn.  Mr Drewitt Smith had the actual trading figures for the years ended 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003. He was not provided with, and therefore did not rely upon, the actual trading figures for the period from 1 July 2004 until completion. His approach was to reconstruct the trading figures for the period from 1 July 2004 until completion by taking the actual trading figures for the years ended 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003 and adjusting those results upwards by 8.5%. He arrived at an estimated annual net profit before tax of $261,841: see Hermitage Motel Pty Ltd v P.E. Kafka Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 442 at [9] . Mr Drewitt Smith sought to justify his approach on the basis that a fire had occurred in the restaurant of the Inn on 26 May 2003. As a result of the fire, Mr Drewitt Smith assumed, the restaurant had been closed until 28 October 2003 which had seriously affected patronage and revenue. </sentence>
