<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 421">The primary judge was acutely conscious of the facts referred to by Mr Roe and repeated at paras 2(a)-(l) in the draft notice of appeal, and had regard to them. The primary judge also acknowledged, and dealt with, what Mr Roe said, was the special factor in the case which distinguished it from the case of "Pooncarie" Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v NSW Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation [2006] FCA 25 , namely, the potential conflict of interest in the applicant movers arising from their position as persons comprising the applicant in the Jabbir Jabbir claim. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 102">Where there is no accepted law or custom within a claim group relevant to authorisation, for example, due to conflicting practices within the group, then s 251B(b) would apply to the issue of authorisation: Combined Gunggandji Claim v Queensland [2005] FCA 575 and affirmed on appeal Noble v Murgha [2005] FCAFC 211. This also applies where some parts of a claim group assert customary decision-making processes, but that is not the law or custom of the whole group: Butchulla People v Queensland [2006] FCA 1063 ; (2006) 154 FCR 233 at [30] . In such circumstances, the adoption of a majority vote for making decisions has been accepted in numerous cases: Daniel at [36]; Holborow v Western Australia [2002] FCA 1428 ; Pooncarie Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v NSW Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation [2006] FCA 25 ; and Njamal People v Western Australia at [32].  The applicants on the motion do not seek to downplay the fact that the motion reflects a contest between competing groups within the claim group for the native title application. Such divisions are not uncommon in such applications. 'Pooncarie' Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v NSW Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation [2006] FCA 25 was such as case. There Stone J made orders pursuant to s 66B(2) NTA. This was in the face of a deeply held disagreement within the claim group where some believed that the area subject to the claim should be split between two claims, those of the people said to be 'pure' Barkandji and those of the other members of the claim group. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1204">Bennett J applied the same reasoning in SZFCX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 394 to ground a grant of leave. Factors found there to support the grant of leave were the complexity of the case, genuine difficulties experienced by the appellant in representing himself and the ability of the lay advocate to present the case better and more efficiently. Stone J in ' Pooncarie' Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v NSW Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation [2006] FCA 25 concluded that the applicant for leave there had neither the discipline nor understanding to assist the persons he would represent or the Court so that the grant of leave should be refused. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 512">15 The State also cites a body of law which recognises that the role of the applicant is a representative one and it submits that it is not competent for only some of those persons comprising the applicant to obtain separate legal representation and act in other than by unanimous agreement: see 'Pooncarie' Barkandji (Paakantye People) v New South Wales Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation [2006] FCA 25 at [10] and Sampi v Western Australia (No 2) [2005] FCA 1567 at [24] - [27]. In these circumstances, in my view, there is a significant doubt whether Mr Black's firm has been duly authorised to act. I think the better view is that there is no such authority on the face of the present documents and the evidence before me.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 192">78 In ' Pooncarie' Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v New South Wales Minister for Land and Water Conservation [2006] FCA 25 , Stone J at par 34 held that an 'applicant' can be 'replaced' by the withdrawal of one of the persons constituting the applicant albeit without replacing him or her.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 1638">Bennett J applied the same reasoning in SZFCX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 394 to ground a grant of leave. Factors found there to support the grant of leave were the complexity of the case, genuine difficulties experienced by the appellant in representing himself and the ability of the lay advocate to present the case better and more efficiently.
