<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 16">2 On 24 February 2006, the applicant companies (which I will describe collectively as "the Metcash companies") commenced proceedings against Mr Bunn. Interlocutory relief was sought to restrain publications by Mr Bunn relating to companies and their businesses which they claimed were objectionable. At a contested interlocutory hearing on 9 March 2006 at which Mr Bunn appeared without legal representation, Lander J of this Court was satisfied that there were serious questions to be tried in relation to alleged breaches of the companies' trademarks, inducements to third parties to breach their contracts with the Metcash companies and contraventions of s 52 and s 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth): Metcash Trading Limited v Bunn [2006] FCA 322. Being satisfied that the balance of convenience favoured the applicants, his Honour made interlocutory orders which included the following:</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1376">It is well established that the Refugee Review Tribunal cannot accept a second application for review of the same delegate's decision that has been confirmed already by the Refugee Review Tribunal ( SZASP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 (" SZASP "); SZAQW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1332 ; SZIHQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 496 ; S ZIIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 322 ; SZCKB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 804 ; SZBCE v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1897). I also refer to the authority of SZBWJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1175 , where Moore J, in confirming the principles in Jayasinghe , stated that the Refugee Review Tribunal did not possess the power to reopen or reconsider a decision that it had previously made. </sentence>
