 The fundamental thing to understand about the strike-out rule, which the language of O 11 r 16 itself makes clear, is that the rule is concerned only with the adequacy of the pleading (or to be more precise, the allegations and the causes of action asserted therein) as a matter of law. The rule does not permit or allow consideration of facts or evidence outside the pleadings: Dey v Victorian Railways Cmrs [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91 and 109 ... see also General Steel Industries Inc v Cmr for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129 ... Indeed, as counsel for ANZ, Mr Archibald QC, correctly noted in his submissions, the court must, for purposes of deciding the strike-out motion and deciding whether a pleading discloses a reasonable cause of action, assume the truth of the allegations in the statement of claim and draw all inferences in favour of the non-moving party because the question is whether those allegations, even if proved, cannot succeed as a matter of law: General Steel at CLR 129.</sentence>

 HIS HONOUR:
 
 Application 
 
 1 This is an application by the defendant, Saxo Bank A/S ("Saxo"), to strike out paragraphs 15 and 25 of the statement of claim filed by the plaintiff, Taverners J Pty Ltd ("Taverners"), dated 29 October 2010. It was common ground that paragraphs 15 and 25 of the statement of claim are the critical elements of the claim by Taverners against Saxo on the basis of its alleged "knowing receipt" of trust property supplied or transferred in breach of trust or fiduciary duties. It is a claim under the first limb of Barnes v Addy. [1]  22 Taverners submitted that paragraphs 15 and 25 of the statement of claim do comply with the relevant statutory provisions, rules and principles applicable to pleadings, particularly r 23.02 of the Rules. In so doing, it also emphasised that an application to strike out pleadings is concerned with the sufficiency of the pleadings, rather than the underlying prospects of success, and is assessed on the basis that the facts pleaded will be established at trial and that all the necessary inferences will be made in the pleading party's favour. [29] More particularly, it was submitted that Clarke v Great Southern Finance Pty Ltd [30] was concerned with an allegation of knowing involvement in a statutory contravention, a claim which the authorities made clear that the standard is actual knowledge. [31] It was said that a claim in "knowing receipt" is very different as the standard of knowledge is much lower and, relevantly, constructive knowledge suffices. [32]  
 
 
 10 More particularly, in relation to allegations of knowledge for the purpose of a "knowing receipt" claim, reference was made by Saxo to the following statement of Finkelstein J in Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd (in liq) (recs and mgrs appointed): [11] 
 
 
 "15. For a knowing receipt claim under Barnes , there are three elements: (1) receipt by the defendant of (2) trust property with (3) knowledge of the facts that (a) the property was trust property and (b) receipt was pursuant to a breach of fiduciary duty or misapplication of the property. " [references omitted] 
 

and
 
 
 "27. ... Precisely what constitutes knowledge for purposes of a Barnes knowing receipt claim has not been explicitly settled by the High Court, but I consider that the cases establish that it is sufficient to plead and prove knowledge of facts that would put an honest and reasonable person on notice (but not merely inquiry) of a real and not remote risk that the transfer was in breach of trust or fiduciary duty or involved the misapplication of trust property. " [12] [references omitted].

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1462">The question raised by the motion is purely one of statutory construction. As no evidence has been adduced on either side there is no occasion at this stage, to make findings of fact; cp Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd [2008] FCA 1920. The following summary is sufficient for an understanding of how the question now falling for determination has arisen. BACKGROUND
  Justice Rares in Boston 236 ALR at [45] was of the view that, unless there are no real issues of fact --- such that "only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable" --- summary judgment (or dismissal) ought not be given pursuant to s 31A. The Full Court has recently considered the summary judgment standard in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 (Finkelstein , Rares and Gordon JJ) ( Jefferson Ford ). Although different views were taken as to the precise operation of s 31A, the following principles appear to have been endorsed:
 In applying s 31A, the court does not conduct fact finding but must assess the strength of the allegations made by reference to the pleadings, affidavits and any other evidence adduced, in order to determine whether the claim is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial: see Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [23] (Finkelstein J), [74] (Rares J) and [130] (Gordon J); see also Bradken Resources Pty Ltd v Lynx Engineering Consultants Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1257 at [28] (Emmett J); Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd [2008] FCA 1920 at [6] (Finkelstein J). Ultimately, the court must consider whether there are any real, as opposed to fanciful, issues of fact or law that require proper determination at a trial. In assessing whether there are reasonable prospects of success, the court should draw all reasonable inferences (but only reasonable inferences) in favour of the non-moving party: see Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [132] (Gordon J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1431">That need for caution is reflected in the approach to the application of s 31A adopted by judges of this Court.

 It is necessary to refer in some detail to the circumstances that have given rise to the current litigation and this application for summary judgment.

Notwithstanding the force of the submissions, I will not strike out those parts of the defence. There are two reasons. First the issues raised by the defence are to be litigated in the claim against ASIC. It is not uncommon for a strike out application to be refused when it will not change the course of the trial: Imobilari Pty Ltd (ACN 091 464 729) v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd (in liq) (recs and mgrs apptd) (ACN 086 294 028) [2008] FCA 1920 ; (2008) 252 ALR 41 , 48. Second, it is possible that Mr Carey may establish that the money paid to WPC was not lost (ie irrecoverable) until the collapse of the group which, according to Mr Carey, was caused by the winding up applications. In particular, while the evidence may show the directors breached their duties by allowing the funds that had been raised to be paid to WPC, for purposes of determining what damages flow from those breaches regard may had to later events: Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns (A Firm) [1995] UKHL 10 ; [1995] UKHL 10 ; [1996] 1 AC 421 , 437 ("But the fact that there is an accrued cause of action as soon as the breach is committed does not in my judgment mean that the quantum of the compensation payable is ultimately fixed as at the date when the breach occurred.
