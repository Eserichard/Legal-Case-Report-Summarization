<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 318">It appears that the "one last opportunity" was to no avail. In Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (ACN 064 829 616) (No 3) [2009] FCA 53 Finn J made a summary order under s 31A of the Federal Court Act giving judgment for the respondents in relation to the whole proceeding. His Honour observed that normally it would not be necessary to conduct a detailed examination of the materials put on by the parties before making such an order but stated, at [68]: 
 
 The evolving manner in which Mr Kowalski has perceived his grievances and has formulated them to secure the relief he has in mind, has necessitated that I conduct in essence a "preliminary trial".

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1170">On two occasions Finn J refused to summarily dismiss this application, and gave the applicant leave to file and serve an amended application and statement of claim: see Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1069 ; (2007) 242 ALR 370 and Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 691. On a third occasion, 5 February 2009, his Honour struck out the applicant's further amended statement of claim, and the proceeding was summarily dismissed pursuant to s 31A of the FCA Act. His Honour found that the applicant's claim that a benefit should have been paid to him on the cessation of his employment in 1994 had no reasonable prospects of success on the basis that no formal application was made to the Trustee at that time and there was no evidence that the Trustee was informed of, or provided with, any medical evidence as to his entitlement. In relation to the claim that the Trustee should have considered his entitlement to a benefit in November 1998, his Honour found that there were also no reasonable prospects of success as again no formal application was made to the Trustee at that time. In relation to the Trustee's treatment of his application for the benefit in 2005, his Honour held that it also enjoyed no reasonable prospects of success as it was clear that the Trustee had considered and reconsidered his claim on a number of occasions between 1999 and 2005, and the Trustee was entitled to decline to re-entertain the same matter in the absence of a change of circumstances. His Honour further found that none of the breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty claims raised by the applicant had any reasonable prospects of success: see Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 53.  The proposed amendments are also to include a claim based on an alleged refusal to determine a purported claim for TPDB on 26 October 1998. The respondent says no formal application for TPDB was made on or around that date. In fact that is a question which has already been determined by this Court in Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 53: see [21] above. I do not see why the applicant should be able to re-agitate this question. I am satisfied that the proposed claim is made vexatiously and is an abuse of process and thus refuse leave to amend the application to include this claim. </sentence>
