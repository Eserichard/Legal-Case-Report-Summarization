<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 2073">21 As Edmonds J explained in Elsinora Global Ltd v Healthscope Ltd (No. 2) [2006] FCA 18 ; (2006) 61 ATR 482 at [63] :
 
 
 Subsection 260- 5 (3) of Sch 1 to the Administration Act is a deeming provision. It provides when a person (the third party) is taken to owe money to another (the debtor). In its form and context it is exhaustive and extends to situations where, but for the deeming, the third party may not, or would not, be regarded as owing money to the debtor.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] HCA 54">Notice under par (a) was treated as a "trigger" activating the operative provisions of s 255(1) [61] and a generally similar approach was adopted in Elsinora [62] . Two decisions about s 255 
 
 
 Reference was made in argument to only two other decisions in which the construction and application of s 255 has been considered: Commissioner of Taxation v Wong [59] and Elsinora Global Ltd v Healthscope Ltd (No 2) [60] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] HCATrans 469">For completeness, the corresponding paragraphs or the paragraphs in Elsinora , the judgment of Justice Edmonds, where his Honour agreed with what Justice Lindgren had there said, is Elsinora [2006] FCA 18 ; 227 ALR 570 at 582, which is paragraph [52], and 590, which is paragraph [98].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] HCATrans 466">Your Honours, the other case is a decision of Justice Edmonds in Elsinora Global Ltd v Healthscope Ltd [2006] FCA 18 ; (2006) 227 ALR 570 at page 582 and perhaps I could simply refer to paragraph [53] of those reasons where his Honour said:

 
 However, in Wong , Lindgren J made it quite clear .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] NSWCA 360">
 

127 In Elsinora Global Ltd v Healthscope Ltd (No. 2) [2006] FCA 18 ; (2006) 61 ATR 482 , Edmonds J considered a number of issues relating to the operation of s 255. His Honour determined a question only indirectly addressed by Lindgren J in Wong , namely that the obligations under s 255(1) could attach where the recipient of notification did not have control of money belonging to a non-resident at the time of notification: at [51]-[52]. His Honour also affirmed the view expressed in Wong that "notice or other communication of requirement pursuant to para (a) is the 'trigger' which activates the operative provision of s 255(1) , in particular that without that requirement, the provisions of paras (b), (c) and (d) are not activated": at [53]. Consistently with the language of s 255(1) , his Honour was correct to avoid the precise language of a notice, and refer to "notice or other communication of" the relevant requirement. 28 The notice under s255(1) ITAA is said to be the "trigger" that activates the operative provisions ( Commissioner of Taxation v Wong [2002] FCA 756 ; (2002) 121 FCR 60 per Lindgren J at 23): [79]. His Honour considered Elsinora Global Ltd v Healthscope Ltd [2006] FCA 18 ; (2005) 227 ALR 570 ; 2006 ATC 4061. That case held that it is not necessary for the person receiving the notice to have " receipt control or disposal " of the money belonging to the non-resident at the time of the notice. The operative provisions will be triggered if and when the person subsequently has the " receipt, control or disposal " of the money: [81]. Further, money so received will belong to a non-resident where there is an obligation annexed to the relevant money in favour of the non-resident: [81]. In Elsinora (supra) the court considered the decision in Clyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 40 ; (1981) 150 CLR 1. There it was held that notices under s218 ITAA prevented any subsequent dealing with the money in question that would preclude compliance with the notice when the time for compliance arrived. Subsequent actions by a taxpayer could not render the requirement nugatory or ineffective: [83]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] FCAFC 156">3 The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation abandoned her appeal from the decision of Edmonds J in Elsinora Global Ltd v Healthscope Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 18 ; (2006) 227 ALR 570. As a result, the only issues before the Court are those raised by the cross-appeal instituted by the first to sixth cross-appellants.</sentence>
