<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] SAIRC 67">In considering this application I take into account the applicable principles summarised by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Plancor v LHMU. [2] I also proceed on the basis that the court has a discretion whether or not to impose any pecuniary penalty in relation to a proven contravention. [3] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 384">My mind has fluctuated whether any penalty is required to be imposed on either Essendene or Mr Ryan in relation to Essendene's failure to pay the fairness test compensation amounts to Messrs Martin and Wright when they became due 14 days after notice of the Director's decisions that their AWAs did not pass the fairness test. Notwithstanding that breaches are conceded, the Court has a discretion not to impose a penalty (see Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 1607 at [13] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 246">It should be clear from what I have said above that I do not regard the University's conduct as some minor infringement which can be assuaged by a small fine. On the other hand it cannot be said that this is a breach at the most serious end of the spectrum. The penalty that should be imposed must reflect the views of the court as to the seriousness of the breach but should take into account those ameliorating factors which have been discussed. I am of the view that an appropriate penalty in this particular case is 91 penalty units or $10,010.00. The applicant seeks that, pursuant to s.841 of the Act, the court order that the penalty be paid to it although it should be noted that any penalty should not be imposed merely for the purposes of reimbursing an applicant for its costs; Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Telstra Corporation Limited [2007] FCA 1607 at [19] . I trust it is clear from these reasons that the basis and scope of the penalty is in no way connected to the applicant's costs of the proceedings and in those circumstances I make an order that the penalty shall be paid to the applicant within twenty-eight days. 
 I certify that the preceding twelve (12) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Raphael FM

  I have been considerably assisted by the provision by both parties of written submissions. In each case I was referred to a number of factors that a court should take into account when coming to a conclusion upon penalty and fully accept the usefulness of such lists exemplified in the Judgment of Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 applied by Finkelstein J in ANWU v Mechanical Engineering Services Pty Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 1249 at [10] and by Gordon J in Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 1607. The matters referred to in Kelly were: "a. The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCAFC 170">62 Although the penalty imposed by Merkel J in Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia was reduced on appeal to the Full Court, no criticism was made by the Full Court of the above observations of his Honour (see Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union [2007] FCAFC 18 ; (2007) 157 FCR 329). We consider it appropriate to endorse them. See also McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 1302 ; (2006) 158 IR 181 at [108] and Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia Services Union of Australia v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 1607 at [18] ).</sentence>
