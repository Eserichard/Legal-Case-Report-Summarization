<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCAFC 191">1 On 31 August 2006 the Minister for Justice and Customs (as delegate of the Attorney-General) (the Minister) made a surrender determination relating to the appellant, Lawrence Rivera, pursuant to s 22 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) (the Act).

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCAFC 123">108 In the present case the primary judge, in the decision under appeal ( Rivera v Minister for Justice and Customs [2006] FCA 1784) described the passage of the first three stages as follows at [2] to [3]:
 
 '2. On 19 September 2002, the applicant was arrested in Orange in New South Wales under a provisional arrest warrant issued by a magistrate on 4 September 2002 under s 12 of the Act. The applicant has been detained in custody since that time. On 12 November 2002, the Minister received an extradition request from the United States for the applicant's extradition, in relation to one count of murder, contrary to s 187 of the Code. On 14 November 2002, the Minister issued a notice under s 16 of the Act, being a notice addressed to a magistrate stating that an extradition request had been received. 
 3. In December 2002, a magistrate determined that the applicant was eligible for surrender and committed him to prison to await surrender, pursuant to s 19(9) of the Act. The applicant unsuccessfully challenged the magistrate's decision, or his eligibility for surrender, in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the Full Court of the Federal Court, and the High Court.
