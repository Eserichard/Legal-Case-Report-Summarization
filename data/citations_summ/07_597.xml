<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 30">The decision in Chapman v Queensland [2007] FCA 597 ; (2007) 159 FCR 507 ( Chapman v Queensland ) does not assist the appellants. In Chapman v Queensland , Kiefel J held that the Court had power, outside the scope of s 66B , to order the replacement of an applicant and amendment of the Register. In that context Kiefel J also observed (at [16]) that the Registrar would have an implied power to amend the Register in a case where an applicant clearly could not continue to represent the native title claim group, such as by reason of death.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 993">The respondents relied upon Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56 and Chapman v Queensland [2007] FCA 597 ; (2007) 159 FCR 507 to support this second submission. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 743">There is no direct decision on the point. Decisions to the same effect have been given under the NT Act, as it stood prior to the amendments to the NT Act effected by the Native Title Amendment (Technical Amendments) Act 2007 (Cth) (the 2007 Amending Act). Those decisions are: Butchulla People v Queensland and Others [2006] FCA 1063 ; (2006) 154 FCR 233 ( Butchulla ), Chapman and Others v Queensland and Others [2007] FCA 597 ; (2007) 159 FCR 507 ( Chapman ) and Doolan and Others v Native Title Registrar and Others [2007] FCA 192 ; [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56 ( Doolan ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1575">14 The applicant movers rely particularly on the authority of Chapman v Queensland [2007] FCA 597 ; (2007) 159 FCR 507 ( Chapman ) to support their argument that Ms Wyatt and Mr Cooper could and should be removed as members of the applicant pursuant to O 6 r 9 of the Rules. The other parties submit that Chapman should not be followed.</sentence>

A careful reading of s 66B(1) indicates that the cumulative grounds upon which the motion under s 66B may be brought, that is, one of the two alternatives in ss (1)(a)(i) or (ii) and the ground in ss (1)(b), refer to the application for the determination of native title under s 61 of the Act. They focus upon the status of the current applicant to make the application or that applicant's conduct in relation to that application, and upon the putative applicant's authorisation to make and deal with matter arising in relation to that primary application. The status of the proposed new applicant to pursue the motion under s 66B require those cumulative conditions to be satisfied, but not necessarily an explicit separate authorisation by the claim group to seek an order under s 66B. That status already exists if there is an authorisation of the claim group under s 251B to make the claimant application itself and to deal with the matters arising in relation to it: see eg Ward v Northern Territory [2002] FCA 1477 ; (2002) 196 ALR 32 at 38, [15] . In Daniel 194 ALR at 296, [53] that particular issue does not appear to have been contentious or therefore to have required particular remark. Nor, in my view, did it arise in Chapman v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 597 ; (2007) 159 FCR 507 to which my attention was drawn by senior counsel for Marjorie Foster.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] NNTTA 114">In this regard there have been three decisions that must be considered by the Tribunal --- Butchulla People v Queensland [2006] FCA 1063 ; (2006) 154 FCR 233 (Kiefel J), Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56 (Spender J) and Chapman v Queensland [2007] FCA 597 ; (2007) 159 FCR 507 (Kiefel J). In Chapman v Queensland [2007] FCA 597 ; (2007) 159 FCR 507 Kiefel J noted (510/[9] ---[10]): 
 
 " The continuance of authorisation must depend upon the terms of the authorisation, a matter upon which NTA did not speak...the question as to the terms of authorisation in any given case is one of fact and the presumption may yield to other indicia of the intention of those authorising.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1054">14 Section 66B of the Act provides for a procedure for the replacement of the applicant ( Chapman on behalf of the Wakka Wakka People # 2 v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 597 per Kiefel J at [2]). Under subs 66B(1)(a)(i), members of a claim group who seek to replace an existing applicant must relevantly establish ( Daniel v The State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 1147 ; (2002) 194 ALR 278 per French J at [17]) that:
 
(1) There is a claimant application. (2) Each applicant for an order under s 66B is a member of the claim group. 
 (3) The persons to be replaced are no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it. (4) The persons making the application under s 66B are authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it. </sentence>
