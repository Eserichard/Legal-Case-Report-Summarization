<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 815">5 On 11 April 2007, I struck out that defence as an abuse of process. Until this action, and indeed during its currency, the owner had consistently and publicly acknowledged the existence of the agreement and of the mortgage of the vessel, and in any event the person who signed the agreement and the mortgage on behalf of the owner was (on the uncontested evidence) the chairman of the board of directors of the owner and authorised to sign the agreement and the mortgage under the owner's constitution: see Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v The Ship MV "Mawashi Al Gasseem" [2007] FCA 550. The owner was given leave within a specified period to file and serve an amended or fresh defence. It has not done so.</sentence>
