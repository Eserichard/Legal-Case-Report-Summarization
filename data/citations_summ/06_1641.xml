<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 406">The applicant does not identify the manner in which the Tribunal is said to have erred in its application of the law. The relevant statutory scheme (ss.65 and 36 (2) of the Migration Act ) requires the Tribunal to reach a requisite level of satisfaction as to the criterion set out, relevantly, in s.36(2). Satisfaction of the criteria for the grant of the visa depends not on a particular matter being established but on the Minister (or the Tribunal standing in the shoes of the Minister) attaining a state of satisfaction as to a number of matters which have to exist for Australia to have protection obligations to an applicant under the Refugees Convention. [4] There is no legal principle which requires the Tribunal to give an applicant the benefit of the doubt. [5] Nor is the Tribunal under any obligation to uncritically accept any and all allegations made by an applicant. [6] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 207">In particular this issue has been addressed in SZHIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [6] where Jacobson J held at [10]- [11] that: The first ground [of appeal] is that the Tribunal committed a jurisdictional error because it did not afford the appellant the benefit of the doubt when there was no material to the contrary of that which the appellant asserted. However, it is clear in my view that this ground of appeal cannot succeed because it is contrary to the well established principles that apply to the provisions of s.65 of the Migration Act . </sentence>
