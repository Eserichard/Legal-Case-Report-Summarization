<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 32">In such a situation, it will not be enough to ask whether the applicant has shown a serious question, or a probability of success, on his or her own case. While the answer to that question may be in the affirmative, it will then be necessary to consider whether that answer should be qualified by the apparent strength of the defence. In a patent case, the fact of registration constitutes prima facie evidence of validity: AB Hassle v Pharmacia (Aust) Pty Ltd (1995) 33 IPR 63 at 69---70 ( AB Hassle ); GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis (2007) 73 IPR 502; [2007] FCA 1485 at [2]---[6] ( GenRx ). It has been said that it is for the respondent to show that want of validity is a triable question: AB Hassle at 69. This seems clear enough, but, in my opinion, the analysis needs to be taken a step further.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 949">The practice to which their Honours referred is no longer the practice of the courts. This much appears from the authorities to which counsel for the applicants referred me, including AB Hassle v Pharmacia (Australia) Pty Ltd (1995) 33 IPR 63 , Genrx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 , and Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498 ; (2008) 79 IPR 261. The reason for the change in practice is that the legislative requirements for grant of a patent are more exacting than they once were and include provision for opposition proceedings before the grant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 945">Gummow J's analysis has been applied by Moore J in Merck and Co Inc v GenRx Pty Ltd (2006) 70 IPR 286 ; [2006] FCA 1407 , Gyles J in GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis (2007) 73 IPR 502 ; [2007] FCA 1485 , Jessup J in Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents (2008) 79 IPR 261 ; [2008] FCA 1498 and, of course, Sundberg J in the Sigma decision.  As to this, in Interpharma [2008] FCA 1498 ; 79 IPR 261 at [17] Jessup J said: 

 
In such a situation, it will not be enough to ask whether the applicant has shown a serious question, or a probability of success, on his or her own case. While the answer to that question may be in the affirmative, it will then be necessary to consider whether that answer should be qualified by the apparent strength of the defence.

It has been said that it is for the respondent to show that want of validity is a triable question: AB Hassle at 69. This seems clear enough, but, in my opinion, the analysis needs to be taken a step further.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 630">The applicants appeared, at least impliedly, to accept that the claims in the Patent should be construed in the first of the ways suggested by Mr Munt. I have, for present purposes, adopted the same interpretation. I have also been influenced by the fact that the Patent has been registered for a considerable time during which the applicants or their predecessors have enjoyed it undisturbed. As Gyles J explained in Genrx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 , at 503-504 [4]-[6], that factor is permitted a degree of influence by the Beecham Group case (supra) as explained in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (supra) and Martin Engineering Co v Trison Holdings Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 543 ; 11 IPR 611.  However, arguments similar to those advanced by Smith &amp; Nephew in this case to the effect that it now be allowed into the market pending a resolution of the patent dispute between the parties were rejected by Gyles J in GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 where his Honour said, at 506; 
 'I am much influenced by the effects of disturbing the status quo, particularly as it relates to the operation of the PBS. A new entrant in this field would have an effect which may be both unpredictable and irreversible. There is also likely to be interference with the trade patterns of Sanofi with its customers, both wholesale and retail, that may not be detectable or measurable in money terms... Temporary disturbance of that status quo is not justified. My view is consistent with that of Moore J in Merck &amp; Co Inc v Genrx Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1407 ; (2006) 70 IPR 286. '

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 595">As to this, in Interpharma [2008] FCA 1498 ; 79 IPR 261 at [17] Jessup J said:

It has been said that it is for the respondent to show that want of validity is a triable question: AB Hassle at 69. This seems clear enough, but, in my opinion, the analysis needs to be taken a step further. The purpose of an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo pending trial. What was said by Gyles J in GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 at [15] is applicable here. A new entrant into the market would have an effect which may be both unpredictable and irreversible. Once Sigma is in the market, it is likely that other generic manufacturers will also come in. I doubt whether, if Sigma is not restrained and Wyeth succeeds at trial, Wyeth will ever be able to resume the position it now occupies. Cf Interpharma [2008] FCA 1498 ; 79 IPR 261 at [71] . In my view it is likely that Wyeth will suffer irreparable harm for which damages will not adequately compensate it, unless an injunction is granted. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 313">Furthermore, once a generic is released into the market for PBS products, it would be likely to have the effect of reducing Wyeth's market share. As Gyles J observed in GenRx Pty Limited v Sanofi---Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 at [15] . 
 A new entrant ... would have an effect which may be both unpredictable and irreversible.
