<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NNTTA 210">A majority-decision making process is not consistent with the requirements of the Act. However, this does not mean that there must be unanimity amongst all of the persons comprising the Applicant. The Act contemplates authorisation or execution by so many of the persons comprising the Applicant who continue to be willing and able to discharge their statutory responsibilities --- Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56 at [56] --- [59]. [47] Accordingly, it is important when determining whether a consent determination is open to the Tribunal to ascertain why all of the persons comprising the Applicant have failed to execute a future act agreement. Where such failure is unrelated to the agreement and relates to a failure to discharge the responsibilities of an Applicant then, following Doolan , it is open to the Tribunal to make a consent determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1019">In Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56 ; [2007] FCA 192 (at [61]), Spender J referred to the Second Reading Speech of the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, on the Native Title Bill 1993 as quoted by McHugh J in Commonwealth v Yarmirr (2001) 208 CLR 1 ; [2001] HCA 56 (at [124]---[125]), that: " If the purpose of the Act was to recognise native title in any case where Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people still possessed rights and interests in respect of land or waters under their traditional laws or customs, the duty of the courts would be to ensure that that purpose was achieved ". See also the observations of Mansfield J to the same effect in Lennon v State of South Australia [2010] FCA 743 (" Lennon ") at [23]---[25]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 993">The respondents relied upon Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56 and Chapman v Queensland [2007] FCA 597 ; (2007) 159 FCR 507 to support this second submission.  
 
 
 

 I adhere to that view for the reasons given. A contrary approach would mean that 'the applicant' in native title claim proceedings would cease to exist if it transpired that just one of the persons making up 'the applicant' was not a member of the claim group or died and involve the considerable expense of undertaking another authorisation meeting of the entire group. I note that the decision in the Butchulla People's application has been followed by Spender J in Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192. The approach which I consider to be open does not limit the grounds for the effective removal of a person to those in s 66B(1), rather it gives effect to the basis upon which authorisation was originally made. It should not be inferred that it was intended that s 66B(1) be the only means by which the constitution of the applicant in proceedings before the Court can be altered.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 743">There is no direct decision on the point. Decisions to the same effect have been given under the NT Act, as it stood prior to the amendments to the NT Act effected by the Native Title Amendment (Technical Amendments) Act 2007 (Cth) (the 2007 Amending Act). Those decisions are: Butchulla People v Queensland and Others [2006] FCA 1063 ; (2006) 154 FCR 233 ( Butchulla ), Chapman and Others v Queensland and Others [2007] FCA 597 ; (2007) 159 FCR 507 ( Chapman ) and Doolan and Others v Native Title Registrar and Others [2007] FCA 192 ; [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56 ( Doolan ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] NNTTA 54">It is also the case that in a number of decisions, the Federal Court has looked beyond the persons comprising the Applicant to ascertain what are the wishes and aspirations of the claim group, and has held that unanimity is not necessarily a pre-requisite for action by the Applicant: see Butchulla People v Queensland [2006] FCA 1063 ; (2006) 154 FCR 233 and Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] NNTTA 179">In effect they have a fiduciary obligation to the broader claim group and the position of "Applicant" does not involve a personal right: see Button v Chapman [2003] FCA 861 at [9] , Butchulla People v Queensland [2006] FCA 1063 ; (2006) 154 FCR 233 , Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] NNTTA 171">[19] The Tribunal has traditionally taken a liberal approach to the making of consent determinations. One recent example of such an approach is Leedham Papertalk &amp; Ors on behalf of the Mullewa Wadjari Community/Western Australia/Aurox Resources Ltd, [2009] NNTTA 159 (30 November 2009) (" Leedham Papertalk") . It is also the case that in a number of decisions, the Federal Court has looked beyond the persons comprising the Applicant to ascertain what are the wishes and aspirations of the claim group, and has held that unanimity is not necessarily a pre-requisite for action by the Applicant: see Butchulla People v Queensland [2006] FCA 1063 ; (2006) 154 FCR 233 and Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56. Whether that principle of law should be followed subsequent to the 2007 amendments to the Act (see Sambo v Western Australia [2008] FCA 1575) , is not necessary to consider for present purposes. What is clear is that it is appropriate, in particular circumstances, for the Tribunal to look beyond the persons comprising the Applicant to ascertain what are the wishes of the broader claim group when determining whether the make a consent determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 1575">22 In Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56 , Spender J followed the reasoning of Kiefel J in Butchulla People . 24 At 511 of Chapman ([12]-[13]), her Honour reaffirmed the view she had expressed in Butchulla People and continued:
 A contrary approach would mean that "the applicant" in native title claim proceedings would cease to exist if it transpired that just one of the persons making up "the applicant" was not a member of the claim group or died and involve the considerable expense of undertaking another authorisation meeting of the entire group. I note that the decision in the Butchulla People's application has been followed by Spender J in Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56. The approach which I consider to be open does not limit the grounds for the effective removal of a person to those in s 66B(1), rather it gives effect to the basis upon which authorisation was originally made. It should not be inferred that it was intended that s 66B(1) be the only means by which the constitution of the applicant in proceedings before the Court can be altered. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] NNTTA 96">The persons collectively comprising the Applicant of the second and third native title parties are capable of executing s.31(1)(b) agreements and for those agreements to be binding on the contracting parties --- Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 1888">8 Before moving to the requirements of s 66B, there are two technical matters that are necessary to address. First, the section refers to replacing "the applicant", which is defined in s 253 by reference to s 61(2) to include jointly all of the persons authorised under s 253 to make the application. Thus, the motion under s 66B should be to replace all of the named applicants, despite the fact it proposes that some of them are to retain their status (see Daniel [2002] FCA 1147 ; 194 ALR 278 at [5] ; Combined Mandingalbay Yidinji-Gunggandji Claim v State of Queensland [2004] FCA 1703 at [46] ). That is a practical, but not a substantive, issue where not all of the persons who are named applicants are sought to be replaced, but it is not inconsistent with recent authorities which hold that authorisation under s 251B is held by persons individually, rather than by those persons jointly as "the applicant" (see Butchulla People v Queensland [2006] FCA 1063 ; (2006) 154 FCR 233 at [45] ; Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56 at [60] ). In this matter, the terms of the motion intended, and would practically operate, to remove only Ms Foster as a named applicant and to replace her with her daughter, Margaret Foster, another member of the Kamu people. The other named applicants would retain their status. But, the motion may be regarded alternatively as achieving that purpose by seeking to replace "the applicant" including all of the named applicants, and replacing them with a new "applicant" including the existing named applicants except for Marjorie Foster and adding Margaret Foster.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] NNTTA 114">In this regard there have been three decisions that must be considered by the Tribunal --- Butchulla People v Queensland [2006] FCA 1063 ; (2006) 154 FCR 233 (Kiefel J), Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56 (Spender J) and Chapman v Queensland [2007] FCA 597 ; (2007) 159 FCR 507 (Kiefel J). The remaining persons who collectively comprise the applicant of the second native title party are capable of executing the ancillary agreement and for that document to be binding on the parties --- Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] NNTTA 113">More recently Spender J in Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 made the following observations: 

 "57 However, I think that an appointment of a group of persons jointly to be an 'applicant' by a meeting of a native title claim group is an authorisation for the named persons to act, or so many of them as remaining willing and able to act.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCA 597">12 I adhere to that view for the reasons given. A contrary approach would mean that 'the applicant' in native title claim proceedings would cease to exist if it transpired that just one of the persons making up 'the applicant' was not a member of the claim group or died and involve the considerable expense of undertaking another authorisation meeting of the entire group.
