<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 166">I am asked by the applicant to award costs on an indemnity basis on the basis that it was unreasonable for the respondent to have subjected the applicant to the expenditure of costs. Reliance was placed in that respect on the decision in Liquor, Hospitality &amp; Miscellaneous Union v The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Perth [2008] FCA 457 at [23] --- [24] in which costs were awarded on an indemnity basis based on the " unreasonableness" of the applicant's subjecting the " innocent party" to the expenditure of costs. That case dealt with the issue of whether a motion had been instituted by an applicant without reasonable cause and whether pursuit of the motion involved unreasonable acts or omissions. That is a somewhat different context from this situation. </sentence>
