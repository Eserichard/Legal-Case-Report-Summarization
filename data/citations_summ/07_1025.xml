<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1343">In considering the effect of these words, it is important to identify what it is that s 87(1A) requires the Court to consider appropriate. The wording of the section makes it clear that the question for the Court is whether it is appropriate to make an order in the terms of the agreement reached between the parties. Therefore the central focus of the section is that agreement: Lovett v Victoria [2007] FCA 474 (" Lovett ") at [37]; Nangkiriny v Western Australia (2002) 117 FCR 6 ; [2002] FCA 660 at [8] ; James v Western Australia [2002] FCA 1208 at [4] ; Ward v Western Australia [2006] FCA 1848 at [9] ; Cox v Western Australia [2007] FCA 588 at [12] ; Brown v Western Australia [2007] FCA 1025 at [23] ; Hughes v Western Australia [2007] FCA 365 at [9] ; Kogolo v Western Australia [2007] FCA 1703 at [18] and Eringa v South Australia [2008] FCA 1370 (" Eringa ") at [33]. </sentence>

The Court's power must be exercised flexibly and with this purpose in mind. I am satisfied that the Court has power to make the determinations in the terms proposed by the parties by agreement, and that these orders can appropriately be made to give effect to the parties' agreement without a full hearing of the Applicant's claim. Such orders determine under the laws of Australia that Native Title exists in the Determination Areas according to the traditional laws and customs of the Gangalidda People. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 498">[213] Question 5: If the answer to (4) is "yes", in which areas has native title been wholly extinguished? [219] CONCLUSION [229] 
 INTRODUCTION 
 The applicants claim native title over certain land in Western Australia. A consent determination was made in respect of part of the land over which the applicants claimed native title ( Brown (on behalf of the Ngarla People) v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 1025 ( Brown No 1 )). In that consent determination some areas, designated Determination Area B and set out in the Second Schedule to the determination, were specifically excluded. One part of Determination Area B was an area subject to two mineral leases granted pursuant to the agreement ( the Agreement ) amended and ratified by the Iron Ore (Mount Goldsworthy) Agreement Act 1964 (WA) ( the Agreement Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 944">The parties, however, submit that it could equally be made under s 87. They say that the agreement they have reached relates both to "an area ... included in the area covered by the application" (s 87A(1)(b)) and "part of the proceedings" (s 87(1)(a)(ii); s 87(3)). In this connection reference is made to Brown (On behalf of the Ngarla People) v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 1025 at [14] . The parties note that following the repeal of s 87(1)(d) the Court no longer has first to consider whether an order should be made under s 87A rather than under s 87. They submit, however, that where it is possible for an order to be made under both sections it is preferable to use s 87A.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 710"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1703">The Court's jurisdiction to hear and determine native title applications is specifically provided for by the Act in s 81. This jurisdiction expressly includes the power to make orders by consent pursuant to s 87A. These statutory provisions make it clear that the Court's jurisdiction is enlivened. It should, however, be noted that the agreement in this case relates to part of the land and waters the subject of the Ngurrara application. The making of a determination of native title in respect of part of an application is a matter that falls within both s 87(3) and s 87A of the Act. It follows that the Court may make orders determining that native title exists in relation to Determination Area A while leaving the issues outstanding in relation to Determination Area B for resolution at a later date (Munn (for and on behalf of the Gunggari People) v State of Queensland [2001] FCA 1229 ; (2001) 115 FCR 109 at [6] ). This approach has been taken in a number of cases in Western Australia under s 87 (Nangkiriny v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 660 ; (2002) 117 FCR 6 ; Nangkiriny v Western Australia [2004] FCA 1156 ; James on behalf of the Martu People v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 1208 ; Hughes (on behalf of the Eastern Guruma People) v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 365) and under alternatively s 87 and s 87A ( Brown (on behalf of the Ngarla People) v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 1025). </sentence>
