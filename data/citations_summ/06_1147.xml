<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 361">Notwithstanding the deficiencies in the Amended Statement of Claim , it is considered that the present pleading stands in contrast to that in Tepperova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1147 , 91 ALD 620. Finn J there dismissed a claim by reason of the " rolled up " nature of the pleading at [32] to [34]. The contrast lies in the degree of detail as to the involvement of each of the individual Respondents found elsewhere in the Amended Statement of Claim and the statement of the purposes each is said to have pursued at paragraph [75]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 530">40 The statement of claim is embarrassing and must be struck out under O 11 r 16 of the Rules. The Applicant has been given a chance to amend his pleadings. He has not done so. He says he cannot improve on the document. With that in mind, I will not give further leave to file an amended statement of claim: see Tepperova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1147 ; (2006) 91 ALD 620 , at 625. As the claim cannot be properly pleaded, the application itself should also be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1688">28 Section 31A commenced operation on 1 December 2005. It applies only in relation to "proceedings commenced on or after the commencement day": see item 44 of Sch 1 to the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 , and item 7 of that Act which inserted s 31A into the FCA Act. The Commissioner has submitted that s 31A applies in this instance because the Amended Application and the Amended Statement of Claim were filed only on 15 August 2006, and that the assertion in this proceeding seeking to invalidate the Notices by reason of improper conduct on the part of officers of the respondent was first made only by the "Statement of Claim" filed on 7 July 2006. The effect of the "Statement of Claim" first filed on 7 July 2006 would appear, by O 13 rr 3(3) and 3A of the Federal Court Rules , to operate from that day as a proceeding commenced on or after that day: see Tepperova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1147 at [27] . I do not need, however, to decide that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 1227">Merck submitted that the section provided a lesser test that the test which applies under the other provisions. It referred to observations of Heerey J in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 , in which his Honour said at [6]: 
 
 s 31A was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeouts (either of claims or defences) than that previously laid down by the High Court&#180;s decisions in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1948) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130, namely that the allegations are 'so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed'. " 
 

See also, in relation to s 31A: Vans, Inc v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 , Garrett v Macks [2006] FCA 601 , Mobileworld Operating Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 743 , Wearne v Southern Cross University [2006] FCA 1033 , Unilin Beheer BV v Shun Li De Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 534 , Tepperova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1147.
