<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 131">68 Plainly enough, s 7(4) defines use of the trade mark as not only the application of the mark to the goods themselves, but also the application of the mark to other items relating to the goods, such as labels, advertisements, invoices or other documents relating to goods: see Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off at [5.1430], Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670 at 686 per Aickin J, Angoves Pty Ltd v Johnson [1982] FCA 108 ; (1982) 43 ALR 349 at 359-360 per Deane J, and Brother Industries Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1490 ; (2007) 73 IPR 507 at 521 [54] per Tamberlin J. Thus, in Thunderbird Products Corporation v Thunderbird Marine Products Pty Ltd [1974] HCA 51 ; (1974) 131 CLR 592 at 600, Jacobs J accepted that use of the mark in relation to the goods in question (which was a boat) was constituted by the use of the mark in relation to the goods on invoices, correspondence, shipping documents and brochures.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 27">Later authorities which have considered this passage do not suggest it should be understood differently: Carnival Cruise Lines Inc v Sitmar Cruises Limited [1994] FCA 936 ; (1994) 120 ALR 495 at 510 per Gummow J; Transport Tyre Sales Pty Ltd v Montana Tyres Rims &amp; Tubes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 329 ; (1999) 93 FCR 421 at [68] - [70] per the Full Court; Asia Television Ltd v Yau's Entertainment Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 838 ; (2000) 49 IPR 264 at [9] per Gyles J; and Brother Industries Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1490 ; (2007) 163 FCR 530 at [42] and [45] per Tamberlin J; Pioneer Electronic Corporation v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670 at 688; Ward Group Pty Ltd v Brodie &amp; Stone plc [2005] FCA 471 ; (2005) 143 FCR 479 at 489. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] ATMO 88">As to whether the applicant's current mode of use is actually "use", in Brother Industries Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1490 , Tamberlin J said: 
54 Section 7(4) defines 'use' of a trade mark not only as the application of the mark to the product itself, but also the application of the mark to other items relating to the product, such as packaging, invoices, correspondence and advertisements: see Thunderbird Products Corporation v Thunderbird Marine Products Pty Ltd [1974] HCA 51 ; (1974) 131 CLR 592 at 600 (per Jacobs J); Angoves Pty Ltd v Johnson (1982) [1982] FCA 108 ; 43 ALR 349 at 359-360 (per Deane J); Davison M, Johnston K and Kennedy P, Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks &amp; Passing Off (3 rd ed, Lawbook Co., 2003) at [2.145] and [2.230]. Sections 9(1)(b)(i) , 9 (1)(c)(ii) and 9 (2) of the Act provide that a trade mark used on an invoice or attached to either the packaging in which the product is stored or transported is to be taken as being applied in relation to the goods. Accordingly, the use of the Sample Packaging or invoices displaying the mark in respect of the Sample Units is 'use' of a trade mark within s 7 of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 970">21 Before proceeding any further, I first note in Brother Industries Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1490 ; (2007) 163 FCR 530 at [53] - [54], Tamberlin J pointed out that under ss 7 and 9 of the TMA, a trade mark is taken to be used in relation to goods and services if it is applied to, among other things, packaging labels, signs, invoices, business letters, and business papers. Here, the word "Liquideng" was applied by Edwards and LFS in just such ways. It follows that application of that word was its use as a trade mark. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 934">145 In Estex Clothing the goods exported were being forwarded from England to Australia, and it is not considered that the language employed by their Honours should be construed as contemplating anything beyond what they literally said. By exporting the goods from England into Australia the " overseas manufacturer projects into the course of trade in this country ... goods bearing his mark ". Such other authorities also seem to contemplate that there has to be an export of goods from overseas into Australia. Thus, in Brother Industries Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1490 , 163 FCR 530 , Tamberlin J referred to Estex Clothing and summarised its effect as follows:
 [42] ... Put another way, where an overseas company has registered a trade mark in Australia for products it exports to the Australian market, then it is that company, when and if it distributes the goods into Australia, which can be said to have "used" its trade mark. See also: Asia Television Ltd v Yau's Entertainment Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 838 at [9] , [2000] FCA 838 ; 49 IPR 264 at 268 per Gyles J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 126">1 These reasons arise from an application by the applicants ("Brother") for an order for costs on an indemnity basis, having been substantially successful in proceedings against the respondent ("Dynamic Supplies") concerning infringement of trade marks and other matters: see Brother Industries, Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1490 ; (2007) 73 IPR 507. The application for indemnity costs relies not only on Dynamic Supplies' rejection of several offers of compromise made by Brother before the hearing but also on the manner in which the litigation was conducted by Dynamic Supplies.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1642">38 Finally, as noted above, the respondents have not pleaded reliance on s 123 of the 1995 Act in their Amended Defence. That is, they have not sought positively to assert that the counterfeit goods were not counterfeit because the marks in question were applied with the consent of the registered owner. Had they done so, then it would have been incumbent on them to make out their case: see Brother Industries, Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1490 at [72] per Tamberlin J. As things stand, even if they had relied on s 123, in the absence of evidence tending to support this assertion, there would be no reason to believe that they had any reasonable prospect of succeeding on a s 123 defence. </sentence>
