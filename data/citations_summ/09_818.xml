<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 380">It was not disputed that the principles referred to in Appellant P119/2002 (which have been followed or cited with approval on numerous occasions: for example WALN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 131 ; SZJZE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1653 ; SZJZS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 102 ALD 318 ; [2008] FCA 789 ; SZNCW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 818 ; SZHEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 783 ; SZGSI and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2009) 107 ALD 414 ; [2009] FCA 200) are applicable. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 107">Difficulty emerges at the outset if reference is made to the Ground itself, and not to what purport to be Particulars . It may properly be characterised as a challenge to the facts as found by the Tribunal. The resolution of factual questions is a matter entrusted to the Tribunal alone: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 , 58 ALD 609 at [67] ; SZNCW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 818 at [39] . Fact-finding, or reviewing the factual merits of a claim, is not the function of either the Federal Magistrates Court or this Court on appeal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1068">The integers of jurisdictional error arising out of mistranslation as articulated in P119/2002 , as extracted, appeared to have been accepted in a number of Federal Court decisions; WALN v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 131 per Ryan J (with whom Tamberlin and Middleton JJ agreed at [29]); SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 per Middleton J and SZJZS v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 789 per Flick J. In this year alone, three Judges of the Federal Court, hearing matters on appeal from this Court, have made direct reference and set out with approval the two criteria referred to in P119/2002. SZNCW v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 818 per Barker J; SZHEW v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 783 per Jagot J, where her Honour said at [49]; This approach reflects the reasoning of Kenny J in Perera v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1999) 92 FCR 6; [1999] FCA 507. " 
and in SZGSI v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 200 ; (2009) 107 ALD 414 per McKerracher J. In this Court, Smith FM dealt with an application in which the first ground of review argued that a critical mistranslation occurred in relation to one point.</sentence>
