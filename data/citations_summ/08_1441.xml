<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1292">The Commission's decision on both counts was affirmed by the Veterans' Review Board on 24 February 2006. The applicant's appeal to the Veterans' Appeal Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was similarly unsuccessful in relation to his claim for a pension in respect of his sleep apnoea. On 22 September 2009 the Federal Court set aside the Tribunal's decision and remitted the matter to the Tribunal for further consideration; [2008] FCA 1441 ; 104 ALD 406. The Court found that the Tribunal had made an error of law in failing to consider the effect of shift work as a contributing factor to the applicant's condition. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 680">This submission is to be rejected for two reasons. First , this is not how s 43(2B) has been repeatedly held to operate. The High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 331-332 [10] per Gleeson CJ, 349 [77] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ established that provisions like s 43(2B) do not require a decision maker to state findings it should have made but only to state the findings it has made; it is concerned, in other words, with the exposure by decision makers of their subjective reasoning processes. This proposition has been repeatedly applied in this Court: Appellant V324 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 259 at [8] per Hill and Allsop JJ, [54]-[55] per Stone J; Repatriation Commission v Cotton [2006] FCA 1523 ; (2006) 93 ALD 118 at 128 [42] per Rares J; Gilkinson v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1441 ; (2008) 104 ALD 406 at 410 [14] per Rares J; Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 253 ALR 263 at 270 [29] per Perram J; Alexander v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority [2010] FCA 189 ; (2010) 265 ALR 424 at 437 [66] per Bromberg J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 23">That decision was appealed to the Federal Court and on 22 September 2008 Rares J set aside the Tribunal's decision and directed the matter be remitted to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("AAT") to be reheard. See Gilkinson v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1441. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 49">The Authority's arguments as to the inadequacy of the Tribunal's reasons were based on these provisions. So far as the argument was based on s 43(2B) it must be rejected. The Full Court of this Court has held that that provision requires the Tribunal to do no more that to state the findings which it has actually made. It does not require the Tribunal to make the findings which it ought to have made: Appellant V324 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 259 at [8] per Hill and Allsop JJ; see also Repatriation Commission v Cotton [2006] FCA 1523 ; (2006) 93 ALD 118 at 128 [42] per Rares J; Gilkinson v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1441 ; (2008) 104 ALD 406 at 410 [14] per Rares J. That conclusion is inevitable in light of the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 331-332 [10] per Gleeson CJ, 349 [77] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ where it was held that s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) --- which is not materially different to s 43(2B) --- operated in that manner. </sentence>
