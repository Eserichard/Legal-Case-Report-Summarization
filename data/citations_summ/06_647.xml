<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] HCA 13">It claimed to be an "aggrieved person", and sought cancellation of the registration of "HEALTHPLUS" under s 88(1) of the Act [5] . It did so on the ground, inter alia, that Shin-Sun did not intend to use the mark "HEALTHPLUS" in Australia. On 31 May 2006 Health World overcame an obstacle raised by Shin-Sun to the first proceeding in relation to another contention: the primary judge held that the decision of Cooper J did not estop Health World from contending that Shin-Sun's mark "HEALTHPLUS" was substantially identical with or deceptively similar to Health World's mark "INNER HEALTH PLUS" [6] . 12 The second proceeding. On 25 July 2006 Health World instituted what may be called "the second proceeding" in the Federal Court.</sentence>

See also Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1517 ; (2003) 61 IPR 130 at [13] ; Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 647 ; (2006) 68 IPR 557 at [31] - [48] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 100">110 Second, this approach to construction is consistent with the scheme of the Act as discussed by a Full Court in Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2002] FCAFC 413 ; [2003] AIPC 91-839 at [18] . The Full Court there observed that opposition proceedings are quasi-summary and an unsuccessful opponent will have the opportunity to bring an expungement application if the opposition proceeding fails: see also the authorities to which I referred in Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Limited [2006] FCA 647 at [27] , [36], [40], and [41].  10 The present proceedings are, of course, not an appeal from Cooper J. Nor is Health World estopped from asserting that the Health Plus mark was deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus trade mark at 7 May 2001, even though Cooper J found on the balance of probabilities that the Health Plus mark was not deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus mark as at that date: see Health World v Shin-Sun (per Cooper J) at [6], [41]; Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 647.
