<citances>
<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 234">The Respondent in this case, submits that none of the information before the Tribunal, fell within the meaning of information in s.424A. The Tribunal was not required to give the Applicant notice of matters of evidence and inconsistencies in evidence, which it was considering as part of its own appraisal of the case before it. [7] The Tribunal was entitled to have regard to the Applicant's claims and evidence given to the Tribunal, as previously constituted, [8] and the evidence given to the previous Tribunal was not subject to s.424A , because it was given by the Applicant for the purpose of his application for review. [9] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1798">15 The learned Federal Magistrate accepted the submissions of the Minister, and found that the Tribunal was entitled to have regard to the material provided to the first and second Tribunals. In other words, the invalidity of the first decision did not invalidate such material as had been presented at the earlier hearing of the Tribunal. Nor, in these circumstances, was there any obligation on the Tribunal to provide this adverse "information" from the first and second hearings to the appellant to give him the opportunity to comment on or respond to the information: see SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 per Emmett J at [16]-[17]; SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; and SZEPZ (supra)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1366">In making its adverse findings, the Tribunal, in part, relied upon evidence given by the Applicant at previous Tribunal hearings. There is no error in the Tribunal adopting such a course ( SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [17] ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1289">As relevantly observed by Emmett J in SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) FCA 190 at [16] - [17]: ... the primary judge considered the possibility that there may have been a contravention of s 424A of the Act by reason of the Tribunal having taken into account, in assessing the credibility of the applicant, the fact that the applicant failed to mention before the reconstituted Tribunal matters that he had mentioned to the earlier constituted Tribunal until he was reminded of them. His Honour concluded that there was no contravention of s 424A in adopting that course without giving written notice of information consistent of the evidence given by the applicant to the previously constituted Tribunal. Section 424A does not require such notice to be given in respect of information given by the applicant for the purposes of the application to the Tribunal. I accept these submissions by the first respondent. I consider that the present Tribunal was entitled to have regard to the material provided to the first and second Tribunals. Section 424(1) of the Act provides that in conducting the review, the Tribunal may get any information that it considers relevant. However, if the Tribunal gets such information, the Tribunal must have regard to that information in making the decision on the review. In this instance, the present Tribunal had regard to the tapes of the first Tribunal hearing and decided that in the first and second hearings, the applicant's evidence was "vague and unconvincing". The material before the Tribunal in the first hearing included the applicant's oral evidence and arguments. I accept the first respondent's submission in this regard that "the invalidity of that first decision does not invalidate such material presented at the earlier hearing of the Tribunal. [1] " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 824">As Emmett J stated in SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [17] : An invalid decision by the Tribunal is no decision at all. However, it does not follow that steps and procedures taken in arriving at that decision are themselves invalid or of no effect. The Tribunal still has before it the materials that were obtained when the decision that has been set aside was made. Specifically under s.422(2) where the Tribunal as reconstituted that Tribunal may have regard to any record of the proceedings of the review made by the Tribunal as previously constituted. In the present case, it may be said that the Tribunal had regard to the statements made by the applicant to the Tribunal as previously constituted. I do not consider that s.424A could be said to have been breached by an assessment on a part of the Tribunal of the credibility of the applicant based upon what he said at an earlier hearing of the Tribunal.  Insofar as the applicant's contention was that the information the Tribunal had obtained from the previously constituted Tribunal should not be regarded as information which he had given to the Tribunal and that such information must be put to him under s.424A(1) of the Migration Act , information provided to the Tribunal as originally constituted is information provided for the purposes of the review within s.424A(3)(b) of the Migration Act (see SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [17] ; SZITD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1343 at [22] and SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Another [2006] FCAFC 107 ; (2006) 159 FCR 291 at [39] ). The Tribunal as reconstituted was entitled to have regard to such evidence and the information or material provided to the first Tribunal whether in writing or orally at the first hearing (such as the applicant's claims about handing out flyers to strangers, his place of residence or his detention in March 2003). It was information which he provided to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review and is not subject to the obligation in s.424A(1) of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 786">I should just note further that to the extent that the currently constituted Tribunal relied on what was said to have been put before the previously constituted Tribunal at the hearing before it, that this evidence was information provided by the applicant to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review (see SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 at [39] , SZJBE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [19] , SZGYV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 1313 at [5] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 802">23 Further, the matters that formed a basis for the credibility findings were taken from his testimony before the Tribunal and were therefore excluded by reason of s 424A(3)(b): NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41] - [64]; SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [16] . In any event, there was no error in sending the s 424A letter after the hearing: SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 198 ; (2007) 164 FCR 578 at [34] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 694">It was not argued by the first respondent that these matters were not "information" within s 424A although that argument may well have been put. I express no opinion on that point. This claim can be decided on the ground that the matters I have identified fall within the exception in s 424A(3)(b) having regard to the authorities of this Court: SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 ; (2007) 159 FCR 291 at 299 [39] ; SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [16] - [17]. The other interpretation of the second ground of appeal is that the second Tribunal simply adopted the first Tribunal's decision without making its own decision on the appellant's application for review. That was a submission put by the appellant in the course of oral submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 656">28 Section 424A of the Act does not oblige the Tribunal to bring to the notice of an applicant, information which the applicant has given in evidence to a previously constituted Tribunal. That is information given by an applicant for the purpose of his or her application for review; see SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 , at [17]. The complaint invoking s 425 of the Act must be rejected for lack of evidence as already explained in relation to the appellant's contention that she was prevented by ill-health from effectively representing herself at the hearing before the Tribunal on 20 September 2006.  24 In relation to the appellant's second ground of appeal, the Minister contends that the learned Federal Magistrate did not err in his finding that there had been no contravention of s 424A(1) of the Act ; the Tribunal's rejection of the appellant's claim to be a Falun Gong practitioner was based on its appraisal of her claims made before the three separately constituted Tribunals, and that appraisal was not "information" for the purpose of s 424A(1) ; see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 , at [17]---[18]. The Minister contends that the material submitted and testimony given by the appellant to the three separate Tribunals was subject to the exception in s 424A(3)(b) of the Act , in that it was given by the appellant for the purpose of her application for review and therefore was not subject to s 424A(1) of the Act ; see SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 , at [39]; SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 , at [17].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 228">It was an attempt by the Tribunal to comply with what it perceived to be its procedural obligations under s.424A(1). As it turned out, it was not obliged to put the information referred to in the 424A letter to the applicant pursuant to s.424A(1) as the information in the applicant's application for protection visa did not in its own terms constitute rejection, denial or undermining of the applicant's claims and the appraisal of that information was not itself information: SZBYR at [17]-[25]. The remainder of the applicant's evidence was given by the applicant to the Tribunal for the purpose of his application for review, notwithstanding that it was given to previously constituted Tribunals, and was excepted from s.424A(1) by reason of s.424A(3): NBKT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (2006)156 FCR 419 at [41]-[64]; SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 at [39] ; SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [17] ; SZITD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1343 at [22] ; SZGYV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 1313 at [5]. The Tribunal was entitled to make reference to the evidence that the applicant had given to the Tribunal as twice previously constituted: SZJBE. To the extent that the reasoning in SZHLM is inconsistent with Full Federal Court authority in SZEPZ that reasoning is erroneous and the Court should apply the Full Federal Court authority of SZEPZ and the authorities of SZJBE, SZITD and SZGYV which have clearly applied SZEPZ or are consistent with the propositions accepted by the Court in SZEPZ. Mr Mitchell submits that the Tribunal considered the applicant's explanation for the various inconsistencies in his claims together with the evidence provided in the response to the s.424A letter (CB 165,167-170) but it was not satisfied with that explanation (CB 170). I agree that those findings were findings of fact, the fairness of which is not open to review by this Court: Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 at [35]-[36]. Nor was the Tribunal under any obligation to put its appraisals of the applicant's credit to him as appraisals based on inconsistencies in his evidence, or was not information of the nature covered by s.424A(1): SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18] - [25]. The information that formed the basis for the credibility finding was from the applicant's testimony and also does not fall within s.424A(1): NBKT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41] - [64] ; SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 at 39; SZJBE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [16] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 1948">8 On behalf of the First Respondent it was submitted that the Tribunal on the third occasion could properly have regard to the material which was before the earlier Tribunals as previously constituted. Reliance was placed upon the decision of Emmett J in SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [17] . Those submissions seem to be well-founded. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FMCA 1856">Ms McDonald further submits that the Tribunal sent the applicant two s.424A letters, one of which was sent by the previously constituted Tribunal. Further, the information relied upon by the Tribunal in its decision was information given by the applicant for the purposes of his application. The consisted of oral evidence and documents submitted to the Tribunal both at the first instance and on remittal. This information was either put to the applicant in the s.424A letters or falls within the exclusion in s.424A(3)(b) , as it was given by the applicant for the purpose of his application. The Tribunal on remittal is entitled to rely on what occurred before the Tribunal at first instance: SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 at [39] . In SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [16] , Emmett J applied the principles in SZEPZ which had almost identical facts. The Tribunal in SZJBE relied on inconsistencies in the applicant's evidence from the first to the second hearing. Ms McNamara submits that the applicant was properly invited to a hearing which he attended and gave oral evidence. Further there is no evidence of bias on the face of the Tribunal decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FCA 1313">5 The general statement about having regard to other information in the files does not found any breach of s 424A , which section is limited to particular types of information having a particular significance. Driver FM rejected the submission that the particular statement in the Tribunal's reasons was a breach, following the decision of Emmett J in SZJBE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 190 at [15] ---[17] in which it was held that s 424A does not require the Tribunal to disclose to an applicant information presented by the applicant to the Tribunal as previously constituted. No error has been shown in relation to that approach. Insofar as the submissions purported to go beyond these points as to s 424A , I do not have regard to them. I might say that, in any event, it is far from clear precisely what is suggested was caught by that section. Before passing from that ground, I should say that before the Federal Magistrates Court the particular of breach relied upon was use of the information derived from the first Tribunal decision and not the very general statement about the use of other information from the files. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCA 1343">22 However, in SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 , Emmett J addressed precisely the circumstances to which I have been referring. In that case, the Tribunal as reconstituted relied on inconsistencies with the then applicant's evidence from the first hearing at the second hearing before that reconstituted Tribunal. His Honour concluded at [16] --- [17] that doing so did not activate s 424A. That is a decision which is plainly directly on point. I should follow it unless I consider that it is plainly wrong. The applicant has not made a submission to me that it is plainly wrong, and I can readily understand the process of reasoning by which that conclusion was reached. In those circumstances I propose to follow that decision. As I regard that point as a significant and arguable one, I propose to give the applicant leave to appeal in respect of it but for the reasons which I have given I do not accept that the appeal should be allowed on that ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FCA 1218">14 In relation to the ground regarding s 424A , the Federal Magistrate noted that a letter which he regarded as having satisfied the requirements of that section had been sent to the appellant by the RRT on 24 January 2000. He concluded that the fact that the s 424A letter had been sent by the RRT at the time of the first hearing, rather than at the time of the second hearing, was of no consequence. He observed that the letter had been sent to the appellant as part of the process leading up to the RRT's earlier decision, which was subsequently set aside, but that this did not affect its significance.
