<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1517">The Respondents are to file a Defence to the Applicants' Amended Statement of Claim, together with any Cross Claim, on or before Wednesday 28 October 2009. "
 My reasons for making those orders are set out in Procter v Kalivis [2009] FCA 795. Those reasons for judgment also contain a description of the various allegations made by the applicants against the respondents (see [6]-[35]). As a result of the first order, the respondents were required to make discovery in the following terms: 
 
 "1. All documents in the possession, power or control of the Respondents recording or evidencing:
 1.1 instructions from each or any of the Respondents to the relevant financial institutions regarding any withdrawal of funds;
 1.2 the date on which the funds were withdrawn;
 1.3 the amount of funds withdrawn;
 1.4 the manner in which the funds were withdrawn (ie. by cash, cheque, telegraphic transfer and/or any other method); and
 1.5 how the funds withdrawn were applied and for what purpose(s),
 in relation to the following Bank facilities:
 1.6 Westpac Bank account number 43-4102 held in the name of Miss Eve Lynne Procter (defined as ' Lynne Procter's Westpac loan facility ' in sub-paragraph 41.2.1 of the Statement of Claim );

I will refer to this as the existing discovery order. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1099">It seems to me that the facts the plaintiffs will rely on to make out that allegation are, at best for the defendant, matters for particulars. The differences between material facts and particulars have been discussed in a number of cases. In the circumstances, I do no more than refer to my discussion of the differences in Procter v Kalivis [2009] FCA 795 at [44] - [46]. </sentence>
