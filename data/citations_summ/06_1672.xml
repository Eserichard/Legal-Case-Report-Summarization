<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 563">36 The cases to which I was referred in which security was ordered for a combination of past and future costs were cases where the hearing had not commenced: Brocklebank &amp; Co v The King's Lynn Steamship Co (1878) 3 CPD 365 ; Massey v Allen (1879) 12 ChD 807 ; JWH Turner &amp; Co Ltd v O'Riordan (1923) 40 WN (NSW) 64 ; Harvey v Jacob (1817) 106 ER 59 ; Bryan E Fencott and Associates Pty Ltd v Eretta Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [1987] FCA 102 ; (1987) 16 FCR 497.
