<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1075">10 The judgment that the appellant seeks to appeal was apparently made under O 13.03A of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules. Order 13.03A(c) permits the Court to dismiss an application if a party fails to appear at a hearing. The judgment is in the nature of an interlocutory judgment: see recently, for example, MZXMD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 769 at [7] per Weinberg J and the cases there cited. Accordingly, pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the appellant requires leave to appeal. The appellant has not sought leave, notwithstanding that the defect is apparent from the first respondent's notice of objection to competency. I note too that leave must be sought within 21 days of the pronouncement of the interlocutory decision or an extension of time sought in which to seek such leave. The appeal is incompetent in the absence of a grant of leave.</sentence>
