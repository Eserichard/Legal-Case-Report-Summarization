<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 197">It is the case that in SZIVK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 334 , Finkelstein J indicated that there was no justification for a Federal Magistrate to refuse to decide whether a migration agent had acted fraudulently on account of lack of notice to the migration agent, but that does not mean that the substantive merits should be considered on the assumption that Mr Q would not give evidence at a hearing. It is indisputable that what would be before the court are events that occurred some considerable time ago, from 1996 to 1998. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 983">As to the question of fraud, Mr Silva referred to the decision of Finkelstein J in SZIVK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [16] at [32]-[34]. He submitted that: It is not necessary for the applicant to demonstrate that the agent said anything false or to explain the reason for the agent's behaviour, such as that the agent did it for self-protection; Fraud can take many forms and it depends on the circumstances; and False information even given recklessly is sufficient. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 910">Finkelstein J pointed out in SZIVK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 334 at [33] that there are many ways in which fraud may be manifested. His Honour continued (at [33] --- [35]): In my opinion there can be little doubt that, if the appellant's claims be accepted, the migration agent was fraudulent in the relevant sense in his dealings with the appellant. The principal allegations are that his agent: falsely indicated in the response to hearing form that the appellant would attend the hearing when the agent knew that could not occur; and signed documents on the appellant's behalf without his knowledge, consent or authority and then forged his signature.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 559">(4) An agent who places his or her own interests above that of the client is not necessarily engaged in a fraud, even if the conduct in question breaches the requirements of the Migration Act and Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth); what is required is "'fraudulent' conduct vis-&agrave;-vis the appellant" having the effect of disabling or stultifying the processes of the Tribunal ( SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 170 FCR 211 ; [2008] FCA 600 at [48] ). (5) Where a person is "complicit and knowingly involved in the decision to mislead the Tribunal" ( SZHVM at [46]), it may hardly be said that the person is fraudulently deceived in the sense that occurred in SZFDE ( SZLHP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 172 FCR 170 ; [2008] FCAFC 152 at [20] ). (6) Nevertheless, "there are many ways in which fraud may be manifested" ( SZIVK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 334 at [33] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 324">He also referred the Court to the decisions in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIQB [21] at [24], SZIVK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [22] at [25]-[27], [32]-[34], and SZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [23] at [97], where the Full Court of the Federal Court (Moore, Marshall and Lander JJ) held: It should only be in exceptional circumstances that a Court should refuse to issue the constitutional writs once the Court has determined that the Tribunal has failed to comply with its imperative statutory obligations to an applicant seeking the review of a decision of the delegate refusing the applicant a protection visa. If it were otherwise, and the Court were required to inquire into the extent to which the failure by the Tribunal to comply with its statutory obligations to accord an applicant a fair hearing prejudiced the applicant, the imperative obligation imposed on the Tribunal might well be blunted. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 1239">Neither party cited any authority in relation to the issue of the necessity for notification to the third party in a case such as this. Such notification had taken place in SZFDE , although the agent in question did not ultimately give evidence before the Federal Magistrates Court. However in SZIVK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 334 Finkelstein J considered an allegation that a migration agent had provided false information and forged documents to the Tribunal on appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate who had refused to determine the allegation of fraud in circumstances where none of the documents in the proceedings had been served on the migration agent and the agent therefore had not appeared or made any submissions to the Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 1162">The distinction between administrative proceedings giving rise to obligations under procedural fairness for a person to be heard and judicial proceedings in a Chapter III Court, was recently referred to by Finkelstein J in SZIVK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 334 , in the same context in which I must decide the present application for representation. That is, where a migration agent has been identified in an allegation that a Tribunal's decision on a protection visa is invalid under the principles of SZFDE . At [22]-[25] his Honour said: [22] In the absence of a detailed explanation it is difficult to know what legal justification the Magistrate had in mind in declining to deal with the case raised by the appellant.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 1049">In light of the decision of Finkelstein J in SZIVK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 334 , the absence of notification of the person named as "Solicitor Chang" of the allegations that are made against him is not a reason for failing to proceed to consider the case raised by the applicant. In SZIVK at [18] --- [27] Finkelstein J considered a situation in which a Federal Magistrate had declined to deal with a claim of fraud of a migration agent where the migration agent had not been put on notice of the allegations made against him. Finkelstein J referred to the nature of adversarial proceedings before the Court and the need for the parties to define the issues to be contested, select the witnesses they intended to call and choose the evidence they wished to lead and observed that it was common for parties to make allegations which might involve criticising a third party who might not be called as a witness. His Honour found that there was no rule to the effect that the criticised person must be given notice that he was to be attacked in the evidence to be given. His Honour addressed the reasons for the absence of any such rule and concluded that there was no justification for the Federal Magistrate to refuse to decide whether the migration agent had acted fraudulently on account of a lack of notice to that person. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 584">The decision in Rejfek v McElroy [1965] HCA 46 ; (1965) 112 CLR 517 was relied on to establish that the appropriate standard of proof is "on the balance of probabilities" as stated in Briginshaw . The Court accepts that as the appropriate standard. The decision in SZIVK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 334 was referred to as a situation where signatures had been forged and where the failure of an applicant to attend the Tribunal hearing was allegedly a result of the fraudulent conduct of his migration agent. The dissenting judgment of Justice French in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142 ; (2006) 154 FCR 365 at 398---400 was referred to in paragraph 16 of SZIVK, being that "a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal was vitiated because the applicant was denied the opportunity to appear before the Tribunal due to the fraudulent conduct of his migration agent". In paragraph 20 of SZIVK Justice Finkelstein referred to the decision of the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 237 ALR 64 where it upheld Justice French's dissenting judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 600">51 It is also appropriate to mention at this point the recent decision of Finkelstein J in SZIVK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 334. In that case, his Honour was of the view, having considered the decision in SZFDE , that where a migration agent 'falsely indicated in the response to hearing form that the appellant would attend the hearing when the agent knew that could not occur' or where an agent 'signed documents on the appellant's behalf without his knowledge, consent or authority ... and forged [the appellant's] signature', then a court would likely find that there had been a fraud on the Tribunal. For the reasons already set out, SZIVK is distinguishable on the facts from those sought to be put to me on this appeal. 54 Whilst the appeal before me is not simply a case of a failure to inform or mere inadvertence, nor is it to be characterised as a case of fraud vis-&agrave;-vis the appellant, nor even then a fraud on the Tribunal. I appreciate, as Finkelstein J in SZIVK [2008] FCA 334 (at [33]) reminds us, that there are many ways in which fraud may be manifested. However, this is not a case where one can infer that the agent, in making the statements to the appellant that resulted in her not attending, acted other than honestly; Mr Marzukie was just concerned about his own interests and put them above those of the appellant.</sentence>
