<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 565">Those passages were said to show that Esso had paid fringe benefits tax referable to employees engaged on the Bass Strait project and the operation of s 44(h) of the Act had thereby been attracted. Similarly, it was said that audit costs related to the joint venture were not deductible because they had not been incurred in providing or carrying on the operations, facilities or other things comprising the Bass Strait project. Rather, they were analogous to the hedging costs considered by French J in Woodside Energy Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) (2007) 69 ATR 465 ; [2007] FCA 1961 , where his Honour observed, at 531 [276]; 
 
 In my opinion the requirement that expenditure contemplated by s 38 is liable to be made in carrying on or providing operations, facilities and other things comprising the project is incapable of covering the hedging expenses the subject of these proceedings. The section contemplates a close connection between the expenditure and the physical activities involved in the petroleum project. Interestingly, one of the cases cited on behalf of Woodside Energy, albeit for a different purpose, was Robe River Mining Co Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 21 FCR 1 in which the Full Federal Court said: 
 
 
 
 
 The use of the phrase "in carrying on prescribed mining operations" suggests a quite direct relationship between the expenditure and the operations, to be distinguished from the looser relationship which would be expressed by the words "in connection with" if they were used in a provision of this kind. 
 
 
 
 
 The passage was used to support the proposition that by not using, in s 24(b), language suggesting the kind of direct connection required in the provisions under discussion in Robe River Mining Co Pty Ltd 21 FCR 1 , Parliament had intended to provide for a wide range of relationships between expenses and sales for the purposes of s 24(b). As indicated above, for reasons which I have given, I do not accept that proposition. And it is plain that so far as s 38 is concerned it cannot extend to expenses of the kind in issue in this case.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 360">Further, where legislation, as in this case, is based upon concepts related to economic theory and a change in approach to taxation, care needs to be taken in the application of that theory and comments made by various interested parties. As French J (as he then was) stated in Woodside Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2007] FCA 1961 ; (2007) 69 ATR 465 at [203] : 
 
 An assumption that legislation which uses economic terms or concepts related to a particular economic theory or model, thereby applies the theory or model, whether it be for the purpose of regulation or tax collection, is an assumption which requires close scrutiny. Particular statutes may be based upon or inspired by economic theories or models. Their precise terms, however, may reflect policy choices or political compromises inconsistent with a complete acceptance or application of the theory or model concerned. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] WASCA 57">97 The expression 'related to' is one of the expressions commonly used in statutes to identify a connection between two matters. The expression is capable of operating broadly (see for example, Kennon v Spry [2008] HCA 56 ; (2008) 238 CLR 366 [217]), but the nature of the connection required between the two matters will necessarily depend upon the context in which the expression appears - see Workers Compensation Board of Queensland v Technical Products Pty Ltd [1988] HCA 49 ; (1988) 165 CLR 642 , 653 - 654. Accordingly, the citation of authority on the meaning to be given to the expression will be of limited assistance unless the authority relates to similar or analogous statutory settings - see Woodside Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2007] FCA 1961 ; (2007) 69 ATR 465 [270]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] ATODTR TR2010/D4">2 ) [2007] FCA 1961 (the Woodside case) French J of the Federal Court stated at paragraph 276 of the judgment: In my opinion the requirement that expenditure contemplated by s 38 is liable to be made in carrying on or providing operations, facilities and other things comprising the project is incapable of covering the hedging losses the subject of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] TASSC 92">
 11 For the conduct that resulted in the finding that Mr Boland was unable to efficiently and effectively perform the duties assigned to him to be reviewable under s50(1), it must be a State Service action. As to whether a review of that action is prohibited by s50(3) because it is an action "in respect of" the termination of Mr Boland's employment, counsel cited a number of authorities on the meaning of that conjunctive phrase.
