<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] VSC 330">8 In Watson v AWB Limited, [2] before Foster J in the Federal Court of Australia, the applicants had obtained leave to issue a subpoena to ASIC relating to statements and transcripts in relation to former employees and lawyers of AWB (the relevant individuals). At hearings before Foster J, the applicants and AWB foreshadowed and put forward variations of a proposed procedure whereby AWB would be permitted an exclusive first right to inspect the statements and transcripts produced by ASIC in relation to the relevant individuals, in order to assert and if necessary have determined by the Court any claims AWB may have in respect of LPP. Counsel for ASIC appeared at the hearings and raised no objection to the proposed procedure. Foster J has not yet ruled on the procedure to be adopted, because a number of interested individuals have made submissions opposing the inspection by the applicants of the documents produced by ASIC, and this question has not yet been determined.</sentence>
