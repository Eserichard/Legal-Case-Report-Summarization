<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWSC 1350">75 For reasons already discussed, Company X no longer holds a debt owed by Company Y. No question of compromise of a debt therefore arises, with the result that there is no occasion for an approving order to be made under s 477(2A). The section is concerned with debts strictly so called: see, for example, Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 7) [2006] FCA 1177 ; Elderslie Finance Corporation Ltd v Newpage Pty Ltd (No 6) [2007] FCA 1030 ; (2007) 160 FCR 423. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1030">20 As Barrett J observed in HIH Insurance Ltd and Related Matters [2004] NSWSC 5 ( HIH ) at [12], it appears that in some cases a strict approach has not been taken to the jurisdictional question posed by the expression "a debt to the company". In some cases, Judges have granted approval under s 477(2A) without discussion of the jurisdictional question. It can be just as important to decide that a compromised claim is not one of a debt to the company as to decide that it is. In Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 7) [2006] FCA 1177 , for example, a challenge was made to a compromise entered into by a liquidator on the ground that approval under s 477(2A) had not been obtained, and Kenny J had no hesitation in holding that the submission failed because it was "based on a misunderstanding as to what constitutes a 'debt' under the relevant section" (at [143]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 85">56 The Commission refers to the decision of Kenny J in Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 7) [2006] FCA 1177 at [166] which recently considered the general principles for determining whether an action may be done other than in good faith. Kenny J emphasised that an allegation of bad faith is a ' serious allegation involving the imputation of moral turpitude '. At [168], Her Honour said:
 
 '...The focus of an inquiry concerning an allegation of bad faith is the state of mind of the decision-maker. The Court is not simply evaluating the wisdom of an impugned decision... "mere error or irrationality does not of itself demonstrate lack of good faith...[b]ad faith is not to be found simply because of poor decision-making": SBBS at 756 [45] . Rather the circumstances must show dishonesty (or capriciousness) on the part of the decision-maker... Something is done in "good faith" when done honestly. Something is done in "bad faith" when done dishonestly. ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 1537">1 On 12 September 2006, the Court refused the applicant's motion and otherwise dismissed the proceeding, which sought to set aside a settlement entered into by the respondents. When the Court delivered its reasons for judgment, it gave the parties an opportunity to make written submissions on costs: see Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 7) [2006] FCA 1177. </sentence>
