<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 863">However, an employer may repudiate an employment contract in ways other than by express termination of employment, such as by a unilateral demotion of the employee: Visscher v Giudice ; Woolworths (SA) Pty Ltd v Russian (1996) 66 IR 13. The question is whether the conduct of the employer, judged objectively, evinced an intention to no longer be bound by the contract or to fulfil it only in a manner substantially inconsistent with its obligations: Whittaker v Unisys Australia Pty Ltd (2010) 192 IR 311 at 318-319 [32]-[33]. In those cases the employee may or may not elect to accept the repudiation. If the employee accepts the repudiation, that brings the contract and the employment relationship to an end. In such cases the employer's repudiation will be treated as a dismissal, although a constructive one: Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 939 ; (2002) 116 IR 186 ; Russell v The Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney (2008) 72 NSWLR 559 at 567 [33] per Basten JA; Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corporation Ltd [2007] FCAFC 35 ; (2007) 248 ALR 353 ; Hem v Cant [2007] FCA 81 ; (2007) 159 IR 113. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] WASC 290">It makes little sense, for instance, that the implied obligation to act fairly should apply when an employer is considering whether to suspend an employee but not when the employer is proposing to take the more drastic step of dismissing him. ' 
 
 
 Recognising that an employer may act with reasonable and proper cause to pursue its own interests, whether or not they are adverse to those of the employee, and may terminate the employment at any time without cause on giving notice, casts some uncertainty on the scope and extent of the implied duties. In Australia, they have enjoyed more limited recognition than in the UK and have usually been called in aid to identify the kind of conduct of an employer sufficient to constitute 'constructive dismissal', which the employee can treat as a repudiation of the contract of employment: see Easling v Mahoney Insurance Brokers [2001] SASC 22 ; 78 SASR 489 at [99] (Olsson J); Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 939 ; (2002) EOC 93-227 ; (2002) 116 IR 186 at [141] (Allsop J); Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corporation Ltd [2007] FCAFC 35 ; (2007) 248 ALR 353 (Moore , Tamberlin and Gyles JJ); Hem v Cant [2007] FCA 81 ; (2007) 159 IR 113 at [20] - [23] (Finkelstein J); Delooze v Healey [2007] WASCA 157 at [32] (Wheeler JA, Steytler P agreeing). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 800">In an action where Ms Hobson seeks damages for breach of contract in relation to the termination of her employment by INVision Investigations, in addition to statutory remedies under the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth), [15] there can be no doubt that she has a duty to mitigate her loss. [16] In order for the Court to assess Ms Hobson's alleged loss, the Court would at least need to know: whether Ms Hobson endeavoured to obtain work subsequent to termination of her employment with INVision Investigations; whether, if Ms Hobson worked, she worked as an employee, an independent contractor, a partner, or in some other form of work, because, if the taxation treatment of the forms of work is different, it might alter the quantum of her alleged loss; [17] and if Ms Hobson worked, for how long she worked, and how much she earned, or was entitled to receive and did actually receive.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] SASC 272">The Full Court [173] provided a helpful survey of the current position of the implied term in Australia. Their Honours set out the decisions in which Australian Courts have suggested that such a term exists [174] and those which have not. [175] Their Honours also indicated that the High Court appears to have endorsed the concept on a few occasions. Specifically, the Full Court reproduced a quote from Koehler v Cerebros (Australia) Limited , [176] where the majority (McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ) said, in the context of a suit in negligence, that: [177] 
 
 it is only when the contractual position between the parties (including the implied duty of trust and confidence between them) 'is explored fully along with the relevant statutory framework' that it would be possible to give appropriate content to the duty of reasonable care upon which an employee claiming damages for negligent infliction of psychiatric injury at work would seek to rely.

 Introduction 
 This is an appeal against an award of damages to a former teacher for breach of his employment contract.  The implication of a term of mutual trust and confidence has been either endorsed or acknowledged in a number of decisions; Carrigan v Darwin City Council [37] (von Doussa J), Daw v Flinton Pty Ltd [38] (von Doussa J), Easling v Mahoney Insurance Brokers [39] (Olsson J but in dissent), Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd [40] (Allsop J), Morris v Hanley [41] (Hamilton J), Hem, Re Coulco Trading Pty Ltd v Cant [42] (Finkelstein J), Taske v Occupational and Medical Innovations Ltd [43] (Moynihan J), Morton v Transport Appeal Board (No. 1) [44] (Berman AJ), Delooze v Healey [45] (Steytler P, Wheeler JA), Downe v Sydney West Area Health Service (No. 2) [46] (Rothman J) and Quinn v Gray [47] (Byrne J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 1568">It makes little sense, for instance, that the implied obligation to act fairly should apply when an employer is considering whether to suspend an employee but not when the employer is proposing to take the more drastic step of dismissing him. "" 
before saying at [33]:
 
 "Recognising that an employer may act with reasonable and proper cause to pursue its own interests, whether or not they are adverse to those of the employee, and may terminate the employment at any time without cause on giving notice, casts some uncertainty on the scope and extent of the implied duties. In Australia, they have enjoyed more limited recognition than in the UK and have usually been called in aid to identify the kind of conduct of an employer sufficient to constitute "constructive dismissal", which the employee can treat as a repudiation of the contract of employment: see Easling v Mahoney Insurance Brokers [2001] SASC 22 ; [2001] SASC 22 ; 78 SASR 489 at [99] (Olsson J); Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 939 ; (2002) EOC 93 ---227; 116 IR 186 at [141] (Allsop J); Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corporation Ltd [2007] FCAFC 35 (Moore, Tamberlin and Gyles JJ); Hem, Re Coulco Trading Pty Ltd v Cant [2007] FCA 81 ; 159 IR 113 at [20]---[23] (Finkelstein J); Delooze v Healey [2007] WASCA 157 at [32] (Wheeler JA, Steytler P agreeing). In Hem , on facts not so distant from the present case, the employee was accused by his superior of being a thief, without justification. The Court accepted that such conduct could constitute constructive dismissal because it constituted conduct inconsistent with the mutual trust required for the employment relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] VSC 491">The duty is not unduly onerous and does not require Mr Howard to be successful. He must act reasonably. [18] 
145 Mr Howard gave evidence of the steps taken by him to find alternate employment. His evidence was not challenged. I find that he acted reasonably in that regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] NSWSC 1178">39 The next step is to determine what was reasonable notice in the circumstances of this case. The plaintiff relied upon a number of cases in support of the submission that a reasonable period of notice in the circumstances of this case would be in the range of 6 to 12 months: Savage v British India Steam Navigation Co (1930) 46 TLR 294 ; Quinn v Jack Chia (Australia) Ltd [1992] VicRp 37 ; [1992] 1 VR 567 ; Rankin v Marine Power International Pty Ltd [2001] VSC 150 ; (2001) 107 IR 117 ; Dyer v Peverill (1979) 2 NTR 1 ; Caulfield v Broken Hill City Council (1995) 60 IR 221 ; and Hem v Cant [2007] FCA 81 ; (2007) 159 IR 113. Although some of these cases have some similarities to the facts of this case, the question of what is reasonable notice will depend upon the facts of the particular case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 549">1 At one point I was minded to require the administrator to pay all the plaintiff's costs on a solicitor and client basis. See my reasons in Hem, in the matter of Coulco Trading Pty Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) v Cant (Administrator of the Deed of Company Arrangement of Coulco Trading Pty Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) [2007] FCA 81. Having reflected on the matter further and having considered the submissions by the administrator's counsel I am satisfied that my original view was incorrect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCAFC 35">The finding of discharge by agreement needs to be understood in the light of the further finding of the primary Judge that Brand had no practical alternative but to accept Elliott's decision to remove him from providing services as Managing Director --- the only position provided for by the Agreement. That would be akin to constructive dismissal if the contract were a contract of service albeit by the major shareholder ( Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 116 IR 186 ; [2002] FCA 939 ; Hem, in the matter of Coulco Trading Pty Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) v Cant (Administrator of the Deed of Company Arrangement of Coulco Trading Pty Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement)) [2007] FCA 81 at [20] ---[23]). The fact that Brand accepted the removal rather than resign and litigate does not change the true nature of what occurred. It was comfortably within the concept of termination of the Agreement. Brand's later provision of other services to Energy World is beside the point. </sentence>
