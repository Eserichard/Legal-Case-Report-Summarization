<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 200">In Rivera v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCA 1 Tamberlin J emphasised the words '... may , if it is in the interests of the administration of justice ...'. At [7]-[8] his Honour stated: The issue in the present reasons is whether the discretion of the Court should determine that the "administration of justice" requires Mr Rivera's proceedings to be referred to the Registrar to arrange for pro bono legal representation. In my view, the administration of justice in this case does not require that the matter be referred to a Registrar to arrange pro bono legal representation or advice for Mr Rivera because his application of 28 December 2007 discloses no reasonable prospects of success, and Mr Rivera has not adduced any evidence or provided any authority to indicate otherwise. The lack of reasonable prospects of success, or where a case is "patently hopeless" or has no "arguable basis", has been regarded by the Court as sufficient reason to refuse a referral under O 80 r 4: see Taylor [2005] FCA 319 at [10] ; Rivera v The Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1465 at [34] . As a matter of discretion, therefore, I am of the view that it is not appropriate to prolong the present proceedings which are without merit. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 63">That does not mean that if legal representation is unavailable the litigation must come to a halt. It may be that, if in the end, no pro bono practitioner is found who is willing to act then the appellant would have to represent himself. 

 A referral has been refused where it has been concluded that proceedings disclose no arguable basis or disclose no reasonable prospects of success: see, eg, Ri v era v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1465 ; Rivera v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCA 1. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1">8 In my view, the administration of justice in this case does not require that the matter be referred to a Registrar to arrange pro bono legal representation or advice for Mr Rivera because his application of 28 December 2007 discloses no reasonable prospects of success, and Mr Rivera has not adduced any evidence or provided any authority to indicate otherwise. The lack of reasonable prospects of success, or where a case is "patently hopeless" or has no "arguable basis", has been regarded by the Court as sufficient reason to refuse a referral under O 80 r 4: see Taylor [2005] FCA 319 at [10] ; Rivera v The Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1465 at [34] .
