<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1223">In Underdown v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCA 965 ( Underdown No 1 ), I concluded (at [64]) that the appeal was incompetent and had no prospects of success. I made the following additional observations (at [65] and [66]): These reasons do not develop at length the underlying very sad circumstances in which the complete breakdown in communications between Mr Fazio (now) and Centrelink have developed. However unfortunate that may be, there is no power in the Court to entertain this appeal but, in any event, no useful purpose would be served by allowing an inevitably doomed appeal to continue to run. To do so would not be in the interests of the respondent, of Mr Fazio, of the public or the Court. The appeal must be dismissed. Costs would follow the event in the ordinary course. I will allow Mr Fazio 10 days from the date of delivery of the reasons file any written submissions as to why costs should not follow the event. The Secretary is to file written submissions, if any, in response within a further 7 days. </sentence>
