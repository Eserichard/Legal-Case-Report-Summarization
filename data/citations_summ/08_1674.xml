<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 811">The applicant first sought review of that Tribunal decision by application filed in this Court on 28 December 2007. That application was dismissed by Raphael FM on 30 June 2008 after consideration of the grounds raised by the applicant (see SZLVG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 960). The applicant unsuccessfully appealed to the Federal Court. The appeal was dismissed on 8 December 2008 (see SZLVG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1674). Jagot J considered the grounds of appeal and also another possible basis for jurisdictional error. The applicant then lodged an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court. That was also unsuccessful (see SZLVG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Amor [2009] HCASL 127). Heydon and Bell JJ saw no basis for doubting the correctness of the Federal Court's conclusion that the Tribunal did not misapprehend the principles explained in SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] HCA 40 ; (2007) 233 CLR 18 in dealing with the question of relocation or that the decision of the Tribunal was not affected by jurisdictional error in the other respects that were the subject of challenge. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 578">The final proposed Ground of Appeal is understood to be referring to SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 40 , 233 CLR 18. It was there concluded that a well-founded fear of persecution need not always extend to the whole territory of an applicant's country of nationality for the applicant to qualify as a refugee. It was further concluded that a person will be excluded from refugee status if, under all of the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to seek refuge in another part of the same country. Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ there concluded: 
 [24] ... What is reasonable, in the sense of 'practicable', must depend upon the particular circumstances of the applicant for refugee status and the impact upon that person of relocation of the place of residence within the country of nationality. ...
 [26] ... [I]n particular cases territorial distinctions may have an apparent connection with the particular reason for the asserted well-founded fear of persecution. There may be instances where differential treatment in matters of, for example, race or religion, is encountered in various parts of the one nation state so that in some parts there is insufficient basis for a well-founded fear of persecution. However, in other cases the conduct or attribute of the individual which attracts the apprehended persecution may be insusceptible of a differential assessment based upon matters of regional geography.
