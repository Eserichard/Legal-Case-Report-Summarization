The latter authority has also been discussed more recently in Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 117 , where a Full Court of this Court refined the views expressed in Jefferson Ford and emphasised that the power reposed in this Court by s 31A is discretionary, and is to be exercised with an eye to all of the circumstances of the case.

As Lander J said in the judgment, the subject of the present appeal, at paragraph 49: 
 
 
 Section 31A of the Federal Court Act was enacted by the legislature with full knowledge of the decisions of the High Court in relation to the summary dismissal of proceedings and, in particular, the decision of the High Court in Dey [1949] HCA 1 ; 78 CLR 62 at 91 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. It may be thought, in those circumstances, that the purpose of the enactment of s 31A was to relax the rigours of the test imposed by the High Court in General Steel Industries [1964] HCA 69 ; 112 CLR 125 as to the necessary circumstances in which a proceeding may be struck out summarily: Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 ; (2006) 65 ATR 222 and White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 1374">Obviously, there will be cases in which, because of their nature, it is necessary to undergo detailed analysis. However, the assessment of whether there is a reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding must depend upon the evidence and pleading the subject of the application. In Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 at [26] - [29] (decided on 5 December 2006) Mansfield J appeared to support the more liberal approach taken by Wilcox J, although the case was essentially decided on the basis of Anshun estoppel [5] . Further support for the approach taken by Wilcox J can be found in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227 (decided on 15 September 2006) at [9]-[11] per Moore J and Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 (decided 28 April 2006) at [6] per Heerey J.

 Section 31A of the Federal Court Act was enacted by the legislature with full knowledge of the decisions of the High Court in relation to the summary dismissal of proceedings and, in particular, the decision of the High Court in Dey [1949] HCA 1 ; 78 CLR 62 at 91 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125.

So much is supported by the Attorney-General's second reading speech on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 (Cth) which was the legislative vehicle which introduced s 31A. He said:

 The bill also strengthens the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters, by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases. It is appropriate that this provision is of general application. It will be a useful addition to the courts' powers in dealing with any unsustainable case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 60">109 The present case bears some similarity to the facts in Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 ; (2006) 65 ATR 222 ('Jewiss'). In that case Mansfield J had before him a motion seeking relief under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and Order 20 rule 2 and Order 16 rule 11 of the Federal Court Rules in a taxation appeal against certain appealable objection decisions. His Honour held that it would be an abuse of the Court's process to permit Mr Jewiss to re-litigate in the proceedings before him the same matters as had previously been determined against him in the South Australian District Court. His Honour considered that, because the issues which Mr Jewiss sought to raise before him were 'the same issues as those he sought to raise in the District Court proceedings and upon which an adjudication adverse to those claims' had been made, there was no scope for the principle of 'Anshun' estoppel to be applied. His Honour said at [51]:
 
 'It is not a matter of him raising matters now which he did not, but could have, raised in the earlier proceedings. ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FCA 1257">8 The issue then, is what should be done in respect of the application. As I have said, this is the third occasion upon which this matter has been listed for hearing. It was first listed for hearing, commencing on 24 July 2006. That hearing was abandoned because the applicant wished to extend the nature of his allegations in a way which subsequently I found to be improper. His proposed allegations were dismissed, except for the present claim under Pt IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth), by judgment delivered on 5 December 2006 in Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FMCA 1360">The question of the precise meaning of s.31A of the FCA Act and s.17A of the FM Act and of any change they have made has already been the subject of numerous decisions in this Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. The most recent review of them of which I am aware is that of Driver FM on 19 March 2007 in Vivid Entertainment LLC v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 157 at [18] - [28]. The authorities to which his Honour referred are: Howard v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2006] FMCA 975 ; MG Distribution Pty Ltd v Khan [2006] FMCA 666 ; Cate v International Flavours and Fragrances (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 36 ; Vans Inc v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 ; Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 ; Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 ; Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227 ; Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; (2006) 150 IR 471 ; Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 1441 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 ; Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 ; Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299. Not one of these cases was a migration case. In other words, the task of exploring the meaning of s.31A has arisen in a wide range of the cases in the Federal Magistrates Court and this Court, with the striking exception of migration cases, no doubt for the reason that I mentioned earlier: the provision is of no practical importance in them.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FCA 923">4 Section 31A of the Act relaxes the test in relation to which a proceeding may be struck out or summarily dismissed from the test set out in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (New South Wales) [1964] HCA 69 ; 1964 112 CLR 125. See also Jewiss v DCT [2006] FCA 1688 at 26 per Mansfield J and Lawrenson Light Metal Die Casting Pty Ltd (in liq) v Cosmick Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 753 at [15] per Heerey J. The former test as Heerey J said required that the allegations be quite clearly so untenable that they cannot possibly succeed. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs16" from="[2007] FCA 511">Third, while s 31A of the FCA Act (mutatis mutandis, s 17A of the FM Act) achieves nothing of significance in relation to migration cases, it is of general application and therefore affects all proceedings brought in the Court.

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2007] FCA 489">9 The extent to which s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act relaxes the test formulated in General Steel has been the subject of observations in recent decisions of this Court: Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; Garrett v Macks [2006] FCA 601 per Lander J at [21]-[22]; Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 per Mansfield J at [26]-[29]; Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 per Tamberlin J at [12].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2007] FMCA 157">In Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 at [26] - [29] (decided on 5 December 2006) Mansfield J appeared to support the more liberal approach taken by Wilcox J, although the case was essentially decided on the basis of Anshun estoppel [5] .</sentence>
