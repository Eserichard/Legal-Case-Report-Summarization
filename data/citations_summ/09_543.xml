<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 838">Having made those findings, the need for the Tribunal to identify the particular social group of which the applicant claimed to be a member was rendered otiose. [5] While it might be contended that the Tribunal did not consider the particular social group and adopt the two step approach as provided for in Dranichnikov [6] , it is not to the point to say that the Tribunal should have followed these steps. As his Honour Justice Finkelstein stated in MZXDQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [7] : "The Appellant contended before this Court that this was an impermissible line of reasoning. He argued that the steps outlined in Dranichnikov must be followed even if the Tribunal is of the view that the Applicant's fear is unrelated to the membership of any such group.</sentence>
