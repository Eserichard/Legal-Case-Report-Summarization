Reliance is placed on Inspector Cruse v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1267 ; (2008) 175 IR 447 (the substantive proceeding) and Cruse v CFMEU (No 2) [2008] FCA 1637 (the penalty proceeding) as an example of contraventions of ss 298SC and 170NC of the Act by the CFMEU. The Union was vicariously liable for the conduct of its delegate, Mr Fry. The conduct involved Mr Fry falsely telling a self-employed building contractor engaged to do work on a building site that he was required to join the CFMEU (the s 298SC breach) and falsely telling the contractor that he was required to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement (the s 170NC breach). </sentence>
