<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 27">The next contention raised by the Applicant centres on her allegations concerning the conduct of her former migration agent and a bank manager in India. By these allegations, the Applicant seems to be attempting to bring her case within that considered in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 232 CLR 189. It is accepted that a fraud practiced on the Tribunal by a person, other than the visa Applicant, may disable the Tribunal from the due discharge of its statutory functions with respect to the conduct of the review. However, strong evidence in required to establish that fraud. Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362 per Dixon J requires that fraud must be proved "clearly", "unequivocally", "strictly" or "certainly". Further, the fraud must be shown to affect the process proscribed by the Act; in particular, whether the Applicant had the opportunity to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments (see SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 at [34] per Besanko J; SZLHP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1675 at [16] per Scarlett FM. For a more recent discussion of the issued raised and considered in respect of an alleged fraud on the Tribunal see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Lu [2010] FCAFC 147). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] HCASL 258">The applicant commenced proceedings seeking judicial review of the Tribunal's determination in the Federal Magistrates Court on 20 January 2005. There were delays, to which it is not necessary to refer, associated with the progress of the application. In May 2006, the applicant swore an affidavit in support of his Amended Application in which he made allegations concerning the conduct of a Mr Lu who he said had acted as his migration agent. The Amended Application came on for hearing before Cameron FM on 20 October 2006. His Honour delivered a reserved judgment dismissing the application [2] . An appeal to the Federal Court (Besanko J) was successful and the proceeding was remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for re-hearing [3] .
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 562">Federal Magistrate Cameron subsequently delivered a reserved judgment wherein he dismissed the initial judicial review application: SZFNX v Minister For Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 47. A subsequent appeal to the Federal Court was heard by Besanko J who upheld the appeal: SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980. The matter was then remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for rehearing.  Before Besanko J, however, in SZFNX [2007] FCA 1980 , which judgment was delivered on 13 December 2007, his Honour noted at [32] that the effect in SZFDE High Court was that, if an agent is fraudulent in his or her dealings with an applicant for review which results in the applicant not being heard by the RRT, then the RRT's decision may be void, the RRT's jurisdiction being "constructively unexercised". His Honour also considered that while it was not entirely clear, it would not be enough for it to be shown that an agent had acted "negligently or incorrectly". The agent must be shown to have acted fraudulently: see [33]. Accordingly, the giving of bad or negligent advice would be insufficient to make out the jurisdictional error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 380">There must also be a causative relationship between the fraud and the stultification or frustration of the legislative scheme governing the Tribunal's procedures. In Jalagam v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 197 it was alleged that a migration agent's failure to communicate a delegate's decision speedily amounted to fraud. As Edmonds J stated (at [42]): Plainly, SZFDE required not only that there be fraud in the sense of dishonesty, but also that there be a causative connection between that and the Tribunal being 'disabled ... from the true discharge of its imperative statutory functions with respect to the conduct of the review': SZFDE at [51]; such that its decision was, in law, no decision at all: (SZLIX at [18]; also [20]). If the appellant would in any event have been out of time, any dishonesty (assuming, contrary to his Honour's finding, that there was some dishonesty by anyone at Tan &amp; Tan) would not have made any difference. There would be no link between the suggested 'fraud' and the Tribunal's decision-making process: SZFNX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 at [32] and [34] also speaks of this requirement. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 1159">It was the latter issue which was addressed and determined in this Court in SZNFX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor . [17] As noted in SZNFX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor , [18] no findings were made in SZFNX (No. 1) as to whether Mr Lu, a migration agent, "had been fraudulent in his dealings with the appellant [applicant] and whether that had affected the process prescribed in the [ Migration ] Act . " [19] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 983">Fraud is not to be found simply on the basis of what should properly be characterised as bad or even negligent advice or conduct (see SZHBC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship at [17]-[18]; SZHZT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [35] at [3], [11] and [12]; SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [36] at [31]-[33]; SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [37] at [43]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 944">I was helpfully provided with a bundle of the decisions which I have marked as Exhibit 1. An analysis of these reveals the following. The first case is SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 , which was a case where the applicant complained that Mr Lu had not told him to go to a hearing. Importantly, the Federal Court decision of Besanko J notes the following: "The Federal Magistrate did not make any findings as to whether Mr Lu had been fraudulent in his dealings with the appellant and whether that had affected the process prescribed in the Act..." [36] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 667">As set out above, in his review application the applicant alleged fraud on the part of his former migration agent. He did not elaborate on these claims in oral submissions. Counsel for the first respondent submitted that although the applicant contended that he did not receive the second Tribunal decision or other correspondence from the Tribunal by reason of his migration agent's fraudulent conduct, no such conduct was alleged in respect of the period after 6 September 2006 and that none of the matters alleged by the applicant disclosed fraud on the part of the migration agent prior to this time (see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLIX and Another [2008] FCAFC 17 ; (2008) 245 ALR 501). It was contended that taken at its highest the applicant's evidence may disclose oversight and/or negligence on the part of his migration agent, but that such conduct did not amount to fraud (see SZFDE and Others v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 232 CLR 189 at [53] and SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 at [33] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 542">In SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 , Besanko J said at [34]: the fraud must affect the process prescribed by the Act, in particular, whether the applicant has had the opportunity to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.  In SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 , Besanko J said at [34]: the fraud must affect the process prescribed by the Act, in particular, whether the applicant has had the opportunity to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 324">It was further submitted that, to establish fraud, the conduct of the third party must be more than simple failure to inform or bare negligence or inadvertence ( SZLIX at [33]; SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [25] at [33]; SZKAI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [26] at [32]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FCA 197">Plainly, SZFDE required not only that there be fraud in the sense of dishonesty, but also that there be a causative connection between that and the Tribunal being 'disabled ... from the true discharge of its imperative statutory functions with respect to the conduct of the review': SZFDE at [51]; such that its decision was, in law, no decision at all: ( SZLIX at [18]; also [20]). If the appellant would in any event have been out of time, any dishonesty (assuming, contrary to his Honour's finding, that there was some dishonesty by anyone at Tan &amp; Tan) would not have made any difference. There would be no link between the suggested 'fraud' and the Tribunal's decision-making process: SZFNX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 at [32] and [34] also speaks of this requirement. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 1864">16 In SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 , Besanko J considered fraud by an agent in the context of a Tribunal hearing. In that case, the appellant's signature had been falsely placed on the document and part of the appellant's statement had been made up. Justice Besanko said at [37] that those facts may go some way towards establishing fraud but that it is still necessary for the appellant to show that the fraud has affected the process described by the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). In this case, the matters raised by the appellant, namely:
 
&#8226; the fact that Mr Shi signed the form in the context of an authority to act;
 
&#8226; the fact that the appellant had not notified Mr Shi of his new address; and
 
&#8226; the fact that Mr Shi failed to tell the appellant about the Tribunal hearing;
 
do not constitute fraud on the Tribunal within the meaning of SZFDE and there is not sufficient evidence to support such a conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 1239">As the High Court stated in SZFDE at [53] by reference to what was said by French J in the Full Court of the Federal Court: " there are sound reasons of policy why a person whose conduct before an administrative Tribunal has been affected, to the detriment of that person, by bad or negligent advice or some other mishap should not be heard to complain that the detriment vitiates the decision made. The outcome in the present appeal stands apart from and above such considerations ". I note that Besanko J suggested in SZFNX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 at [33] that " an applicant's failure to appear before the Tribunal by reason of the bad or negligent advice of his or her agent, as distinct from fraudulent advice or conduct, is not without more sufficient to constitute jurisdictional error " (and see SZLIX at [33]). On this basis the third party must be shown to have acted " fraudulently . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 1056">Ms Mitchelmore also submitted that even if the Court were to accept that there had been omission on the part of the agent in advising the Applicant of the hearing, there was no substratum of facts that would justify the inference that the agent dishonestly omitted to give that Applicant that information (see Minister for immigration and Citizenship v SZLIX [18] ). In order to constitute a fraud on the Tribunal, it is not enough for the agent to act negligently or incorrectly; he or she must act fraudulently (see SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [19] ).  SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 237 ALR 64 ; 81 ALJR 1401 ; [2007] HCA 35 followed. Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLIX [2008] FCAFC 17 cited. SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 cited. Al-Mehdawi v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1990] 1 AC 876 cited. Hot Holdings Pty Ltd v Creasy [2002] HCA 15 ; (2002) 210 CLR 438 cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FMCA 1049">The applicant's statements also raised the possibility that she was seeking to take issue with the conduct of the person she claimed had assisted her in connection with her application for a protection visa, although such a claim was not raised very clearly. When given the opportunity to expand in oral evidence on the circumstances in which she failed to attend the Tribunal hearing the applicant did not elaborate on this issue. Nonetheless, in light of the principles considered by Besanko J in SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 , it is appropriate to consider whether the applicant sought to raise, and if so whether she has established a case of third party fraud as considered by the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1401. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FCA 600">43 I do not consider that Mr Marzukie was motivated to hide anything from the Tribunal. The conflict of interest suggested between looking after the appellant's interests and his own personal needs, even if in breach of the Code of Conduct prescribed by the Migration Agents Regulations 1998 , has not been shown to be a matter Mr Marzukie would have been concerned about, or would have motivated his conduct. The real reason not to have the appellant attend the hearing was just the fact that Mr Marzukie wanted his child looked after by the appellant. Mr Marzukie may have put his interests above the appellant's but that could not amount to a finding of fraud. He described the 'interview' as 'important', but asserted that work was 'more important', which is more properly to be characterised as 'bad' advice: SZFDE [2007] HCA 35 ; 237 ALR 64 at [53] ; see also SZHBC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1310 at [17] - [18] per Spender J; SZHZT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1661 at [3] , [11] and [12] per Allsop J and SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1980 at [31] - [33] per Besanko J. Further, even if there had been a breach of the Migration Agents Regulations , this would not lead to a finding of fraud in the relevant sense. </sentence>
