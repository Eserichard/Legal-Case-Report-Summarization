<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1360">Thirdly, I have regard to the stage at which the application to transfer this proceeding has been made. One of the factors referred to in the cases as militating against the transfer of a proceeding to another district registry of the Court, is that a new docket judge in the receiving registry would have to "retread" the ground already covered by the docket judge in the current district registry ( Labelmakers Pty Ltd v LL Force Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 956 at [14] ). The respondents' transfer application has been brought before the respondents have filed defences and, also, before the hearing of the respondents' notice of motion to strike out the applicant's statement of claim. Accordingly, the timing of the respondent's transfer application is not a factor militating in favour of declining to transfer the proceeding to the Victoria District Registry. </sentence>
