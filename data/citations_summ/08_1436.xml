<citphrase id="cp20.15" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">migration act 1958 (cth), ss 6 , 6a. in an application for review of a decision of the minister for immigration and ethnic affairs made in 1984 refusing an application for a permanent entry permit to an applicant who was the spouse of a permanent resident on the basis that the applicant's marriage had been assessed as being one where the parties did not genuinely intend to continue living as a married couple in australia, it being the minister's policy to refuse permanent entry permits in such cases.  held: (1) that relevant considerations which should have been taken into account were not, thus making the minister's decision invalid pursuant to s 5(2)(b) of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (the act), such considerations being:  (i) a report made in 1981 by an interviewing officer in suva expressing an opinion that the marriage relationship was genuine, such report being part of the history of the relationship, all of which was relevant in determining the quality of the marriage as at the date of the minister deciding the application. although the report was not presented to the minister, it was on the departmental file and was accordingly to be regarded as being constructively before him.  peko-wallsend ltd v. minister for aboriginal affairs (1985) 59 alr 51 , referred to.  (ii) statutory declarations of neighbours and acquaintances as to the applicant leading a normal married life and a letter of a social worker as to the applicant's wife living at home with the applicant, such documents being available to the minister, but there being nothing to indicate that he had taken any account of them.  (2) that in determining whether an administrative decision made under statutory authority falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<citphrase id="cp22.7" type=cited from="[1981] FCA 41">administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 (cth), s. 44. the appellant was an alien who was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for drug offences. after his release the minister for immigration ordered that he be deported, and the appellant applied to the administrative appeals tribunal for review of the deportation order. the tribunal affirmed the decision of the minister, and the appellant appealed to the federal court against the decision of the tribunal.  section 44 of the administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 enables an appeal from the tribunal to the federal court only on a question of law. the appellant contended that the tribunal erred in law by placing too much weight on government policy and thereby abrogated its function of independently reviewing the minister's decision.  held: per deane j.</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp22.8" type=cited from="[1981] FCA 41">(1) the court's function on such an appeal is not to review the decisions of the minister, or the tribunal, upon their respective merits; but to determine on the material before it whether the decision involved an error of law.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 408">The Minister also makes reference to a number of authorities as to the nature of further evidence that may be received after judgment has been reserved ( Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Ltd (No.2) [2008] FCA 1761 at [12] --- [15], Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Lee v Professional Services Review Committee No 292 (No 2) [2010] FCA 1490 at [2] , BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 389 at [10] , McLaughlin v Dungowan Manly Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 89 at [45] --- [56], Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] WASC 129">116 Another consideration of relevance to the decision to admit further evidence is the materiality of the evidence to the issues in dispute: Osborne v Landpower Developments [13] - [14] (McLure J). Different views have been expressed as to what is required in order that new evidence can be considered 'material'. In Watson , Wolff CJ held that the evidence should be admitted 'only when it is so material that the interests of justice require it' (89). In Daniel v Western Australia [2004] FCA 849 ; (2004) 138 FCR 254 [67] Nicholson J seemed to suggest that these considerations amounted to a requirement that the evidence, if accepted, would most certainly affect the result (see also Re Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (WA Branch); Ex parte Ferguson (1986) 67 ALR 491 , 493 - 494 (Toohey J). There is not a single formulation as to the degree of probability required before it may be said that the admission of new evidence will affect the result: Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436 ; (2008) 171 FCR 174 , 216 - 217 (Lindgren J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] NSWADTAP 73">49 In addition, we agree in general terms with a submission by Ms Allars that section 73 of the ADT Act is of a character for which Lindgren J in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436 used the label 'exhortatory'. At [164], he applied this term to section 152DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), providing the following explanation:-

 
 
 164 I regard s 152DB(1) as a general exhortatory provision: it exhorts ACCC to strive to achieve broad objectives. Some of those broad objectives, at least if regarded in isolation, are antithetical to one another. The notions of "speed", "proper consideration of the dispute", "careful inquiry and investigation", "quick inquiry and investigation", "inquiry into and investigation of ... all matters affecting the merits" (my emphasis) and "fairness" pull in different directions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1140">This case falls into the first category. Here, however, it is usually necessary to show that the new evidence: (1) was not available at the hearing or could not be discovered with reasonable diligence; and (2) would most probably change the result: Council of the City of Greater Wollongong v Cowan [1955] HCA 16 ; (1955) 93 CLR 435 , 444; Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436 ; (2008) 171 FCR 174 , [209]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 917">It may for present purposes be accepted that such fundamental rules of evidence as Jones v Dunkel and Browne v Dunn were not intended to be diminished in importance by provisions such as ss 37M and 37N of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Although in some statutory contexts mandates comparable to those set forth in ss 37M and 37N may be regarded as " a jumble of broadly expressed goals " (cf Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436 at [161] [2008] FCA 1436 ; , 171 FCR 174 at 208 per Lindgren J), no mandate for this Court to act as " quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible " could act as a licence to proceed in a procedural (or evidential) manner which is unfair to a witness or a party. There has been no unfairness to any of the parties arising from the manner in which their competing cases have been conducted. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCAFC 86">44 The clearest instance where the Appellants contended that the primary Judge had erred by incorporating the criteria in s 269TG as criteria necessarily to be taken into account as " fundamental elements " when discharging the functions imposed by s 269ZDA and s 269ZDB was the following part of His Honour's reasoning:
 The Correct Test [82] ... The Minister (and the CEO in preparing the report under s 269ZDA(1)) had first, to take into account the criteria in s 269TG(2) and, secondly, to give weight to his or her conclusions on those criteria, as fundamental elements in making a declaration under s 269ZDB(1). In that way, the initial justification for the s 269TG(2) declaration would be revisited by the Minister having regard to the up-to-date information ascertained in the review process under Div 5 of Pt XVB and the purposes of the Act and the Dumping Duty Act would be addressed appropriately by him in making the relevant choice in a declaration under s 269ZDB(1)(a): R v Hunt; Ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 32 ; [1979] HCA 32 ; (1979) 180 CLR 322 at 329 per Mason J (with whom Gibbs J agreed); Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1758 ; (2008) 107 ALD 474 at 501---503 [103]---[112] where I discussed the principles. Contrary to such reliance as His Honour may have placed upon Sean Investments and his own earlier observations in Telstra Corporation , the Appellants contended that the requirement imposed upon the Chief Executive Officer by s 269ZDA(1) that he " must ... give the Minister a report recommending " one or other of those options set forth in s 269ZDA(1)(a) was not a requirement mandating that any particular matter had to be given " fundamental " importance: See Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436 at [112] to [120] [2008] FCA 1436 ; , 171 FCR 174 at 200 to 201 per Lindgren J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 241">Even had a contrary conclusion been reached in respect to the prospects of any success on appeal from the decision of the primary Judge, leave to appeal would nevertheless have been refused in the exercise of discretion. The Tribunal, it will be recalled, is directed by s 2A of the 1975 Act to conduct a review that is " fair, just, economical, informal and quick ". It is also a Tribunal which has been directed by the Legislature in s 33(1)(b) to conduct its proceedings " with as little formality and technicality, and with as much expedition ... [as] a proper consideration of the matters ... permit ". Whether such provisions are but " a jumble of broadly expressed goals " which may be " no doubt attractive in themselves " but which " are in tension with one another " (cf. Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436 at [161] , 171 FCR 174 at 208 per Lindgren J) may presently be left to one side. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] NSWSC 89">52 In Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436 , Lindgren J, also having noted that the ultimate question for the court is whether it is in the interests of justice for the further evidence to be admitted, considered a motion for leave to re-open the hearing in circumstances where evidence came into existence some 13 days after the last day of the hearing. His Honour said at [209]:
 

 
 
 The particular criterion relevant to the present circumstances is whether it is probable to the required degree that the additional evidence will affect the result. There is not a single formulation in the cases as to the degree of probability required. In Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (WA Branch); ex parte Ferguson (1986) 67 ALR 491 , Toohey J said (at 493-494):
 
 
 
 
 
 In situations where a hearing has concluded but judgment has been reserved and not delivered, it has been said that fresh evidence should be admitted only when it is so material that the interests of justice require it; the evidence is believed would most probably affect the result ; ... [my emphasis] 
 
 
 
 
 
 In Daniel , RD Nicholson J stated (at 269) that it must be shown that the new evidence, if accepted, would " most certainly affect the result" (my emphasis). </sentence>

Earlier Reasons The reasons of the Court in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436 ; (2008) 171 FCR 174 End-user A retail customer of a service provider. FD Final Determination. It is the various FDs in the 14 arbitrations under Div 8 of Pt XIC of the Act that are the subject of Telstra's challenge in the 14 proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1758">111 In Telstra [2008] FCA 1436 at [122] Lindgren J held that s 152CR(1)(a) is the factor which should be given fundamental weight, namely, whether the determination will promote the long-term interests of end-users of services supplied by means of carriage services. This was because, he held, that factor reflected the sole object of Part XIC of the Act as expressed in s 152AB(1): see Telstra [2008] FCA 1436 at [17] . Of course, s 152AB(2)(e) supplements this concept by identifying an objective of encouraging the economically efficient use of, and economically efficient investment in, the infrastructure by which listed services are supplied. Often that objective may not be attained if an infrastructure investment is not economically feasible for the service provider to make or support. So, by dint of s 152AB(2)(e) the interests of end-users may well include that the service provider is not forced to act in a way which for it is economically unjustifiable. Possibly, a monopolist may be able to be forced to lower prices or make way for competition under s 152AB(2)(e), but not to run the business as a charitable exercise or at a loss. 112 Therefore, depending on the facts of a particular arbitration, one or more of the matters in s 152CR(1) may become of greater or lesser weight in the decision-making process. However, as a matter of law, none of the factors, including s 152CR(1)(d), is entitled to a fixed weighting in that process regardless of the subject matter of any arbitration and all other relevant factors: Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 41 per Mason J; Foster 200 CLR at 452 [22]-[24] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J; cf: Telstra [2008] FCA 1436 at [118] per Lindgren J. 109 Here, s 152CR(1) prescribes a number of matters for consideration. This is a sure legislative indication that these matters must be central matters for the Commission. But, because s 152CR(2) expressly widens the range of matters which the Commission may consider, it is authorised to arrive at a final determination, after due consideration, which accords more weight to some other factor or factors than those in s 152CR(1). Indeed, the factors in s 152CR(1) itself tend in different directions. The interests of a carrier (s 152CR(1)(b)) and those of all persons who have a right to use a declared service (s 152CR(1)(c)) more often than not will be opposed. If the Commission were to give fundamental weight to each in the sense which Telstra argued, how could it arrive at a decision favouring one at the expense of the other? cf Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436 at [311] - [312] per Lindgren J.  111 In Telstra [2008] FCA 1436 at [122] Lindgren J held that s 152CR(1)(a) is the factor which should be given fundamental weight, namely, whether the determination will promote the long-term interests of end-users of services supplied by means of carriage services. This was because, he held, that factor reflected the sole object of Part XIC of the Act as expressed in s 152AB(1): see Telstra [2008] FCA 1436 at [17] . Of course, s 152AB(2)(e) supplements this concept by identifying an objective of encouraging the economically efficient use of, and economically efficient investment in, the infrastructure by which listed services are supplied.
