<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 113">However, again, these findings were open to the Tribunal on the material before it. It has not been established that the Tribunal findings were perverse or otherwise unreasonable in the sense of being contrary to all the probative material before it (see SZEOQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 257 at [27] --- [28] per Lander J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 51">Nor are the reasons for decision such as to establish apprehended bias in the sense considered in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 75 ALJR 982 (at [27]), from the perspective of the properly informed, fair-minded lay observer. The Tribunal findings and conclusions, as set out above, were open to it on the material before it for the reasons it gave. It has not been established that the Tribunal's fact-finding was conducted in a manner which could result in a reasonable apprehension of bias in the sense of a failure to bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided. The Tribunal's fact-finding was not unreasoned or mere assertion lacking reasoned foundation such as was considered in NADH of 2001 and Others v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 (and see SZEOQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 257). It gave reasons in relation to its findings about the weight to be given to supporting evidence (cf SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 101 ALD 295). The s.424A letter was not expressed in terms indicative of a " closed mind " (cf SZKBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 317 ; (2008) 101 ALD 61). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 782">11 These findings of the Tribunal were based upon a consideration of the entirety of the evidence which was placed before it, including the evidence advanced by the now Appellant. Those findings of the Tribunal were open to it to be made. Clearly, the ultimate findings and reasons were based upon an assessment of the Appellant's credibility. The task of making those findings has been entrusted to the Tribunal, and not the Federal Magistrates Court or (more relevantly) to this Court on appeal: Nguyen v Migration Review Tribunal [2008] FCA 524 at [15] per Logan J. Findings of credibility are findings " par excellence " entrusted to the Tribunal: Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 at [67] , [2000] HCA 1 ; 168 ALR 407 at 423 per McHugh J; SZKQQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 242 at [21] per Middleton J; SZEOQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 257 at [27] per Lander J. </sentence>
