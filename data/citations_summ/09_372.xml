<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 300">This court is within the definition of "Court" for these purposes: Corporations Act , s 58AA. The Republic of Singapore is one of the "prescribed countries" referred to in s 581(2)(a)(iii): Corporations Regulations , reg 5.6.74(f). In addition, the subject matter of the present application is within the s 580 definition of "external administration matter" because it is "a matter relating to . . . winding up, outside Australia, a body corporate". A company incorporated under the Singapore Companies Act is, by virtue of s 19(5) of that Act, a "body corporate" and the process of winding up under Part X of that Act is very similar to the corresponding process under the Australian legislation, so that there is no difficulty in characterising it as the "winding up", in Singapore (and therefore "outside Australia"), of "a body corporate". The questions that can sometimes arise when there is a need to classify foreign proceedings for the purposes of our law do not arise here: compare ML Ubase Holdings Co Ltd v Trigem Computer Inc [2007] NSWSC 859; (2007) 69 NSWLR 577 ; Hur v Samsun Logix Corporation [2009] FCA 372.
