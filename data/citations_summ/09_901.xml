<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VSC 50">24 In the first place, the liquidators' duties, as liquidators of TSL, are not solely to the growers under the scheme. Finkelstein J said in Timbercorp Securities Limited (In Liquidation) v WA Chip and Pulp Co Pty Ltd: [25] 
 
 
 It is, I think, necessary to say something about the position of a liquidator of a responsible entity which is in the course of being wound up in insolvency. The liquidator is fiduciary. The principal beneficiaries of the duties owed by the liquidator in their capacity as a fiduciary are those who are interested in the liquidation, namely the creditors and members.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] VSC 530">46 In the context of reference to the discussion of these proposals I should reaffirm the position that it is not the role of the Court to compare proposals or bids of this nature; it is for the commercial judgment of the liquidators in this instance. 47 Finally, it was submitted in support of the Horden application that the liquidators have a conflict of duty in that they hold a 19.4 per cent equity interest in Boundary Bend Ltd, and I refer to paragraph 69(f) of Mr Korda's affidavit. 48 Reference was made to a number of authorities in support of the proposition that the liquidators have a duty to act in the best interests of creditors and others interested in the winding up of all companies of which they are liquidators, referring particularly to the case of Timbercorp Securities in Liquidation v Western Australian Chip &amp; Pulp Co. [2] . 49 In terms of conflicting duties particular reference is made to the judgment of His Honour Finkelstein J, in the Federal Court in a case of re Greight Pty Ltd. [3] His Honour said: 
 
 
 ... If there are, or are likely to be disputes between companies in liquidation that are under the control of one liquidator, then as a general rule different persons should be appointed as liquidator to each company.</sentence>
