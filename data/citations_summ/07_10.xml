<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 288">In Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10 (15 January 2007) Besanko J held, in relation to section 178 of the Act that: (a) The fundamental purpose of section 178 of the Act is to give the court the power in a supervisory role, to review acts, omissions or decisions of a Official Trustee in bankruptcy made in the course of the administration of a bankrupt's estate on the application of any person with appropriate understanding. (b) Its operation is to be understood in its historical context ( Macchia v Nilant [2001] FCA 7 ; [2001] FCA 7 ; (2001) 110 FCR 101 at 119 per French J), and in the context of the broader relationship between the court and the Official Trustee in bankruptcy as an officer of the court ( Macchia at 116). Indeed, section 178 of the Act is typically employed where an allegation of misconduct or error by a Official Trustee in bankruptcy arises ( Macchia v Nilant [2001] FCA 7 ; (2001) 110 FCR 101 at 120 per French J; Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10 (15 January 2007) per Besanko J). 37. For present purposes it is sufficient to note the following points about the scope of the section: (a) Under the section, the court is fulfilling a supervisory role judicially, rather than an administrative role standing in the shoes of the Official Trustee. Counsel for the First Respondent conveniently sets out some of the legal principles arising from section 178 in paragraphs 36 and 37 of the First Respondent's Outline of Facts and Contentions, and I incorporate and adopt those paragraphs into my reasons, as follows: 36. In Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10 (15 January 2007) Besanko J held, in relation to section 178 of the Act that: (a) The fundamental purpose of section 178 of the Act is to give the court the power in a supervisory role, to review acts, omissions or decisions of a Official Trustee in bankruptcy made in the course of the administration of a bankrupt's estate on the application of any person with appropriate understanding. (b) Its operation is to be understood in its historical context ( Macchia v Nilant [2001] FCA 7 ; [2001] FCA 7 ; (2001) 110 FCR 101 at 119 per French J), and in the context of the broader relationship between the court and the Official Trustee in bankruptcy as an officer of the court ( Macchia at 116). Indeed, section 178 of the Act is typically employed where an allegation of misconduct or error by a Official Trustee in bankruptcy arises ( Macchia v Nilant [2001] FCA 7 ; (2001) 110 FCR 101 at 120 per French J; Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10 (15 January 2007) per Besanko J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 948">Mr Dubler in his written submissions in respect to the general principles of the application of s.179 referred the Court to the decision in Boensch v Pascoe [2007] FCA 1977 per Buchannan J at [10]: [10] Examination of this issue sheds light on the quality of the case necessary to order that an inquiry be held under s 179 of the Act. A Full Court said recently that 'a clear case must be made out to warrant an inquiry' (Maxwell-Smith v Donnelly [2006] FCAFC 150 at [53]; see also Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10 at [30] . The necessity to establish some adequate foundation for removal of a trustee has been long established. In Miller v Cameron [1936] HCA 13 ; (1936) 54 CLR 572 Dixon J with whom Evatt and McTiernan JJ agreed) said (at 580---581): The jurisdiction to remove a trustee is exercised with a view to the interests of the beneficiaries, to the security of the trust property and to an efficient and satisfactory execution of the trusts and a faithful and sound exercise of the powers conferred upon the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 703">The court has very wide powers under s.178 to make such order as it thinks just and equitable. That includes the power to make declarations and orders as to the ownership of property. This should be seen in light of the court's general power under s.30 of the Bankruptcy Act (which was referred to in passing by the applicant), which is a broadly-expressed power to make such orders as necessary to deal with matters. However while s.178 needs to be considered in the context of s.30 , it does not create a cause of action sounding in damages, nor does it extend to claims for damages for losses unrelated to the bankrupt estate, whether arising in tort or otherwise (see Macchia v Nilant (2001) 110 FCR 101 ; [2001] FCA 7 ; Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2003) 126 FCR 281; [2003] FCA 73 and Moore v Macks (2007) 4 ABC(NS) 639; [2007] FCA 10). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 227">Both of these propositions reflect the purpose of the section which is to give the court a supervisory role with respect to a trustee in bankruptcy in the administration of the bankrupt's estate. (f) Ultimately the question is what result would be 'just and equitable' in the circumstances of the case. (per Besanako J in Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10 ('Moore v Macks') at [28]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FamCA 455">It was further submitted that Mr Ranteri had failed to identify any grounds for an enquiry into the Receiver and Manager's conduct. It was submitted that the onus was on Mr Ranteri to establish the grounds or case for enquiry (See Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10 and Trollope v Rambaldi as Trustee for the Bankrupt Estate of Barry Barton Trollope [2009] FCA 74. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] NSWCA 64">In addition the court will also have in such cases the discretion to determine the utility of an inquiry and its likely outcomes. For 'although the court is given a broad discretion under s 179 of the Act, that discretion must be exercised in the interests of the orderly administration of the bankrupt's estate': Re Challen (a Bankrupt); Ex parte Brown v Bendeich (unreported, Federal Court, Beaumont J, No QB 1548 of 1993, 23 April 1996) cited with approval by Merkel in Cheesman at first instance, at [(1997) 143 ALR 78] 114.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 74">In opposing the first order sought by the Bankrupt, the Trustee contends that no inquiry should be ordered, and that the onus is on the fourth applicant to establish the grounds or case for an inquiry; see Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10 at [30] . According to the Trustee, no allegation of misconduct or error on the part of the Trustee personally has been made; see Trkulja v Morton [2005] 3 ABC (NS) 231 at [4]. It is agreed by both parties that the Trustee was not present during the execution of the search warrant on 5 October 2007, and that he has not reviewed any privileged material. The respondents argue that the applicants have failed to identify or establish any grounds for an inquiry into the Trustee's conduct, and that the Court should therefore not conduct such an inquiry. The respondents further submit that to order an inquiry would subject the Trustee and creditors to unnecessary expense and trouble, see Re Gault [1981] FCA 167 ; [1981] 57 FLR 165 , at 173, and that the cost of removing the Trustee and engaging a new Trustee would be both unnecessary and wasteful in the circumstances.  In Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10 , Besanko J considered that s 179 of the Act may involve the Court in an investigation in two stages. His Honour went on to observe, at [30]; 
 
 '... First, the court must consider whether there is a basis to inquire into the conduct of a trustee in bankruptcy. Secondly, if an inquiry is undertaken, the court must consider what, if any, order should be made as a result of the inquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1977">In particular, s 60 applies only to proceedings on foot when a bankruptcy commences. It had no application in Jury or Dudzinski. By contrast in Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10 (which counsel for Mr Boensch suggested was decided contrary to Jury and Dudzinski and without referring to them) Besanko J considered an appeal instituted before the appellant was made bankrupt. Section 60 applied directly. There was no occasion to refer to Jury or Dudzinski which each proceeded from different statutory foundations. 10 Examination of this issue sheds light on the quality of the case necessary to order that an inquiry be held under s 179 of the Act. A Full Court said recently that 'a clear case must be made out to warrant an inquiry' ( Maxwell-Smith v Donnelly [2006] FCAFC 150 at [53] ; see also Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10 at [30] . The necessity to establish some adequate foundation for removal of a trustee has been long established. In Miller v Cameron [1936] HCA 13 ; (1936) 54 CLR 572 Dixon J with whom Evatt and McTiernan JJ agreed) said (at 580 --- 581):
 
 'The jurisdiction to remove a trustee is exercised with a view to the interests of the beneficiaries, to the security of the trust property and to an efficient and satisfactory execution of the trusts and a faithful and sound exercise of the powers conferred upon the trustee. In deciding to remove a trustee the Court forms a judgment based upon considerations, possibly large in number and varied in character, which combine to show that the welfare of the beneficiaries is opposed to his continued occupation of the office. Such a judgment must be largely discretionary. A trustee is not to be removed unless circumstances exist which afford ground upon which the jurisdiction may be exercised. ' </sentence>

9 The matter referred to the Federal Court by Lindsay FM was heard by Besanko J. His Honour dismissed Mr Moore's application for an order directing Mr Macks not to implement his decision to abandon the appeals in the primary action: Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 10. Mr Moore's appeal from that decision (SAD 7 of 2007), the second appeal of present relevance, has also been listed for hearing on 15 May 2007. The grounds of appeal in this matter assert:
 
 "The legal principles governing the evidence and procedures were not properly applied. Admissible evidence was excluded. The judge acted unfairly and was biased. "
 

Then follow about forty paragraphs of alleged errors, assertions of wrongdoings by third parties, and generalised complaints.

Mr Moore has also appealed from that decision. That appeal is also listed for hearing on 15 May 2007 in the Full Court. It is to be heard with the other appeal. It is in respect of those two appeals that Mr Macks has now sought orders for security for costs. I will call them the current appeals.
