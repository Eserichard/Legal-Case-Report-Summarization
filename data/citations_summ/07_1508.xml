<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 481">In the written submissions for Interville, reference was made to three decisions which are of assistance in determining the appeal. The first is a decision of Rares J in Vu v New South Wales Police Service [2007] FCA 1508 ; (2007) 73 IPR 531. At [57] , his Honour there observed that it is impossible to have regard to each of the matters referred to in section 16A(2) separately. Rather, the Court has to approach the determination of a sentence by taking into account all of the matters that are relevant. His Honour also said that in general, the sentencing court will reach a conclusion that a particular penalty is the one that should be imposed after weighing all of the relevant factors.
