<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 616">The respondents emphasised statements to the effect that the court's power to order that the costs of an interlocutory proceeding be paid forthwith is exercised only in very special circumstances ( Vasyli v AOL International Pty Ltd (unreported, Lehane J, 2 September 1996)). The applicants referred to statements in the authorities to the effect that the power to order that the costs of an interlocutory proceeding be paid forthwith should be used less sparingly than it has in the past: ( Airservices Australia v Jeppesen Sanderson Inc [2006] FCA 906 at [31] per Graham J). 
 

 
 
 23 In addition to the authorities which I have mentioned, I refer to Spotwire Pty Ltd v Visa International Service Association (No 2) [2004] FCA 571 at [103] - [109] per Bennett J; IO Group Inc v Prestige Club Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1147 at [20] - [25] per Flick J; McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 at [13]- [20], [24], [41] per Weinberg J; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 952 at [24] per Gordon J; and Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [35] .

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1518">In IO Group Inc v Prestige Club Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1147 , a deponent of an affidavit of discovery was cross-examined. The deponent of the affidavit had not opposed an order for cross-examination. Flick J described the course of allowing cross-examination as unusual. His Honour did make the following observation (at [50]): 
 
 "As events unfolded, it [cross-examination] was probably the only effective means whereby the Applicants could have exposed what they believed were inadequacies in the existing discovery as provided particularly by the Fourth Respondent. As a result of the cross-examination, the Applicants were proved right. An order requiring a further affidavit to be filed in respect to particular documents, without knowledge of the manifest deficiencies in the existing discovery, may well have proved as ineffective as the discovery previously provided. "

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1203">The stage at which a subpoena is issued will necessarily depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Such relevance as the subpoena was seen as potentially having at the time the order was made for its issue has been answered by: the identification or clarification of the forensic purpose being pursued by the Second to Sixth Respondents; and the submissions now advanced by Counsel on behalf of both Pharm-a-Care and IMF (Australia) Limited. 
Rejected is the submission advanced on behalf of the Second to Sixth Respondents that the documents have some present relevance --- be it described as " adjectival " or otherwise ( Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR at 103; IO Group Inc v Prestige Club Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1147 at [38] ). </sentence>
