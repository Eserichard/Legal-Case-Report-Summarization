<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1423">By contrast, costs recoverable under the Act are recoverable on a solicitor/client basis. In a bankruptcy proceeding the usual costs order is that the successful party's costs "be taxed and paid in accordance with the Act". Nonetheless, the Court has a wide discretion as to the appropriate costs orders to be made even in a bankruptcy proceeding ( Labocus Precious Metals Pty Ltd v Thomas [2007] FCA 1154 at [87] ). In a particular bankruptcy proceeding the Court might, for example, prove willing to allow a trustee his or her legal costs to be taxed under the Federal Court Rules on a party/party basis but not his or her costs paid in accordance with the Act. 
 

 
This observation, it may be noted, was not expressly extracted in the August 2010 judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1589">47 In the taxation judgment at first instance I placed weight on the nature of certain costs orders against Dr Wenkart sought and obtained by Mr Pantzer in this Court. Order 62 r 4(1) of the Federal Court Rules provides that, subject to that Order, where under any order of the Court costs are to be paid to any person, that person is entitled to his costs to be taxed. Costs "to be taxed " in the context of O 62 r 4 means costs taxed in accordance with O 62 (O 62 r 1). Unless the order for costs provides otherwise that will ordinarily mean costs on a party/party basis. By contrast, costs recoverable under the Act are recoverable on a solicitor/client basis. In a bankruptcy proceeding the usual costs order is that the successful party's costs "be taxed and paid in accordance with the Act". Nonetheless, the Court has a wide discretion as to the appropriate costs orders to be made even in a bankruptcy proceeding ( Labocus Precious Metals Pty Ltd v Thomas [2007] FCA 1154 at [87] ).
