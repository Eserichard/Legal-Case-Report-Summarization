<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWCA 64">146 For the most part, the law concerning the duty of liquidators to collect assets by taking recovery proceedings was developed before commercial litigation funding became widely available in Australia. But courts have had occasion to consider the impact of the availability of litigation funding in various contexts, most notably in applications for judicial approval of funding agreements of more than three months' duration under s 477(2B) or s 506(1A) and in applications for judicial directions under s 479(3) or 511. Some cases that have countenanced liquidators commencing proceedings with litigation funding were listed by Palmer J (Main Judgment at [385]): Re Tosich Construction Pty Ltd (1997) 73 FCR 219 ; Re Addstone Pty Ltd (in liq) (1998) 83 FCR 583 ; Buiscex supra; Imobridge supra; Re ACN 076 673 875 Ltd supra; Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd [2003] FCA 466 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 1347 ; Leigh, re King Bros [2006] NSWSC 315 ; Stewart, re Newtronics Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1375. We would add to the list UTSA Pty Ltd (in liq) v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [1997] 1 VR 667; (1996) 21 ACSR 251 ; Re Feasty's Family Restaurant Pty Ltd (1996) 14 ACLC 1058 ; Meadow Springs Fairway Resort Ltd (in liq) v Balanced Securities Ltd [2008] FCA 471 ; (2008) 245 ALR 726 at [140] - [152], reversed on other grounds sub nom IMF (Australia) Ltd v Meadow Springs Fairway Resort Ltd (in liq) [2009] FCAFC 9. </sentence>
