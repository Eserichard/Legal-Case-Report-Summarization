<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1149">The Court refers to the decision in SZGQZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1091 per Justice Cowdroy at [16]-[17] as follows: "In SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 which applied the decision of the Full Federal Court in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd ; [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 the Court held that a Tribunal is not obliged to put to an applicant its own appraisals of the applicant's evidence unless they are not an obvious and natural appraisal of such material. The meaning of natural and obvious in this context has been considered in numerous decisions: see Somaghi v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1991] FCA 389 ; (1991) 31 FCR 100 at 108. In Re Ruddock (in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Affairs); Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437 at [86] Kirby J said: 'The extent of the duty to indicate a relevant piece of apparently adverse evidence for comment obviously depends upon the importance that may be attached to that evidence and whether the importance was so obvious that it did not need to be underlined.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1179">The Court refers also to the decision in SZGQZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1091 per Justice Cowdroy at [16]-[17] as follows: "In SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 231 ALR 592 which applied the decision of the Full Federal Court in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 the Court held that a Tribunal is not obliged to put to an applicant its own appraisals of the applicant's evidence unless they are not an obvious and natural appraisal of such material. The meaning of natural and obvious in this context has been considered in numerous decisions: see Somaghi v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1991] FCA 389 ; [1991] FCA 389 ; (1991) 31 FCR 100 at 108.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 395">For the reasons that I have already given, I reject that as a ground. The applicant appears to me to have confused the Tribunal's thought processes and subjective appraisals with some form of contrary evidence. In SZGQZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 1091 at [16 - 19] Cowdroy J considered, with the assistance of the authorities including SZBEL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] HCA 63 the obligations of the Tribunal in this regard: The extent of the duty to indicate a relevant piece of apparently adverse evidence for comment obviously depends upon the importance that may be attached to that evidence and whether the importance was so obvious that it did not need to be underlined. In a body proceeding by inquisitorial methods, procedural fairness may require bringing the attention of the applicant to critical facts that appear to contradict, or cast doubt on, his or her claim. Where an observation about an applicant's case is one that is obvious and natural to the circumstances that evoked it, it is usually unnecessary for it to be specifically called to notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 553">Mr Sivaloganathan submits that the fact that the Tribunal did not give weight to the five documents because of the applicant's lack of credibility does not constitute jurisdictional error: SZGQZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1091 at [26] ; NZXFN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 362. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 2040">The Court refers also to the decision in SZGQZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1091 per Justice Cowdroy at [16]-[17] as follows: In SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 231 ALR 592 which applied the decision of the Full Federal Court in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 the Court held that a Tribunal is not obliged to put to an applicant its own appraisals of the applicant's evidence unless they are not an obvious and natural appraisal of such material.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 1941">The Tribunal found that the applicant's evidence that she lived in Manila (CB 16) was inconsistent with her evidence at the hearing that she fled to Manila to avoid threats (Transcript of Tribunal hearing, p.16), and refers to the applicant's written response that she was based in Manila from 1995 (CB 16). Therefore it was only after consideration of the applicant's evidence at the hearing that the material at CB 16 and 41 constituted what could be "a rejection, denial, or undermining" of the applicant's claims. Further, the appraisals of the Tribunal from the evidence are not "information" for the purposes of s.424A(1) ( SZBYR at [18]) if they are natural and obvious appraisals ( SZGQZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1091 at [16] ). Therefore the material was not required to be put in a s.424A letter. The fact that the Tribunal set out the material in a s.424A letter after it had made its appraisals did not transform that detail into "information" for the purposes of s.424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FMCA 1930">Ground three alleges a denial of procedural fairness, alleging that the Tribunal failed to give the applicant a real opportunity to give evidence and present arguments in relation to the letter from his wife. The Tribunal's appraisal of the letter was not required to be put to the applicant pursuant to s.424A ( SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18]) as its findings on it were "obvious and natural" : SZGQZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1091 at [16] . The letter from the applicant's wife was submitted to the Tribunal following its final hearing of the matter (CB 139.2) and came with a covering submission (CB 137.10). The Tribunal was not required to provide the applicant with a draft of its proposed findings for the applicant to consider: SZJJU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 726 per Downes J at [7]. As stated by Gleeson CJ in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 at [48] :
 Lord Diplock said in F Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry : ... the rules of natural justice do not require the decision maker to disclose what he is minded to decide so that the parties may have a further opportunity of criticising his mental processes before he reaches a final decision. If this were a rule of natural justice only the most talkative of judges would satisfy it and trial by jury would have to be abolished. Procedural fairness does not require the tribunal to give an applicant a running commentary upon what it thinks about the evidence that is given. On the contrary, to adopt such a course would be likely to run a serious risk of conveying an impression of prejudgment. </sentence>
