<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 605">17 In claiming that the Tribunal was in breach of s 424A(1) by failing to give him copies of the independent country information that formed part of the reason for the decision, the appellant fails to take account of s 424A(3)(a). The subsection provides that the obligation imposed under s 424A(1) does not apply to information 'that is not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member'. The Federal Magistrate relied on SZDCC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1327 at [7] as authority for the proposition that independent country information falls within this exclusion. His Honour was right to do so and this ground of appeal must be rejected.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 506">The applicant claims that information does not come within the scope of s.424A(3)(a) of the Act but my attention has been drawn to the decision of Giles J in S ZDCC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1327 a decision on appeal from a Federal Magistrate, in particular paragraph 7 where it has been held that the information does come within sub-s.424 A(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 154">However, independent country information falls within the exception to s.424A(1) provided by s.424A(3)(a): SZDCC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1327 at [7] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 112">Country information falls within the exception to s.424A(1) found in s.424A(3)(a): SZDCC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1327 per Gyles J. Consequently, the fact that the Tribunal did not supply to the applicant the country information upon which it relied in affirming the decision of the delegate does not amount to a breach of s.424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 53">Independent country information falls within the exclusion found in s.424A(3)(a): SZDCC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1327 per Gyles J at [7].</sentence>
