<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 552">As well as delay and an apparent lack of diligence in prosecuting the claim sought to be raised by the proposed pleading, another factor to which significant weight must be attached in balancing the considerations for and against leave to amend is any prejudice which would be suffered by the other party if leave were granted. "Prejudice", in this context, has a broad connotation and comprehends, for example, the disadvantage suffered by one party upon the other's late application for vacation of a trial date (as in Menzies v CRCI Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 118) , or arising from very late production of evidence on affidavit (as to which see Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1623 , per Finkelstein J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 769">But it is within the inherent justice of the Court. And the Rules of Court expressly permit it. " 
 In Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1623 Finkelstein J suggested that the approach taken in JL Holdings be revisited, particularly when a case involves significant commercial litigation. At [5] his Honour said: 
 
 "I am of the firm view that parties should not be treated as leniently as they have been in the past. Commercial parties expect this approach from the Courts and their expectation should be met.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] QSC 218">[45] In Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd, [18] Finkelstein J suggested that the High Court in J L Holdings confined its decision to a case where costs would provide full compensation to the party not in default, and noted that these days, there was an increasing gap between the benefit of a costs order and the amount which a party was required to pay its lawyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] VSC 209">46 Mr Lindberg further contends that, in dealing with applications which would delay the trial of a proceeding, a judge is entitled to weigh in the balance the strain the litigation imposes on litigants, particularly if they are personal litigants rather than business corporations, the anxieties occasioned by facing new issues and the raising of false hopes. He submits that Courts now take into account the strain which litigation may place upon those involved and the natural desire of most litigants to be freed, as quickly as possible, from the anxiety, distraction and disruption which litigation causes. [21] Mr Lindberg refers to and relies on Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Limited, [22] Ketteman v Hansel Properties Limited, [23] Bomanite Pty Ltd v Slatex Corporation Australia Pty Ltd, [24] Micallef v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd, [25] Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd, [26] Winn v Brahe [27] and Chameleon Mining NL v Murchison Metal Ltd. [28] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 303">That passage from JL Holdings does not state and should not be taken as stating some general or universal proposition that a party is entitled to an adjournment so long as the opposing party is looked after by an award of costs. As many decisions since JL Holdings have stated, the "attainment of justice" is a goal that is not achieved without a proper consideration of the facts in any given case : Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1623 , [2]; Cassar v Hans Pet Constructions Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 1386 , [18]-[24]; Chameleon Mining NL v Murchison Metals Ltd [2009] FCA 137 , [9]-[15]; Finerty v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1136 , [29]---[31]; Smolle v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2008] FCA 1065 , [68]; Williams v Calivil Park Holsteins Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 31 , [20]-[21]. The basic premise was clearly enunciated by Lindgren J at [52] in Thoo v Kelly [2008] FCA 830 ; (2008) 169 FCR 470: 
The refusal of an adjournment may amount to a denial of procedural fairness if it is likely to deny a party a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [40] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ ( Bhardwaj ); Touma v Saparas [2000] NSWCA 11 at [27] ). The procedure that will satisfy the demands of procedural fairness may differ in order "to meet the particular exigencies of the case" ( Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 615 per Brennan J). As I stated in Ali v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1415 ; (2005) 41 AAR 410 at [27] :
 
 
Ultimately, each complaint of a failure to accord procedural fairness by reason of the refusal of an adjournment turns on its own facts. Whether an adjournment should be granted is a matter within the discretion of the trial Judge (or Tribunal), to be resolved according to the overall requirements of justice in the particular circumstances [citation omitted]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] VSC 93">178 In making those observations, I am well aware of the comments of the High Court in the JL Holdings case, to the effect that, although case management considerations may be relevant, justice, not case management, must be the court's paramount consideration. However, I respectfully agree with the observation of Finkelstein J in Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GCMA Pty Ltd [25] to the effect that the JL Holdings decision is often (wrongly) relied upon in cases where a simple costs order will not do justice to the parties. I am not satisfied that a simple costs order will do justice here. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 254">The approach which I ought to take in this application is, in my view, covered by what was said by Finkelstein J in Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1623 at paragraphs 4 to 5. The principal considerations which I have to bear in mind is the prejudice, direct or indirect, to the defendants; the impact of the delay on the plaintiff's part on the conduct of these proceedings; and the reasons for the delay. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 137">The plaintiff's application relies substantially on the principles stated by the High Court in Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 . However, in Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1623 , Finkelstein J observed at [2] that: 
 [P]arties do incur losses resulting from delay that can never be compensated by a costs order. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 1866">68 Allegations of bias impact on the integrity of the Tribunal, and should be carefully and fully considered. Undoubtedly an adjournment would have been necessary if the evidence was accepted. However, while the Federal Magistrates Court has an exceptionally busy case load, there was no indication by his Honour of case management issues impacting on the exercise of his discretion: see, eg, Black Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1623. There was no suggestion that if an adjournment were granted the first respondent would be prejudiced in the conventional way other than as to costs, although there is a public interest in hearing refugee matters expeditiously: see Sali v SPC Ltd [1993] HCA 47 ; (1993) 116 ALR 625 , 628-29; Bloch v Bloch [1981] HCA 56 ; (1981) 180 CLR 390 , 395-96; and SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2008) FCA 499 at [29] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 572">25 It is also observed by Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in Queensland v JL Holdings at page 154 that:
 Case management is not an end in itself. It is an important and useful aid for ensuring the prompt and efficient disposal of litigation but it ought always to be borne in mind, even in changing times, that the ultimate aim of a court is the attainment of justice and no principle of case management can be allowed to supplant that aim. Those are observations reflect the views of an ultimate appellant court. Obviously enough, their application will differ in the context of particular cases and especially will differ in relation to an application of this nature, made in the course of a trial, in terms of whether prejudice will be occasioned to an opposing party. It must be said that in this court the reception of Queensland v JL Holdings has not been, with the very greatest of respect, an entirely subordinate one. In this regard and in the very particular context of the case before his Honour, in Black and Decker Australasia Pty Limited v GMCA Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1623 on 23 October 2007, Finkelstein J observed at para 3 that a state of affairs whereby case management directions were overlooked had as one of its chief causes what his Honour described as "the chilling effect" of the High Court's decision in Queensland v JL Holdings .</sentence>
