<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1479">25 Even in federal judicial review proceedings unconcerned with the Native Title Act , costs do not invariably follow the event. Duncan v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink (No 2) [2008] FCA 667 (Finn J) offers a recent example. In that case, (at para 4) his Honour observed:
 Notwithstanding the ordinary principle of costs following the event, there are two considerations of potentially present relevance of which account properly can be taken in justification of a departure from that principle. These are the reasonableness of the applicant in bringing the application and where the respondent, as in this case, is a public authority, the general importance both of the clarification of the law for such an authority and of securing proper compliance with it: see eg Perrett v Commissioner for Superannuation (1991) 29 FCR 581 at 594; see also Wilderness Society Inc v Hon Malcolm Turnbull, Minister for Environment and Water Resources [2008] FCAFC 19 at [7] . </sentence>
