<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 436">It is important to bear in mind, as was observed by Reeves J in Margarula v Northern Territory of Australia [2009] FCA 290 ; (2009) 175 FCR 333 at [39] , that: 
 
 Judges have a duty to exercise their judicial function and to hear those cases properly assigned to them, they are not at liberty to decline to hear cases without good cause. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 164">As Reeves J in Margarula v Northern Territory and Others [2009] FCA 290 ; [2009] 175 FCR 333 at 343 said by reference to Gas &amp; Fuel Corporation Superannuation Fund v Saunders (1994) 52 FCR 48 , there may be conceptual difficulties for a judge who is the subject of an allegation of apprehended bias to determine disputed facts for the purposes of determining whether apprehended bias exists. Some guidance is provided by the Full Court's decision in GFC Superannuation Fund and it is helpful on the point in question. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 111">12 There was no occasion for the primary judge to make an order refusing to disqualify himself because Cabcharge had not moved the Court for such an order. This failure may be attributable to the line of authority commencing with Barton v Walker (1979) 2 NSWLR 740 at 748 that formal applications for disqualification should not be entertained by a judge. Barton was approved by a Full Court of this Court in Parramatta Design and Developments Pty Ltd v Concrete Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 138 ; (2005) 144 FCR 264 at 275. This view has not commanded universal approval: see, for example, Brooks v Upjohn Company (1998) 85 FCR 469 at 476-7; Kirby v Centro Properties Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 1657 ; (2008) 252 ALR 557 at 563-5; Margarula v Northern Territory [2009] FCA 290 ; (2009) 175 FCR 333 at 340-4. Whatever may be the correct view on the proper procedure to be observed where it is sought to have a judge disqualify him- or herself on the ground of apprehended bias, it is clear that, once the judge has made an order in the proceeding, that order may be impugned on the ground that the judge was disqualified: see Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd [2004] NSWSC 270 at [9] ; Parramatta Design at 275; Brooks at 475-6. This will be so even if the order is made on a mundane interlocutory procedural issue: see, for example, Brooks , where the appeal was brought from an order fixing a trial date.</sentence>
