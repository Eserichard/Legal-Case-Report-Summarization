<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 247">The Court refers to the decision of Collier J in SZINP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1747 at [26] as follows: "Decisions of the Tribunal are privative clause decisions and as such are not open to review on the facts: S157/2002 v Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476. As is clear from such cases as Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 and NAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 76 errors of fact do not give rise to jurisdictional errors". </sentence>

And at [29]:
 
 "if the Tribunal made an error of fact, it is not a jurisdictional error if there is some evidence upon which the finding of fact could be made: Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 at [36] , Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 ".

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 752">The limitation is extremely confined". 

 The Court does not find the decision to be so unreasonable that no repository of the power could have taken it. As stated by Collier J in SZINP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1747 at [29] : 
 
 "if the Tribunal made an error of fact, it is not a jurisdictional error if there is some evidence upon which the finding of fact could be made: Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 at [36] , Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 ". 
 
The issue the applicant seeks to agitate is no more than an impermissible attack on the factual finding of the Tribunal. The challenge is no more than an invitation to review the merits. As stated by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Applicant A125 of 2003 [2007] FCAFC 162 at [95] : "Plainly, the weight to be accorded to the applicant's evidence was a matter for the RRT. It is not a matter for this Court". 
 
The Court refers to the decision of Collier J in SZINP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1747 at [26] as follows:

The Court refers to the following passages in Attorney General for the State of NSW v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35:
 
 "The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository's power.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 726">The limitation is extremely confined. " 
The Court does not find the decision to be so unreasonable that no repository of the power could have taken it. As stated by Collier J in SZINP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1747 at [29] : "if the Tribunal made an error of fact, it is not a jurisdictional error if there is some evidence upon which the finding of fact could be made: Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 at [36] , Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510. " The issue the applicant seeks to agitate is no more than an impermissible attack on the factual finding of the Tribunal. The challenge is no more than an invitation to review the merits. The Court does not make that finding in this case. As stated by the Federal Court of Australia in Lee v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 464 at [27] : "The Tribunal is entitled to accept or reject or give such weight to the evidence proffered as it thinks appropriate in all the circumstances.
