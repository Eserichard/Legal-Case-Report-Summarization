<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 85">The pleadings must identify the relevant goods or services, the geographic boundaries of the market and those involved in close competition within the market whom it is said have engaged in anti-competitive conduct. A single market will thus be identified, which will include a "market in Australia". The gravamen of his Honour's concerns in presently relevant respects, and the steps which he required the applicant to undertake to address them, were the subject of para 39 of his reasons:
 Emirates v ACCC [2009] FCA 312 ; (2009) 255 ALR 35 and the other authorities to which we have referred make it clear that, simply because a market is global, this does not mean that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products. The applicant's pleading is not, in our view, deficient by reason only that it speaks of the respondents being in competition with each other in the Australian market and throughout the world. There may be a market in Australia which forms part of a wider global market.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1464">One of those material facts, in a case in which s 45A of the TPA is relied on, is the area or areas within Australia in which particular respondents compete with each other and in which they give effect to any anti-competitive agreement to which they are parties. As Middleton J said in Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 ; (2009) 255 ALR 35 at 41: 
 
 "The services the subject of the unlawful provision must be the services supplied by the relevant party to the arrangement in competition with the other party in any market in Australia. Put another way, the area of competition has to coincide with the area of restriction imposed by the unlawful provision: see ss 45A(8), 4D(1)(a) and (2) ...". 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1317">Riverstone does no more than support a general principle that there may, for TPA purposes, exist a market in Australia even though it forms part of a wider international market. Hill J's decision was so understood by Middleton J in Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 ; (2009) 255 ALR 35. His Honour considered the meaning of a "market in Australia" in the context of s 45 of the TPA. Significantly, his Honour held (at 53) that: 
 
 "... the definition of "market in Australia" in s 4E excludes a market that is wholly outside Australia, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree...In my opinion, Hill J in Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 ( Riverstone ) was correct in concluding that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products (or services)".

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 510">It is true that the authorities, including three recent cases that have considered the question in relation to international air freight services, accept the proposition (either expressly or impliedly) that a global market is capable of constituting a market in Australia: Riverstone Computer Services Pty Limited v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] , Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2009) 251 ALR 166 at [21] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1976 ; (2009) 253 ALR 89 at [35] ; Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 at [70] . </sentence>
