<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 959">Insofar as the respondents seek summary dismissal, in White Industries Aust Ltd and Another v Federal Commissioner of Taxation and Another (2007) 160 FCR 298 ; [2007] FCA 511 at [58] --- [59], Lindgren J suggested that a test in terms such as in rule 13.10 was a test of whether the prospect was real and not fanciful or merely arguable (also see Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd (ACN 107 746 798) and Others (2008) 250 ALR 82 ; [2008] FCA 1304 and Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1283 ; (2008) 78 IPR 51). However in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 at [59] , Greenwood J suggested that the court would rarely be satisfied that there was no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a claim, except in the most transparent of cases, on the strength of the conclusion that an applicant's statement of claim was deficient in whole or in part, having regard to the fact that leave to replead might reveal material or facts, within a properly identified legal framework, that on proof, gave rise to a recognised remedy. In Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 Gilmour J at [6] pointed out that in a case where evidence could " give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1498">They submitted that the cross-respondent had got itself into its present situation with "its eyes wide open": see Merck &amp; Co Inc v GenRx Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1407 ; (2006) 70 IPR 286 , 292 [19]. The cross-respondent has undertaken all its commercial preparations in the knowledge of one or both of the patents, or at least had been less than assiduous in its inquiries as to whether the marketing by it if Gemcitabine EBEWE or of EBEGEMCIT might have constituted an infringement. The cross-claimants relied upon the reasons of Sundberg J in his reasons of 21 August 2008 ([2008] FCA 1283, [38]):
 
I agree with Lilly that the applicant's conduct with respect to its investigation of the extension decision demonstrates a marked lack of urgency at every stage. The explanations for the delay cover only comparatively small parts of the overall period between becoming aware of the extension and the institution of proceedings. There is no evidence that the applicant made its own enquiries and searches in relation to an Australian patent. 2 The first cross-claimant is the proprietor of Australian Patent No. 565856, for an invention entitled "difluoro nucleoside antivirals". This is a patent for a pharmaceutical compound (or compounds) and has been referred to by the parties as the "compound patent". The first cross-claimant is also the proprietor of Australian Patent No. 659009, entitled "stereoselective glycosylation process". This is a patent for a manufacturing process, and has been referred to by the parties as the "process patent". The compound patent was granted on 1 October 1987 and, on 14 January 2000, was extended for five years ending on 7 March 2009. The judgment of Sundberg J in Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1283 was given upon an earlier interlocutory application in this proceeding, and dealt with the compound patent. The process patent was granted on 4 May 1995, and its term expires on 18 June 2013. </sentence>
