<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] TASSC 27">35 As the applicant points out, provisions such as those under consideration may give rise to statutory rights available to State Service employees: Paras v Department of Infrastructure [2006] FCA 622 at [25] ; Quinn v Overland [2010] FCA 799 at [59] . However, the submission must be rejected as a matter of construction. First, as to the general provisions I note that whilst s10(3) requires the Commissioner to establish procedures for the "investigation and determination of whether an employee has breached the Code of Conduct", by s10(4)(a) , those procedures are to afford procedural fairness only "in the determination of whether an employee has breached the Code ...". Second, the DHHS Disciplinary Procedure is a self-styled "guide". From its terms, it is clear that what it contains are guidelines only, although it might be expected that ordinarily they would be followed. However, the framework of the scheme, which includes cl 1(d) of CD2, and par1.1 of the Guide, does not, as a general proposition, combine to produce an immutable obligation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] VSC 193">10 An interlocutory injunction granted until trial or further order will be varied or discharged where there has been a material change of circumstances since the injunction was first granted. [5] The application for variation or discharge is not a vehicle for a rehearing of the original application on the same material nor is it a substitute for an appeal from the original orders granting the injunction. [6]

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 165"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 799">In Paras v Department of Infrastructure [2006] FCA 622 , Young J was satisfied that ss 8 and 20(3) arguably gave rise to statutory rights available to public sector employees. Furthermore, as Gleeson CJ said in Jarratt v Commissioner of Police (NSW) [2005] HCA 50 ; (2005) 224 CLR 44 at [26] : 
 
 Where Parliament confers a statutory power to destroy, defeat or prejudice a person's rights, interests or legitimate expectations, Parliament is taken to intend that the power be exercised fairly and in accordance with natural justice unless it makes the contrary intention plain. This principle of interpretation is an acknowledgment by the courts of Parliament's assumed respect for justice.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1382">On the basis that Ms Jones would suffer an injury from this course of action, I consider that damages would not provide an adequate remedy. Discipline of a chief executive officer for allegedly creating a culture of fear or terror in the workplace, be such discipline in the form of termination of employment or otherwise, is a very serious matter. In my view it is likely that such a course of conduct would have a detrimental effect on Ms Jones' reputation and impose a stigma which could adversely affect her future career prospects (cf comments of Young J in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure [2006] FCA 622 at [29] ). Issue 3 --- Does the balance of convenience favour the granting of an interlocutory injunction? In relation to this issue, Ms Jones submitted in summary that: The impact on her reputation and career of QTAC taking action against her in reliance upon the investigator's report, and the various complaints and allegations, are very serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 652">1 On 19 May 2006, I heard an application for interlocutory relief in this matter. The application was brought by Ms Kate Paras, who is an employed solicitor with the Department of Infrastructure of the State of Victoria. The proceedings and the interlocutory application arose from the purported termination of her employment on Friday 12 May 2006. It is unnecessary to repeat the detailed facts set out in my reasons for judgment of 19 May 2006: see Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure [2006] FCA 622. </sentence>
