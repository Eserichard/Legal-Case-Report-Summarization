<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 43">5 Despite his Honour's answers to questions 5 and 6, he was not prepared to make the declarations sought by Mr Culley. As his Honour recorded in a second set of reasons published on 14 December 2009 (see [2009] FCA 1474) ("the later reasons"), the question of an implied requirement that the disqualification occur within a reasonable time had not been raised or decided in the Tribunal, but had been argued for the first time in this Court. That, in his Honour's view, attracted the application of the remark made by Gummow J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Raptis [1989] FCA 381 ; (1989) 19 ALD 726 , at 728, which had been referred to by a Full Court of this Court in Secretary, Department of Social Security v Cooper (1990) 26 FCR 13 , at 18, that is; 
 
There must be some difficulty... in finding as "error of law" in the failure in the Tribunal to make a finding first urged in this court. The issue, his Honour perceived, in the light of authorities such as Ferriday v Repatriation Commission (1996) 69 FCR 521 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Glennan [1999] FCA 297 ; (1999) 90 FCR 538 , and Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 169 FCR 241 , was not merely one of whether "prejudice" might flow to ASIC if an argument not advanced below were allowed to be relied on in this Court; it was whether, as a matter of law, the Tribunal had erred in law in failing itself to address the question. In his Honour's view, the existence of an implied requirement that the statutory power be exercised within a reasonable time and whether, in fact, that requirement had been satisfied;
 
were not matters which the Tribunal was bound to take into account independently of the parties' submissions. It would have been necessary for the Tribunal to find the facts relating to the time taken by ASIC to investigate the matter and issue the show cause notice and the reasons for the delay. None of this occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 54">Dr Paul Vout represented the applicant and Mr Sam Rosenwarne represented the respondent. The Tribunal heard oral evidence from the applicant. Additionally Mr Anthony Cant, the final liquidator of the three companies concerned, also gave oral evidence. The Tribunal had extensive volumes of documents filed for the purposes of s 37 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 ("the T documents") including supplementary T documents as well as exhibits tendered during the course of the hearing. Written submissions were filed following the close of the hearing in respect of the time it took the respondent, after the filing of the s 533 liquidators' reports to commence the administrative action which led to the applicant's disqualification. The Federal Court held in Kardas v Australian Securities Commission [2] that a notice commencing such proceedings ought be issued by ASIC within a reasonable time. Leave was given for the parties to file submissions following the judgment of Tracey J, dealing with the same topic, in Culley v Australia Securities and Investments Commission . [3] </sentence>
