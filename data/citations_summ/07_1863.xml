<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 466">Self-evidently the present proceeding was a trial not an appeal. In Wilderness Society the trial judge had ordered that the applicant pay the respondents' costs of the application: see [2007] FCA 1863. This order was not disturbed on appeal. The appeal was, initially, dismissed with costs: see [2007] FCAFC 175 ; (2007) 166 FCR 154 at 178 [93] . On the application of the appellant the costs order was recalled. Having considered the parties' submissions on costs the apportionment order was made. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 218">The applicant ('Austrade') submits that it is entitled to an order that the respondent ('Isaac Jewellery') pay its costs in consequence of the determination of the Court in favour of Austrade that the challenged decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') be set aside and be re-determined. Austrade submits that in accordance with the usual principle that costs follow the event, an award of costs should be made in its favour. In support of its submission Austrade relies upon the decision of the Full Bench in Ruddock and Others v Vadarlis and Others (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229 which extensively considered the principles to be applied by the Court when exercising its discretion to award costs. Ruddock was followed in The Wilderness Society Inc v Turnbull, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and Another [2007] FCA 1863 ; (2007) 98 ALD 651 and Wilderness Society Inc v Turnbull, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and Another [2008] FCAFC 19 ; (2008) 101 ALD 1. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1367">23 The costs order at first instance was that the appellant (the then applicant) should pay the costs of both the Minister and the putative developer (see The Wilderness Society Inc v Turnbull, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources [2007] FCA 1863 (2007) 98 ALD 651). That order was not challenged on the appeal. The primary judge, after referring to Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 81 ALR 166 ; and Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc v Minister for the Environment (No 5) [1998] FCA 432 ; (1998) 84 FCR 186 , considered whether there were sufficient public interest considerations connected with or leading up to the litigation that warranted a departure from or outweighed the consideration that a wholly successful respondent would ordinarily be awarded costs, but was not persuaded that that was the case: see at [30], 657. His Honour said the decision on that question was "finely balanced" at [31], 657.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 900">2 The general rule is that the losing party should pay the successful party's costs. As the Full Court pointed out in Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth [2006] FCAFC 51 ; (2006) 230 ALR 411 at [6] , the fact that the unsuccessful party was raising a matter of public interest does not necessarily warrant a departure from this rule. In the same vein Marshall J said in Wilderness Society Inc v Turnbull [2007] FCA 1863 ; (2007) 98 ALD 651 at [30] :
 The real issue is not what is considered to be in the public interest or whether public interest considerations are a recognised exception to the usual rule, but rather, whether it can be said that there are sufficient public interest related reasons connected with or leading up to the litigation that warrant a departure from or outweigh the important consideration that a wholly successful respondent would ordinarily be awarded its costs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1864">3 The submissions on costs from the applicant and the respondents overlap substantially with the submissions on costs relied on in The Wilderness Society proceeding, as the proceedings were heard together and evidence in one was evidence in the other: see, The Wilderness Society Inc. v The Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources [2007] FCA 1863 (TWS proceeding). These reasons should be read in conjunction with the reasons published in the TWS proceeding today. </sentence>
