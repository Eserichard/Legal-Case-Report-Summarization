<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1022">In the present case, the Tribunal was satisfied that the past events of persecution outlined by the applicant had occurred. Rajalingam has also been applied in these situations. 
In SBBC v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 925 , the Tribunal accepted that the applicant had previously been persecuted but concluded that (at [13]): 
 
 "Given the ongoing presence and interest of Western powers in Afghanistan and their keen desire to prevent the re-emergence of the Taliban, its chance of becoming a force that is able to take control of the country again, conscript men at will and persecute particular minorities, is remote. 
 On the basis of the evidence referred to above I find that the Taliban have been removed from power in Afghanistan. I do not accept that there is more than a remote chance of the Taliban re-emerging as a viable political movement in Afghanistan in the reasonably foreseeable future.</sentence>
