151 More is required than proof of a retention of a benefit, that is there must be some additional factor rendering retention of the benefit 'unjust' in the relevant sense. This is clear from what was said by Deane J in Pavey &amp; Matthews Pty Ltd v Paul [1987] HCA 5 ; (1987) 162 CLR 221 and in Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 748 , and from the recognition in David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1992] HCA 48 ; (1992) 175 CLR 353 , at 378-379, (by Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) that:

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] NSWSC 1118">266 Ms Darmanin did not expressly plead an entitlement to relief on the basis of there being an unjust enrichment of the Cowans at the expense of Ms Darmanin though this was said to be akin to the claim of unconscionability as pleaded. The authors of Mason &amp; Carter's Restitution Law in Australia Butterworths, Sydney, 2008, at [2904], (and see also the decision of Weinberg J in Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 748 , at [111]) refer to the degree of specificity of the pleadings required properly to claim an entitlement to restitution on the basis of unjust enrichment. In any event, even if the claim is founded on unjust enrichment it cannot be said that the existence of the cottage on the Cowans' land could truly enrich the Cowans given the current demolition order, nor does there seem to be any free acceptance by the Cowans of a benefit conferred on them which might support an unjust enrichment claim of that kind. Rather, the Cowans appear to have been left with the cost of demolition of Ms Darmanin's property which she has chosen not to remove from their land.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] NSWSC 386">217 Weinberg J in Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 748 , at [111], approved the observations of Mason, Carter and Tolhurst in Mason &amp; Carter's Restitution Law in Australia, 1 st edn, Butterworths, 1995, to the effect that a pleading that simply asserts that a plaintiff was unjustly enriched at a defendant's expense will usually be insufficient and that what is required is that the basis of the allegation be explained in the pleading, quoting the following passage from that text (at [2904]):
 
 
 In light of the general statements in David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia, courts have been averse to pleadings which simply appeal to 'idiosyncratic notions of what is fair and just'; Pavey Matthews v Paul; Lumbers v Cook , or which plead generalised claims based on unjust enrichment ; Coshott v Lenin [2007] NSWCA 153 , at [8]-[11]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCAFC 94">The power to award interest in a Federal Court proceeding is conferred by s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the FCA"). Section 51A of the FCA relevantly provides that the Court shall upon application, unless good cause is shown to the contrary, order interest upon the sum for which judgment is given for "the whole or any part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date as of which judgment is entered". In short, there exists a discretion to award interest for only part of the period over which a proceeding is pursued: see Golden West Refining Corp Ltd v Daly Laboratories Pty Ltd [1995] FCA 1030 ; (1995) ATPR 41-378 ; Elsinora Global Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 156 ; (2006) 155 FCR 413 at [63] . The discretion is broad: see Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 748 at [114] - [116]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] NSWLEC 183">33 In the Federal Court of Australia, the decisions of Woodward J in Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants (1988) 81 ALR 397 (" Fountain "); Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company and Another v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 (" Colgate "); and Burchett J in One.Tel Ltd and Others v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548 (" One.Tel ") are often useful, and I have also had regard to that of Weinberg J in Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd (No.2) [2006] FCA 748 (" Lactos ").</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] NSWADT 108">140 In Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 748 (15 June 2006) the Federal Court (Weinberg J) dealt with similar issues. In an earlier judgment in the same proceedings the Court had, in response to an application by the tenant of factory premises, held that the landlord had breached the covenant relating to the procedure to be followed prior to increasing rent: Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 2006 219). The Court deferred dealing with the question of the appropriate orders for relief. The second judgment dealt with that matter. It also dealt with a fresh development. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] VCAT 68">16 According to Mr Northrop, the present lessor was far more worthy of censure than the lessor in the Dog Depot case. It was called upon to provide a disclosure statement and simply refused to do so. Moreover, the claim in the present proceeding is to recover moneys paid under compulsion, not under mistake. He noted that in Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 748 Weinberg J distinguished the Dog Depot case. 12 According to Mr Parncutt, the question of what was a reasonable allowance for use and occupation was purely a matter of fact. He referred to Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 748 per Weinberg J. He said that the reasonable allowance was determined by concluding what the occupation of the premises was worth. He referred to Bradbrook MacCallum &amp; Moore Australian Real Property Law paragraph [1077] and Foa The General Law of Landlord and Tenant (7 th edition 1947) Vol 1 paragraph [613] and [634]. He also referred to The Mayor of Thetford v Tyler [1845] EngR 1243 ; (1845) 8 QB 95. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2006] NFSC 10">Costs follow the event unless the court, for good cause, orders otherwise. For example, it may be that the costs of the matter have been increased significantly by one or more issues on which the successful party failed. In such a case, the successful party may not only be deprived of the costs associated with those issues, but also ordered to pay the other side's costs in relation to them: Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 748. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2006] NSWLEC 463">24 The council submitted that, using a broad approach, I should assess the said discount at 15 percent, rather than put the parties to the further expense of an assessment of costs, with potential for disputation, on this point. Such an approach is within the Court's discretion. For example, in Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) [1986] FCA 382 ; (1986) ATPR 40-748 , although the applicant had failed in the majority of the causes of action pleaded, Toohey J awarded him 75 percent of his costs on the basis that the applicant had " succeeded in his primary aim ", and that it had " failed on some issues in circumstances where, not only should he not have the costs of those issues, but there should be some compensation for the respondents for the time taken in meeting those issues both prior to and at the hearing " (at 48,137). In Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 748 at [148] , Weinberg J determined that the applicant should only have 20 percent of its costs paid. The applicant in that case had been successful only on a very narrow claim, which required little evidence and was raised only shortly prior to the commencement of the trial, in the context of a sizeable commercial dispute which required eight days of hearing. I accept in principle the council's submission that I should attribute a percentage to the discount. Doing the best I can on the material before me, I also accept 15 percent as an appropriate discount. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2006] NSWLEC 462">52 The principles concerning when indemnity costs should be ordered were addressed by this Court in Westfield Management Ltd v Direct Factory Outlets Homebush Pty Ltd (No 4) [2005] NSWLEC 168 (Pain J) and Jacobson v Ballina Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 375 (Jagot J) . In Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 748 at [171] , Weinberg J approved the following summary of principles relating to the imposition of indemnity costs by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 233 --- 234:
 In consequence of the settled practice which exists, the Court ought not usually make an order for the payment of costs on some basis other than the party and party basis. The circumstances of the case must be such as to warrant the Court in departing from the usual course. That has been the view of all judges dealing with applications for payment of costs on the indemnity or some other basis whether here or in England.</sentence>
