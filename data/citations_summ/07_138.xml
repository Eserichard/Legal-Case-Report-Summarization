<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] MRTA 598">Without an approved nomination the visa applicant cannot meet clause 442.222 and the application cannot succeed. In Tvarkovsky v MIMA (2001) FCA 375 (4 April 2001) the Federal Court held that decisions to refuse nominations for occupational training are reviewable by the Tribunal. In Kim v MIAC [2007] FCA 138 the Federal Court, in its appellate jurisdiction, held that the decision on the nomination in relation to a subclass 442 occupational trainee visa is a separate decision that is not an MRT- reviewable decision and, if it is, it is only reviewable by the nominator. The Court relied upon the fact that a separate decision is made by the delegate that does not fall within any categories prescribed in subsection 338(9), without considering the effect of the lack of a separate legislative process for any such decision outside the criterion for the visa subclass. As it is a judgment of the Federal Court in its appellate jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers itself bound by Kim . </sentence>

This is a claim that the Tribunal should have made inquiries but it does not pass the test set out in Minister for Immigration v Lee [2007] FCA 138 , which would only make this an obligation where the information is on a critical issue and is readily available and centrally relevant.

 You are invited to comment on or respond to information that the Tribunal considers would, subject to any comments or response you make, be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decisions that are under review. The particulars of the information are: 
 
 You have been nominated in connection with your visa application by Citicare Australia Pty Ltd. Information on the Department's file indicates that the nomination application lodged on 20 March 2003 was refused by the Department on 21 March 2003. 
 
 This information is relevant to the review because the Tribunal is bound by the decision of the Federal Court of Australia ( Kim v MIAC [2007] FCA 138 (9 March 2007) where Justice Lander found that the decision to refuse the nomination was not an MRT reviewable decision. This means that the Tribunal cannot review the decision to refuse the nomination. Without an approved nomination you cannot meet cl. 442.222 of the Migration Regulations 1994 and your application for the visa cannot succeed. This means that the Tribunal will agree with the Department's decision to refuse to grant you a visa. You are invited to give comments on or respond to the above information in writing. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] FMCA 629">The Tribunal based its finding on that point on the decision of the Federal Court in Kim v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [5] , which was a decision on appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court. The Tribunal, in its findings and reasons, said: [17] A recent judgment by the Federal Court in Kim v MIAC [2007] FCA 138 states that the nomination refusal is not reviewable because it is not an MRT reviewable decision. Whilst it is contrary to earlier cases, the Tribunal considers that Kim (No.7) is currently the leading authority on this issue as it is a judgment of the Federal Court in its appellate jurisdiction. [18] There is no evidence that a nomination in respect of occupational training has been lodged and has been approved. Accordingly, the visa applicant cannot meet cl.442.222. [19] Given the findings made above, the Tribunal has no alternative but to affirm the decision under review. [6] Application for Judicial Review
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] FCAFC 42">14 However, a decision not to approve a nomination made for the purpose of cl 442.222(1) is not reviewable. Section 338 of the Act specifies what decisions are reviewable by the MRT including, under s 338(9) , decisions which are prescribed for that purpose. A decision not to approve a nomination for the purpose of cl 442.222(1) is neither identified by s 338 nor elsewhere prescribed for that purpose. There was, accordingly, no right of review available against that decision (see also Kim v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 138 ( "Kim" ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] MRTA 1215">A recent judgement by the Federal Court in Kim v MIAC (2007) FCA 138 states that the nomination refusal is not reviewable because it is not an MRT reviewable decision. Whilst it is contrary to earlier cases, the Tribunal considers that Kim (No. 7) is currently the leading authority on this issue as it is a judgment of the Federal Court in its appellate jurisdiction.  A recent judgement by the Federal Court in Kim v MIAC (2007) FCA 138 states that the nomination refusal is not reviewable because it was not an MRT reviewable decision and it was only reviewable at the instigation of the nominator only. Previous decisions of the Federal Court stated that refusal nominations for occupational training are reviewable by the Tribunal (see Tvarkovsky v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) FCA 375 (4 April 2001) and PMA4/2001)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2008] FMCA 1498">The Applicant asks the Court to make orders cancelling the Tribunal's decision and requiring the Tribunal to review the application again. The ground upon which she relies is that the Tribunal made an error of law by not reviewing the refusal by the delegate of the Minister of the nomination of her employer. The Applicant claims in her application that despite the decision of the Federal Court in Kim v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [1] the Tribunal was able to review the nomination refusal on the basis of the decision in Tvarkovski v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2] . Background
  The letter told the Applicant: This information is relevant to the review because the Tribunal is bound by the decision of the Federal Court of Australia (Kim v MIAC [2007] FCA 138 (9 March 2007) where Justice Lander found that the decision to refuse the nomination was not an MRT reviewable decision. This means that the Tribunal cannot review the decision to refuse the nomination. Without an approved nomination you cannot meet cl. 442.222 of the Migration Regulations 1994 and your application for a visa cannot succeed. This means that the Tribunal will agree with the Department's decision to refuse to grant you a visa. [5]  The Tribunal went on to say: Prior to the decision of Kim v MIAC [2007] FCA 138 , it was considered that decisions to refuse nominations for occupational training were reviewable by the Tribunal (see Tvarkovsky [13] v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) FCA 375 (4 April 2001) and PMA 4/2001)). The Tribunal considers that the applicant has provided evidence indicating that she has ongoing occupational training, comprising her TAFE studies and workplace training. In such circumstances may have approved the nomination for occupational training and considers it unfortunate that it was refused by the delegate given that there was evidence provided to the Department establishing the applicant's ongoing training. However, as previously stated, the Tribunal is unable to review the Department's refusal of the nomination for workplace training made by Strobe Hair. [14] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] FMCA 1546">It is convenient to consider the second ground first and the issues that arise from that ground insofar as it is taken as an assertion that the Tribunal had an obligation to review the refusal of the nomination application as part of its review of the refusal of the visa application. I note that the basis on which the matter was remitted by consent to the Tribunal on 5 March 2007 suggested that the Tribunal had such an obligation. However there is subsequent appellate authority of the Federal Court of Australia to the contrary in Kim v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 138 of 9 March 2007. In Kim Lander J considered a Tribunal review of the refusal of an application for the same class of visa in issue in this case (indeed the same subclass) to which the criterion in subclause 442.222 applied where the nomination had been refused by the Department. </sentence>

Furthermore, if the decision to refuse the nomination was an MRT-reviewable decision, it could only have been reviewable by virtue of s.338(9).

The Tribunal noted that the applicant: did not provide any detail about the proposed training and whether it would enhance her skills, or about the capacity of the nominator to provide training; did not provide any detail about why she believed the occupational opportunities available to Australian residents would not be adversely affected, except that she would return to Korea at the end of her training; did not avail herself of the opportunity to present arguments to the Tribunal. The Tribunal made the following findings and comments: it was bound by the Federal Court decision in Kim v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 138 ; it was not satisfied that there was any evidence before it that indicated that the applicant's nomination had been approved by the Minister. For that reason, it found that there was not an approved nomination for occupational training by Transworld and therefore the applicant did not meet subclause 442.222(1); it acknowledged that prior to Kim , decisions to refuse nominations for occupational training were reviewable by the Tribunal (see Tvarkovsky v Minister for Immigration [2001] FCA 365).
