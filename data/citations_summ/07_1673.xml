<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1065">2 On 7 November 2007, the docket Judge, Weinberg J, dismissed the proceeding as against the Bank pursuant to O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules : see Smolle v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited [2007] FCA 1673. The first of two applications now before the court is an application by the applicants for an extension of time to file and serve a Notice of Appeal from that judgment. However, the applicants accepted that the judgment was interlocutory, and that leave to appeal was required. Their application was treated as an application for an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal and, in the event that such an extension were granted, as the application for leave to appeal itself. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1967">1 On 7 November 2007 I ordered that the application brought by the applicants against the first respondent, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ("the Bank"), be summarily dismissed: Smolle v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited [2007] FCA 1673. I did so on the basis that the application disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The Bank now seeks an order that its costs be paid by the applicants on an indemnity basis. That application is made on the basis that the proceeding was commenced and continued in circumstances where the applicants, properly advised, ought to have known that they had no chance of success. </sentence>
