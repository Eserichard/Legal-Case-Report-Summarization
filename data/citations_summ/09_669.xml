<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 7">98 Harbour City and Ms Robertson appealed to this Court. On 19 June 2009 a judge of the Court upheld the appeal and set aside the orders of the Industrial Magistrate ( Harbour City Real Estate Pty Ltd t/as Re/Max Harbour City Real Estate (ACN 111 210 023) v Cargill (No 3) [2009] FCA 669). The primary judge took the view that the third alternative under the undertaking applied to Ms Cargill. He said (at [48]):
 ... in my respectful view, the third option was open under the undertaking notwithstanding the fact that there is no independent panel to assess the qualities which are described in the third option. </sentence>
