<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 2056">32 Insofar as relief under s 1322 CA is concerned, the interests of the applicants for shares are also to be considered. As Lindgren J concluded in Re NuSep Ltd [2007] FCA 613 at [33] :
 
 ... it would fulfil the expectations of shareholders and optionholders that their shares and options be admitted to quotation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 956">7 The principles applicable to this application have been discussed by Lindgren J in Re Insurance Australia Group Ltd [2003] FCA 581 ; (2003) 128 FCR 581 and Re NuSep Ltd [2007] FCA 613. Applying those principles, I am satisfied that there is a discretion to make an order to regularise the present situation and I am satisfied that, subject to the question of substantial injustice, the inadvertent nature of the irregularity and the short time span involved favour grant of the relief sought. </sentence>
