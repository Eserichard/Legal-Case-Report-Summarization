<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 422">Telstra opposed the tender of those paragraphs of the Lee Outline and the attachments, the subject of the grant of leave to use referred to in [41] above, on the ground that they were privileged, but fairly conceded that the weight of authority, in particular authority binding on me, was against its submission. The prevailing authority in this Court is in favour of the filing and service of an outline of evidence being a full waiver of privilege, such that the outline is then protected only by the implied undertaking to the Court not to use the document other than for the purpose of the proceeding without the leave of the Court: Liberty Funding Pty Ltd v Phoenix Capital Limited [2005] FCAFC 3 ; (2005) 218 ALR 283 at [20] --- [23]; Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 at [15] --- [19] per Gordon J; ACCC v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 678 at [122] --- [130] per Finn J; Australian Medi-Care Co Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd (No. 3) [2008] FCA 976 at [15] per Lander J. Once leave is granted to use the document, the party seeking to do so is released from the implied undertaking and may use it accordingly. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 32">95 Since the hearing of this appeal, the decision of Gordon J has been considered by Finn J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 678 , where his Honour made the following observations:
 123 The case law in this country is discordant on whether one party to a proceedings can seek to tender admissions made in a witness statement or affidavit filed and served by another party in that proceeding pursuant to rule of court or court order, but who does not call the maker of that statement or read that affidavit. On one view, the statement or affidavit remains subject to legal professional privilege; on the other, filing and service operates, without more, as a full or limited waiver: see generally Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2008] FCA 88 at [12] - [19] where the case law has been helpfully reviewed by Gordon J. 124 As I am in entire agreement with the conclusions reached by her Honour on the proper approach to be taken to the question in a case such as the present --- particularly in light of observations made by the Full Court of this Court in Liberty Funding Pty Ltd v Phoenix Capital Ltd [2005] FCAFC 3 ; (2005) 218 ALR 283 at [25] --- my comments will be brief.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1545">21 Proceedings to recover a civil penalty under s 42Y of the Therapeutic Goods Act , like proceedings under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act , are civil proceedings (s 42Y(4)) and by virtue of s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) attract the civil standard of proof, including for present purposes the principles in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 361---3. Section 140 provides as follows:
 Civil proceedings: standard of proof (1) In a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: (a) the nature of the cause of action or defence; and (b) the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding; and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged. It has been said by the Full Court of this Court that the discussion by Dixon J in Briginshaw v Briginshaw " of how the civil standard of proof operates appositely expresses the considerations which s 140(2) of the Evidence Act now requires a court to take into account ": Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 at [31] , [2007] FCAFC 132 ; 162 FCR 466 at 480 per Weinberg, Bennett and Rares JJ. See also: Employment Advocate v Williamson [2001] FCA 1164 at [65] , [2001] FCA 1164 ; 111 FCR 20 at 40---1 per Branson J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union [2008] FCA 678 at [13] per Finn J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 976">13 The two most recent decisions in this Court, Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 678 , indicate that any legal professional privilege in the statement is lost when the document is filed.</sentence>
