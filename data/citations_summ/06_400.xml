<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 707">While the interest of creditors in an insolvency has been recognized in general to be a monetary one (in Alternative Business Solutions Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Alternative Business Solutions (Aust) Pty Ltd (in admin) [2006] FCA 400 , Lindgren J referring to the expression "interests of creditors" in the context of a winding up application as the creditors' interests in recovering what is owed to them), there has also been increasing recognition that, in discharging their duty to act in good faith and in the interests of the company, directors must have regard to the interests of the company's creditors, particularly where the company is nearing insolvency (see Ford's Principles of Corporations Law at [8.100]; The Bell Group Ltd (in liq) v Westpac Banking Corporation (No 9) (2008) 70 ACSR 1 ; [2008] WASC 239 per Owen J at [4384] - [4450]). In Sycotex Pty Ltd v Baseler (1994) 122 ALR 531 , Gummow J stated that where a company is insolvent or nearing insolvency, "there is a duty of imperfect obligation owed to creditors, one which creditors cannot enforce save to the extent that the company acts on its own motion or through a liquidator". 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] NSWSC 488">The interests of creditors are generally expressed in clearly defined monetary terms. In Alternative Business Solutions Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Alternative Business Solutions (Aust) Pty Ltd (in admin) [2006] FCA 400 , in the context of an application under s 440A(2) to adjourn the hearing of an application to wind up a company while the company is under administration, Lindgren J said (at [9]) that: 
 
When s 440A speaks of "the interests of creditors" it is referring to the creditors' interests as creditors, that is to say, to their interests in recovering what is owed to them , not to "interests" arising from family relationships, friendship or emotional attachment (my emphasis) 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 420">It is true that there are other creditors who have indicated to the administrator that they wish to be given the opportunity to consider and vote upon the proposed deed of company arrangement. Some of those creditors are the related entities whose interests are likely to reflect the interests of shareholders and their associates and who wish to ensure that the defendant continues to carry on business in the future. I am not satisfied that these considerations reflect the interests of the defendant's creditors as creditors: see, for example, Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Alternative Business Solutions (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2006] FCA 400 at [9] per Lindgren J. So far as the interests of the non-related entities and persons are concerned, their debts are relatively small when compared to what is admittedly owed to the plaintiff. </sentence>
