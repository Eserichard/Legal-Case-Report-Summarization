<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] SASC 351">In the event that Teresa did hold Sabina Street subject to a constructive trust, she claimed from Giorgio reimbursement of various expenses which she had incurred. In respect of some of these expenses the parties agreed that Teresa would in any event be entitled to reimbursement. In respect of other expenses, the parties agreed the quantum only, leaving to the Court to determine whether, as a matter of law, Teresa had the entitlement she claimed. Giorgio's argument was that, since October 2003, Teresa had taken no steps to rent Sabina Street so as to obtain an income which may offset the expenses she was incurring.

 Judgment of The Honourable Justice White 
 
 22 December 2010 
 
 
 EQUITY - TRUSTS AND TRUSTEES - CONSTITUTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF TRUSTS GENERALLY - CLASSIFICATION OF TRUSTS IN GENERAL - IMPLIED TRUSTS - CONSTRUCTIVE TRUSTS 
 
 EQUITY - TRUSTS AND TRUSTEES - POWERS, DUTIES, RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF TRUSTEES - GENERAL MATTERS 
 
Plaintiff transferred property originally purchased in his name to his mother - plaintiff's mother later transferred the property to the defendant, the plaintiff's sister - plaintiff contended that mother had always intended the property to be his and that the defendant held the property on trust for him - defendant denied existence of any trust - defendant further contended that if such a trust existed, the plaintiff was required to reimburse her for maintenance costs of the property. Held: the plaintiff's mother did not hold the property on trust for him - the defendant did not take the transfer of the property subject to a constructive trust in favour of the plaintiff - Accordingly, the issue of whether the plaintiff would have been required, if a constructive trust had been found, to reimburse the defendant's expenditure did not, strictly speaking, require determination. Law of Property Act 1936 (SA) s 29 ; Law of Property Act 1925 (UK) s 53, referred to. Hodgson v Marks [1971] Ch 892 , discussed.
