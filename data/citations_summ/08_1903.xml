<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 297">The doctrines set out above have a number of technical requirements. The Court's jurisdiction to protect a party from an abuse of process constituted by an attempt to relitigate a case already disposed of is not limited to cases where those technical requirements can be made out: Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ (' Walton '); Rana v University of South Australia [2008] FCA 1903 at [43] . The operation of the doctrines of res judicata, issue estoppel and Anshun estoppel is subsumed into the Federal Court's implied incidental power to prevent abuse of its processes: Spalla at [59]. Justice French said in Spalla (at [66]) that: 
 
 the doctrines of res judicata , issue estoppel, and Anshun do not exhaust the circumstances in which a proceeding may be regarded as amounting to an abuse of process by way of attempted relitigation of a dispute already judicially determined. 
 

 
In Walton Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said (at 393) that:
 
 
 ... proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if, notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel, their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it is sought to litigate anew a case which has already been disposed of by earlier proceedings. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1720">In relation to the two aspects of the alleged disability discrimination by Housing SA referred to above, neither stands up to close scrutiny. As previously mention, the applicant has already brought unsuccessful proceedings against Housing SA for alleged breach of contract for bringing eviction proceedings against him in the Residential Tenancies Tribunal. The applicant should not be permitted to re-litigate those events in the context of the DD Act [5] . In addition there is no allegation in the Amended Statement of Claim or the Applicant's First Affidavit that the applicant was treated less favourably than a person without a disability. The allegations that the applicant makes in relation to attempts to have him evicted do not give rise to any question of unlawful discrimination under the DD Act. </sentence>
