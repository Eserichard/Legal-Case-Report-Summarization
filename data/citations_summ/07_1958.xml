<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 686">Counsel for Huntley referred to a statement by Greenwood J in Australian Olives Limited v Stout [2007] FCA 1958 at [33] where his Honour observed: 
 In order to maintain continuity for those persons dealing with the register, a company recorded by ASIC as a responsible entity of a registered scheme remains the responsible entity until the record is altered to name the new entity, notwithstanding anything in Division 2. 

 
This passage paraphrases subs(1) of s 601FJ and adds an explanation of the purpose of the provision, namely, "to maintain continuity for those persons dealing with the register". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 2090">1 The respondents in this proceeding are the applicants on an amended interlocutory application filed on 10 December 2007 by which they seek certain relief in relation to a meeting of members of a managed investment scheme described as Australian Olives Project No. 6 ('Project 6') registered by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('ASIC') for the purposes of Chapter 5C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Act').
