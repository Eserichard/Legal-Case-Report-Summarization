<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VSC 563">51 Huang v University of New South Wales [11] was a proceeding in which the plaintiff, who appeared in person, complained before a Federal Magistrate that she had been sexually harassed in contravention of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth). The issue, which came before Rares J on appeal from the Federal Magistrates' Court, was whether the Federal Magistrate had, in introducing affidavit evidence on his own motion, denied the appellant procedural fairness. His Honour stated: 
 
 
 There may be cases where the judicial conduct complained of may be so obviously questionable that an appellate court could say that the unrepresented party was bound to object then and there rather than chancing to how the ultimate decision may go. But, in most cases, unrepresented parties, however intelligent or worldly, will not have a sufficient familiarity with the practice and procedure involved in litigation to know when a judicial officer has gone potentially too far. Not only do unrepresented parties usually feel the ordinary, but very real, stress and nervousness which being in court generates but they are entitled and are likely to assume that the judicial officer is doing his or her job fairly and according to law. So something which is unusual to a lawyer may not strike an unrepresented party as such. An unrepresented party may think what has occurred is how courts do things, and so not realise immediately that anything legally wrong has occurred, however upsetting the judicial officer's conduct may be. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 104">3 Ms Huang's proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court has a long history. In 2005, it was the subject of a judgment by Driver FM, who dismissed Ms Huang's application for damages. See Huang v University of New South Wales [2005] FMCA 463. Ms Huang appealed successfully to this Court. For reasons unrelated to the subject-matter of the present appeal, Rares J allowed the appeal and remitted the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court. See Huang v University of New South Wales &amp; Ors (No. 3) [2006] FCA 626 (2006) 154 FCR 16. The proceeding was then allocated to Cameron FM.  53 In the earlier proceedings before the FMCA, the allegations against Mr Xiao were dismissed ( Huang v University of New South Wales [2005] FMCA 463). However, for reasons set out in the judgment of Rares J ( Huang v University of New South Wales (No 3) [2006] FCA 626 ; (2006) 154 FCR 16) , the decision of the FMCA was set aside on appeal and the matter was remitted to it for further attention. Those reasons are not connected in any way with Professor Park's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1921">9 The proceedings below were not a trial conducted in accordance with law. A Federal Magistrate cannot tender or rely on material selected, on his or her own motion, out of the Court file: Huang v University of New South Wales (No 3) [2006] FCA 626 ; (2006) 154 FCR 16. In my opinion, the proceeding before his Honour miscarried and did not constitute a decision arrived at in accordance with law. His Honour was not holding the balance between the parties, but was entering the ring as a participant concerned to find "general information" and then to put that "general information" in the form of a transcript before the Department. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] WASC 217">39 The defendants submit that after a hearing is concluded, it is impermissible to file further submissions or evidence without leave and rely upon Huang v University of New South Wales (No 3) [2006] FCA 626 ; (2006) 154 FCR 16. In that case one of the appellant's grounds of appeal was that the affidavits she filed without leave after the hearing was finished and the decision reserved were not referred to in the subsequent judgment. Rares J dismissed the ground of appeal and explained that after the hearing was finished
 
 no leave was given to file further evidence, nor was I referred to any motion by which leave was sought. The appellant did not address any oral argument on this point ... The appellant did not refer to any motion she put before his Honour to reopen the proceedings. Just as it is impermissible to file further submissions without leave of the court after the hearing has concluded, further evidence cannot be filed without leave. The appellant advanced no basis as to why she should have been permitted to reopen [the proceedings] [76] - [77]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCAFC 45">The appellant submits that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the Federal Magistrate to exercise the power to call Ms Sharp. Consequently, the appellant must show not only that the Federal Magistrate had the power to call Ms Sharp but additionally that in the circumstances the Federal Magistrate ought to have exercised it. The appellant relied in his written submissions upon Huang v University of New South Wales (No 3) [2006] FCA 626 ; (2006) 154 FCR 16 , Obacelo Pty Ltd v Taveraft Pty Ltd (1986) 10 FCR 518 and Wigmore on Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. ) v.9, SS 2483. In argument, the Court was also taken to Deutsche Bank und Disconto Gesellschaft v Banque des Marchands de Moscou (1931) 107 LJKB 386 , Bassett v Host [1982] 1 NSWLR 206 and R v Damic [1982] 2 NSWLR 750.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 11">I also called for evidence proving service. The application against Mr Fuchun Xiao has already been heard: see Huang v University of New South Wales &amp; Ors [2005] FMCA 463. In Huang v University of New South Wales (No 3) [2006] FCA 626 the Federal Court ordered a re-trial of that aspect of the proceedings, separately from all other issues in the proceedings. On 5 June 2006 I disqualified myself from further involvement in that aspect of the proceedings. [2] Huang v University of New South Wales &amp; Ors (No 2) [2006] FMCA 220
