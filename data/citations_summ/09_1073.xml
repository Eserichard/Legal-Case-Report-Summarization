<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 403">On 14 August 2009 Mr Hawkins commenced a third proceeding in the Federal Court. It was expressed as an application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice and the order of the District Registrar made on 27 May 2009. That application was treated as an application for review of the decision of the District Registrar. It was dismissed on 23 September 2009 by Stone J (see Hawkins v Kingsway Group Limited [2009] FCA 1073). In her judgment, Stone J stated (at [9]): The extent of the delay in seeking an extension of time and the paucity of the explanation of that delay would be a sufficient ground, in my view, to refuse an extension of time. In addition, however, a further obstacle confronting Mr Hawkins is that his application, should an extension of time be granted, has little if any chance of success. This is because on 17 July 2009, after the time to seek review of the District Registrar's decision had expired, Mr Hawkins made a further application to set aside the bankruptcy notice or to extend time for compliance with it. That application was dismissed by Registrar Hedge on 29 July 2009, following a hearing at which Mr Hawkins was represented by counsel. </sentence>
