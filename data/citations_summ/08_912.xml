<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 246">Barrett was unable to establish any specific instance of Ms Wilson's access to the Barrett works prior to 27 April 2003. It is well established that in the absence of direct evidence of a respondent's access to or copying of the copyright works, the causal link may be inferred: S.W. Hart at 472; Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (1999) 46 IPR 309 (" Clarendon Homes "); Inform Design &amp; Construction Pty Ltd v Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 912 ; (2008) 77 IPR 523 (" Inform Design ") at [69]. Barrett submitted that in this case, the court should infer access from the surrounding circumstances, including the Dennis corporate context and goals prevailing at the time. Barrett submitted that it was probable that Ms Wilson had access in that context, whether by her direct inspection of the Barrett houses, infringing houses, plans, photographs or advertisements, or by instructions or materials transmitted to her by Dennis Metro division design or other staff who, prior to 27 April 2003, had the opportunity for, and, in some instances, proven access to, the Barrett works. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 185">Leaving aside questions of account of profits, damages, and contribution/indemnity, in the context of copyright and "project homes" (and plans thereof), the following sample of cases (and regularly cited other authority therein, such as SW Hart &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water Systems , Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) , Data Access Corporation v Powerflex Services Pty Ltd , Francis Day &amp; Hunter Ltd v Bron , and Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd ) [134] details relevant principles: Beck v Montana Constructions Pty Ltd , [135] Lend Lease Homes Pty Ltd v Warrigal Homes Pty Ltd , [136] Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes , [137] LED Builders Pty Ltd v Eagle Homes Pty Ltd , [138] Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd , [139] Tolmark Homes Pty Ltd v Paul , [140] Dixon Projects Pty Ltd v Hallmark Homes , [141] Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd, [142] Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd , [143] Metricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd , [144] Inform Design and Construction Pty Ltd v Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd , [145] A V Jennings Ltd v Bogdan. [146] Having regard to the principles set out in these (and other) cases to which I will refer in detail as required, I move to a consideration of the following questions, which were noted earlier in these reasons. Does copyright subsist in the plans for and the house built by Solitaire? [88] I note here some of the jurisprudence regarding "similarity": "... where there is substantial similarity, this constitutes, prima facie, evidence of copying and of access...." Tolmark Homes Pty Ltd v Paul (1999) 46 IPR 321 at [33] (Beaumont J: internal citations omitted); "It is not necessary to show that the copy is a perfect reproduction of a substantial part of the plaintiff's work. " Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (1999) 46 IPR 309 at [37] (Full Court); "... there must be sufficient objective similarity between the infringing work and the copyright work, or a substantial part thereof, for the former to be properly described, not necessarily as identical with, but as a reproduction or adaptation of the latter. " Inform Design and Construction Pty Ltd v Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 912 ; (2008) 77 IPR 523 at [59] (Weinberg J --- who was quoting Lord Diplock from the regularly cited Francis Day &amp; Hunter Ltd v Bron [1963] 1 Ch 587 at p.623). [89] I note here the regularly made point that there is no copyright in an "idea", only in its expression. See, for example, Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 78 ; (2004) 61 IPR 378 at [41] "The taking of an idea, as distinct from its expression, from a copyright work will also not constitute an infringement, since there is no copyright in ideas. Such matters are dealt with later in these reasons. It is nonetheless apt to note here a few of the authorities to which reference is made later. On conscious/subconscious copying, see, for example, the comments of the Full Federal Court in Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (1999) 46 IPR 309 at [24] &amp; [39]; Inform Design and Construction Pty Ltd v Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 912 ; (2008) 77 IPR 523 at [62] (Weinberg J). On "substantial part", see the Full Court decision in Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 78 ; (2004) 61 IPR 378 at [55] ; Gold Peg International Pty Ltd v Kovan Engineering (Aust) Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1521 ; (2006) 225 ALR 57 at [172] and, at [188], "The taking of quite small portions of a work may still amount to a "substantial part" for the purposes of the legislation. " (Crennan J) Her Honour's judgment was not disturbed on appeal: Kovan Engineering (Aust) Pty Ltd v Gold Peg International Pty Ltd (2007) 234 ALR 241.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 29">The passage from the judgment of Gibbs CJ in S. W. Hart , in which his Honour encapsulated the notion of reproduction into the elements of objective similarity and causal connection, has been applied in this Court on many occasions: see eg Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 78 ; (2004) 61 IPR 378 at [43] ; Inform Design and Construction Pty Ltd v Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 912 ; (2008) 77 IPR 523 at [60] ; Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (ACN 005 108 752) v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd (ACN 088 015 267) [2008] FCAFC 46 ; [2008] FCA 712 ; (2008) 248 ALR 364 (" Metricon Homes v Barrett ") at [64]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 307">Exact copying is rarely the conduct in controversy. Normally an inference is sought to be drawn in the face of quantitative features of the plan in suit, present in the plan under challenge, or by correspondence with a substantial part qualitatively of the plaintiff's plan, or both. If the contention is that a substantial part of the plan in suit has been taken, a question of "fact and degree" arises ( Inform Design and Construction Pty Ltd v Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 912 per Weinberg J at [71]) and the "protected element may arise out of a combination of elements, any one of which considered individually might not qualify as sufficiently original to attract copyright" ( Inform Design , per Weinberg J at [71] [emphasis added]). An allegation of substantial reproduction of the work by reproduction of a substantial part will be made out if what is taken is an essential or material part of the work in suit. The phrase "substantial part" refers to the quality of that taken and the importance it bears to the work as a whole ( Tamawood v Henley Arch at [50], [52] and [54]; Dixon Investments Pty Ltd v Hall 18 IPR 490 at 494 per Lockhart, Spender and Ryan JJ; Autodesk Inc. v Dyason [No.</sentence>
