<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 58">Although the notion of " singling out " may be a useful way of characterising a particular injury in employment and has been endorsed in subsequent authorities; Byrne v Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 66 ; Community &amp; Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2001] FCA 267 ; (2001) 104 IR 195 at 199, it does not in itself constitute the injurious treatment. I am of the view that " injury " in this context continues to refer to the deprivation of one of the more immediate practical incidents of employment; Childs v Metropolitan Transport Trust (1981) IAS Current Review 946 ; Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; (1999) 165 ALR 67. This view is supported by a consideration of the circumstances which have given rise to a finding of injury in employment. These include the forced removal of a worker from a worksite; Construction Forestry Mining &amp; Energy Union v Hamberger [2003] FCAFC 38 , the attempted transfer of an employee to a worksite a considerable distance from her home and subsequent suspension in response to her refusal to relocate; Byrne v Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd (supra), and stand down; Squires v Flight Stewards Association of Australia (supra). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1470">65 The appellant referred to two decisions ( Byrne v Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd (2008) 169 IR 236 ; [2008] FCA 66 and Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd (2007) 166 IR 33 ; [2007] FCA 1384) to support his reliance on Belandra (2003) 126 IR 165 ; [2003] FCA 910 as a decision contrary to the trial judge's approach to construction. Both concerned penalties for contravention of Pt 16 (and its predecessor) and neither expressly dealt with any requirement over and above the terms of the prohibited reasons.
