<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 753">On the facts put by the respondent and not disputed by the applicant, the respondent knew that he was close to the border of the Park and knew there was a risk that his vessel might drift into the Park, but did not know that in fact his vessel had done so. Further, it was a first offence, was not deliberate and was the result of negligence, bordering on recklessness. In Minister for Environment and Heritage v Warne [2007] FCA 599 ( Warne ), the respondent was the skipper of a vessel which carried out commercial fishing within the boundaries of a reserve contrary to s 354(1)(a) and (f) of the EPBC Act. Whilst inside the boundaries, the vessel took a species of fish classified as a native species under the EPBC Act. The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and made joint submissions in support of a pecuniary penalty of $25,000 (the maximum civil penalty for an individual was $55,000).</sentence>
