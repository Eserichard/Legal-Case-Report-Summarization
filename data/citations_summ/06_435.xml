<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1136">Weinberg J indicated that where a Tribunal used omissions in a way that went beyond " mere omissions" this "amounted to a positive use of information, as opposed to an observation made in relation to a failure to give information or make a claim " ( NBKS at [38] and see SZEEU and Others v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 , SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 and SZCNP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1140). As his Honour stated, this would arise if the Tribunal " treats the omission as though it provides implicit support for a positive assertion that is detrimental to an applicant's case " (at [39]). In such cases s.424A may be applicable.  It was contended for the first respondent that the only issue that arose was whether such information was given to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review and hence was within the s.424A(3)(b) exception. In that respect it was contended that there was nothing in the applicant's evidence at the hearing that went to these specific issues and that a mere general affirmation of the accuracy of the original application did not constitute giving the information therein to the Tribunal within the meaning of s.424A(3)(b) (see for example, SZEEU and Others v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at [20] and [157] and SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [44] --- [49]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 501">34 It is not claimed in this ground of appeal that the Tribunal was under an obligation to give notice of any matter pursuant to s 424A of the Act. Rares J's decisions in SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 and SZEOP [2007] FCA 807 were concerned with the question of notice under s 424A. The third ground of appeal is not made out. 27 The first respondent submitted that the assertion raised by the appellant in the third ground of appeal that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by stating that the appellant had "fabricated aspects of his claim to enhance his application" was raised for the first time on the appeal. Nevertheless, the first respondent submitted that the authorities mentioned in the particulars by the appellant (being Rares J's decisions of SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [60] - [64] and SZEOP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 807 at [24] ) were irrelevant to this case. The first respondent further submitted that it was open to the Tribunal, for the reasons it gave, to find that the applicant had fabricated aspects of his claim to enhance his application for a protection visa.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 257">33 The decision of Rares J in SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 to which the appellant has referred does not assist the appellant. Justice Rares' dicta was directed to a contention that in "applying for a review of the delegate's decision, that decision itself is 'information that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application' . " This is not a case where the applicant for a protection visa provided information to a delegate which was subsequently used by the Tribunal. This is a case where the appellant provided the information to the Tribunal itself. 22 The appellant referred to the decision of Rares J in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [32] in support of his submissions:
 
 The reasons for the decision are not made into information given by the applicant 'for the purpose of the application' simply because the applicant for review makes an application under s 412. It is pursuant to s 414 of the Act that the original decision, not the reasons for it, is before the Tribunal for review and its statutory function is to review the decision. In conducting that review the Tribunal must conform to the requirements in the Act for the exercise of its jurisdiction, including the requirements of...s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 241">13 Information provided to the Tribunal by someone other than the applicant has been treated as having been given by the applicant for the purposes of an application where it has been adopted by him or her. See SZEEU (2006) 150 FCR at [91] and SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [36] ( SZDPY ). Similarly, it has been held that an applicant can incorporate material by reference so that it becomes part of the information given by him or her for the purpose of the application. See for example SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 and VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 3">Similarly Weinberg J referred to cases that indicated that where a Tribunal used omissions in a way that went beyond "mere omissions" this "amounted to a positive use of information, as opposed to an observation made in relation to a failure to give information or make a claim" (at [38] and see SZEEU , SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 and SZCNP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1140). While other cases concerned omissions from claims made by an applicant, in NBKS Weinberg J was of the view that such principles were applicable to omissions in other evidence before the Tribunal, at least where the Tribunal "treats the omission as though it provides implicit support for a positive assertion that is detrimental to an applicant's case" (at [39]). His Honour stated: "It makes no difference whether the omission is to be found in a prior statement of an applicant or ... in a statement provided by a third party" (at [39]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 1879">The applicant today sought to rely on SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 , however, in my opinion, that authority provides no support for his arguments or for this ground. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FMCA 1787">In SZGGT v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 435 Rares J stated at [44]:
 
 "Attention needs to be paid in each case to what s.424A(3)(b) identifies as the information 'that the applicant gave for the purpose' of the application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCAFC 162">53 The Federal Magistrate noted that in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [65] ---[72] Rares J had expressly agreed with the reasoning of Allsop J in both SZECF and SZEEU . In that case, his Honour held that the RRT had committed jurisdictional error because it had not provided particulars to the appellant in accordance with s 424A(1) in relation to his initial visa application. He held that the RRT was required to particularise that that initial application contained or conveyed an implication or inference that it was a complete account of his claim. He stated (at [72]): 
 
 "The later provision of some material fact to support a claim is often, if not usually, able to be characterized as an 'omission' from the initial claim only because the initial claim conveys a representation, by implication or inference, that it is itself a complete account. And, in such a case it will be that latter representation which, in my opinion, is 'information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision which is under review' within the meaning of s 424A(1)(a). " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FMCA 1484">With certain exceptions, s.424A of the Act requires the Tribunal to give the applicant particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review. 62. The applicant relied on the decision of Rares J in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 to say that an omission can be information within the meaning of s.424A. However, that case was dealing with a different point, namely, the failure of an applicant to mention at an early stage a claim that is made at a later stage. 63.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCA 1031">19 Authority for this is sought firstly in the reasoning of Rares J in SZGGT [2006] FCA 435. In [36] Rares J said:
 
 'In this, as in a number of areas of the law, I am of opinion that the question whether an applicant for review has given information for the purpose of the application within the meaning of s 424A(3)(b) when it is sought to say that he or she 'republished' something which had been provided at a different time by him or her, it is necessary to make an objective assessment as to what a reasonable person in the position of an observer of the interchange would have understood.. 

At [42] his Honour stated:
 
 '... The precise terms in which the republication was said to have taken place are not set out in his Honour's judgment. 12 The appellants arguments commence from and rely upon 'the critical passage' of the Tribunal's reasons set out above. That is supplemented by other briefer passages to similar effect. The appellant submits that the paragraph betokens jurisdictional error as being identical to the impugned reasoning in SZECF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1200 ; (2005) 89 ALD 242 at [26] - [28] - [30] and [34]; SZDKK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1203 at [25] - [25]; SZEEU [2006] FCAFC 2 ; 150 FCR 214 per Weinberg J at [158] and Allsop J at [220]-[221]; SXSB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 319 at [19] ; NBKS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 174 ; (2006) 156 FCR 205 at [32] - [39] per Weinberg J at [74] per Allsop J; SZGGT V Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [72] ; SZGDB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 431 at [25]- [26] and SZCNP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1140 at [17] .  26 On the issue of republication and adoption, there is a 'blizzard of cases': VWBF [2006] FCA 851 ; 154 FCR 302 at [23] per Heerey J. It is necessary, in the light of the facts in this appeal, to distinguish and put to one side generally those cases raising the issue of whether information has been given for the purpose of the application to the Tribunal where the information has been elicited as the consequence of a question from the Tribunal to an applicant. Of more relevance here on their facts are those cases where the applicant has expressly advanced information that had been initially given to the Department as part of the case on review to the Tribunal. In drawing this distinction in MZXFQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 826 Kenny J cited as illustrative of this latter category M55 [2005] FCA 131 at [25] per Gray J; VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271 at [11] per Merkel J; SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 at [24] and [50] per Rares J; SZCKD v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 451 at [37] per Graham J; VWBF [2006] FCA 851 ; 154 FCR 302 at 312 per Heerey J; and SZCBQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1538 at [12] per Bennett J. As her Honour stated, in these cases s 424A(3)(b) was held to apply. Examination of the manner of giving in each of them may be instructive in relation to the effect of the words used by the appellant. Gray J found that the applicant thereby invited reference to these materials so that it could be concluded the information (deriving from a copy passport in the materials) had been given to the Tribunal. In VUAV [2005] FCA 1271 the applicant had stated in his application to the Tribunal 'please refer to my previous statement for further information', which was accepted as being a reference to his visa application. In SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 the applicant for review had written that he had given full explanations in his previous statement and that certain matters were as he had explained before. However, this left undetermined the extent of the incorporation by reference and, adopting the objective approach referred to above, Rares J held the incorporation extended only to what had been said to the Department about his activities in China and not the whole of the information which had been given to it contained in the file. In SZCKD [2006] FCA 451 the information had been provided to the Tribunal by the applicant's agent in a 31 page facsimile including a number of other documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FMCA 1064">In SZGGT v The Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 , Rares J considered a letter in support of an application for review by the Refugee Review Tribunal which referred to a previous explanation in a previous statement and found that this incorporated the contents of that information into the material relied upon by the applicant in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FCA 667">This is particularly so when, as the Tribunal seems to have done here, it treats the omission as though it provides implicit support for a positive assertion that is detrimental to an applicant's case. It makes no difference whether the omission is to be found in a prior statement of an applicant or as in this case in a statement provided by a third party. " 

See also SZEEU at 252, 262-3; SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [72] . Although his Honour was dealing with a case in which the relevant omission was made in the original application, there is no reason, in principle, why the failure to mention a particular matter when advancing a case before the Tribunal should not also constitute "information" for the purposes of s 424A. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FCA 663">23 In NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 156 FCR 419 at 435 Young J (with whom Gyles and Stone JJ agreed) drew attention to "the importance of giving careful consideration to the nature of the information that is said to fall within s 424A(3)(b) and the circumstances in which it is communicated to, or elicited by, the Tribunal. " Although there are some decisions of the Court (see for example VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 ; (2004) 206 ALR 471 (which maybe understood as supporting the view that omissions from an applicant's account do not constitute "information" for the purposes of s 424A of the Act , the weight of authority supports the conclusion reached by Weinberg J in NBKS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 174 ; (2006) 156 FCR 205 at 212-3 that:
 
 "There is no reason in principle why such an omission (which the Tribunal views as important, and which is plainly adverse to the applicant's case) should be treated any differently, when it comes to s 424A , than a positive statement. This is particularly so when, as the Tribunal seems to have done here, it treats the omission as though it provides implicit support for a positive assertion that is detrimental to an applicant's case. It makes no difference whether the omission is to be found in a prior statement of an applicant or, as in this case, in a statement provided by a third party. " 

See also SZEEU at 252, 262-263; SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [72] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCA 826">42 The parties referred to numerous decisions in which an issue of this kind arose. In some of these cases, the applicant expressly advanced information that had been initially given to the Department as part of the case on review to the Tribunal: see M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 at [25] per Gray J; VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271 at [11] per Merkel J; SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 (" SZGGT ") at [24] and [50] per Rares J; SZCKD v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 451 at [37] per Graham J; VBWF v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at 312 per Heerey J; and SZCBQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1538 at [12] per Bennett J. In these cases, s 424A(3)(b) was held to apply. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FCA 807">24 A finding that someone has fabricated a claim is, of course, quite different in quality to a finding that the applicant for a protection visa has not satisfied the decision-maker that the claim is established. In SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [60] - [64] I explained why, in my view, a conclusion of fabrication of a claim has this substantive difference. To conclude that someone has fabricated a claim, the tribunal must use information, as it did here, so as to justify the conclusion. The way in which the tribunal reasoned was expressly to say that the identified delay in seeking a protection visa, first, 'cast doubt on the [appellant's] claim' and, secondly, showed that he had fabricated the claim itself. That was a leap to the conclusion. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2007] FCA 685">16 A conclusion of fabrication or recent invention is substantively different from a simple finding that a tribunal is not satisfied as to a claim, for the reasons which I gave in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [60] - [64] and the authorities there cited. Although this is a matter of some technicality, I am of opinion that the tribunal failed to give notice under s 424A(1) of its use of the information contained in the whole of the material available to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2007] FCA 661">16 Where an applicant before the tribunal explicitly adopts what he or she put to the Minister in support of the initial application for a protection visa, including adding qualifications or amendments to that claim, the applicant for review can be seen properly to have 'given' the initial material to the tribunal for the purpose of his or her application for review: Applicant S301/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 155 at [17] per Heerey, Mansfield and Emmett JJ. I am of opinion that in the circumstances of this case the tribunal was entitled to proceed on the basis that the appellant had given it the information in her protection visa application in the form of the claim which she had earlier made. It was entitled to have regard to that information without serving any notice under s 424A(1). The submission made by RACS in April 2005, in my opinion, expressly republished the original claim in the protection visa application for the purposes of the application for review: see also SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [36] - [51].
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2007] FCA 639">13 I am of opinion that that invitation expressed in that way, particularly having regard to the whole of the way in which the agent's letter was written, amounted to a republication of the material which the appellant put before the delegate. An objective person reading the agent's letter and the application for review together would understand that the tribunal was being invited to consider what the appellant had put to the delegate in writing and otherwise in light of the updating and other comments in the agent's letter: see SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [35] - [50].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2007] FMCA 686">While the applicant had provided this information in her protection visa application, she plainly volunteered this information to the Tribunal at the hearing in such circumstances that it could be said that she submitted this information to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review (see NBKT, M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 at [25] , SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034 (" SZDMJ ") at [5] and [6], SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2007] FMCA 250">In SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 , Rares J agreed with the reasoning of Allsop J in SZECF and SZEEU saying at [72]: 
 
 
 The later provision of some material fact to support a claim is often, if not usually, able to be characterized as an 'omission' from the initial claim only because the initial claim conveys a representation, by implication or inference, that it is itself a complete account.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2007] FMCA 200">Ms Wong submits in her written submissions that the present circumstances are distinguishable from those considered by His Honour Rares J in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 435.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs22" from="[2006] FMCA 1862">It could not be said that the applicant's letter to the Tribunal, which is reproduced at CB 68 "republishes" the protection visa application in the sense discussed by Rares J in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2006] FMCA 1795">As Weinberg J noted in NBKS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 174 at [36] , in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 , Rares J agreed with the reasoning of Allsop J in SZECF and SZEEU saying at [72]: 
 
 
 The later provision of some material fact to support a claim is often, if not usually, able to be characterized as an 'omission' from the initial claim only because the initial claim conveys a representation, by implication or inference, that it is itself a complete account.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2006] FMCA 1839">Further, and with reference to Jacobson J. in NAZY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 744 (" NAZY ") at [36]-[39], that it was an adoption "in chief". The submission was that this was not a "mere adoption" of the earlier statement in the course of a hearing before the Tribunal ( SZEEU at [20]). When viewed objectively the import of what the applicant put in his application for review was that he wanted the Tribunal to consider the whole of his earlier statement as an account of his claims (see SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [50] , and also SZHIB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 611 at [23] ). 11. I should also note that what Jacobson J. said in NAZY was expressly approved by Moore J. in SZEEU (at [20]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2006] FCAFC 174">36 In SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 , Rares J agreed with the reasoning of Allsop J in both SZECF and SZEEU . His Honour said (at [72]):
 
 "The later provision of some material fact to support a claim is often, if not usually, able to be characterized as an 'omission' from the initial claim only because the initial claim conveys a representation, by implication or inference, that it is itself a complete account. And, in such a case it will be that latter representation which, in my opinion, is 'information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision which is under review' within the meaning of s 424A(1)(a). " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2006] FCA 1598">17 Adopting the reasoning of Rares J in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 (' SZGGT ') which concerned republication to the Tribunal of information given to the Department, her Honour found that a reasonable person observing what was in the review application would have understood the appellant to have been referring not simply to the fact of his fear but also the reasons for such fear as stated in his statutory declaration. Accordingly, she found that the appellant had adopted or republished his statutory declaration for the purpose of his review application.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2006] FMCA 1710">In those circumstances, there is no obligation that arises under s.424A(1) of the Act ( SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2006] FMCA 1455">The applicant argues in his written submissions that: 
 
 
 The new harassment claims information constitutes "information" for the purposes of section 424A in that the omission of these claims from the original protection visa application is capable of being characterized as information in the initial claim, being a representation of the completeness of (sic) fullness of the material put forward: SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 per Rares J; SZEEU v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2006] FMCA 1042">Mr Potts also took me to the decision of Young J in SZHIB v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 611 at [8] and [23] [9] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs30" from="[2006] FMCA 1435">Information given to the delegate is not information given to the Tribunal ( NAZY v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 744) , unless the information is specifically incorporated into the application before the Tribunal: SZGGT v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 435 , VWBF v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 851.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs31" from="[2006] FCA 1140">The second question that arose during the hearing is whether the appellant in fact republished the information in the original application that is relied on by the Tribunal in its reasons. If the information was republished by the appellant, it falls within what s 424A(3) identifies as information the appellant "gave for the purpose" of the application for review, and therefore the requirements set out in s 424A(1) do not apply: see, for example, Rares J's discussion in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs32" from="[2006] FMCA 1142">I therefore do not need to address whether, if some information was taken from the applicant's original written statement accompanying his visa application, this was information "re-published" to the Tribunal by reason of references to it in the submissions of the applicant's advisor (counsel for the Minister cited SZHIB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 611 at [8] and [23], and SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [36] and [42]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs33" from="[2006] FMCA 1183">But even beyond this, nor does the post hearing submission itself, in all the circumstances as set out above, give rise to any inference that the adviser was acting without instruction, or on his own volition, simply because it contained some matter that was inconsistent (even glaringly so in one particular) with other evidence presented to the Tribunal. 32. Dr. Azzi also sought to rely on a recent judgment of Rares J. in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 (" SZGGT "). The circumstances in that case gave rise to a question as to whether information in a protection visa application made to the first respondent's Department was information for the purposes of s.424A(1). The submission was that the principal emanating from SZGGT was that "an objective reasonable person" test should be applied in looking at whether information provided in a protection visa application was republished before the Tribunal (such that it makes it into a s.424A(3)(b) issue).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs34" from="[2006] FMCA 69">Nor is this, clearly, the situation as envisaged by Rares J. in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 (" SZGGT ") at [42], where an applicant for review is treated as having put before the Tribunal what he had previously put before the Minister's Department merely because he was seeking a review of the delegate's refusal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs35" from="[2006] FMCA 661">As Rares J stated in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [42] , each case depends on its own facts and not every applicant for review should be treated as asking the Tribunal to review all previously put to a delegate (and in that sense giving the information consisting of and referred to in the delegate's decision to the Tribunal). Nor did he refer to his protection visa application or to prior explanations or statements (cf SZEIE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 987 and SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs36" from="[2006] FCA 851">44 In SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 , a decision handed down on the same day as SZCKD , the Tribunal had stated in its reasons that it had the Department's file before it and had considered its contents. In his letter in support of the application for review to the Tribunal the appellant, dealing with the reasons he had left China, said "As I explained before" and "I gave full explanations in my previous statement". Rares J rejected the Minister's argument that the incorporation by this reference was of everything which the appellant had put before the delegate, and not just so much of the material as related to the events surrounding his leaving China. His Honour said (at [36]) that when it is sought to say that a person "republished" something which had been provided at a different time, an objective assessment is called for. After reference to the concept of objective assessment in the law of defamation, contract, trade practices and passing off, his Honour concluded that a subjective criterion could not have been intended by Parliament in the case of s 424A. His Honour noted the earlier decision of SZDMJ [2005] FCA 1034 where Gyles J held that there was a "clear republication of original claims made in a declaration by the applicant as part of his application for review".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs37" from="[2006] FMCA 904">The issue of republication of information was discussed in some detail by Rares J in SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs38" from="[2006] FMCA 684">Ms Wong refers for this aspect of the matter to M55 v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCR 131 but she would have found more assistance from SZGGT v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 435 , a recent decision of his Honour Rares J in which these matters are discussed in some considerable detail, as one would expect from his Honour.</sentence>
