<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1423">19 The power to restrain Mr Hawley in the way for which ASIC contends, therefore, is enlivened. In the exercise of that power there are a number of relevant discretionary matters. First, I take into account the extent of the desirability of protecting the relevant interests. Although I have concluded that their protection is desirable, I do not think that the interests are strong ones. Secondly, ASIC's investigation is essentially at an end. It is appropriate, therefore, that I be satisfied that ASIC has something approaching a prima facie case against Mr Hawley: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Lee [2007] FCA 508 at [12] per Finkelstein J. That is an illustration of the commonsense proposition that with ASIC's investigation basically at an end, it would be inappropriate to restrain Mr Hawley from leaving the country if I were of the view that its case had little merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 918">1 ASIC is continuing its investigation into the fraudulent trading scheme that is described in ASIC v Lee [2007] FCA 508. To recapitulate, Australian investors were induced into purchasing non-existent commodity options on non-existent foreign commodities exchanges and lost more than $8 million. Some of the stolen money (approximately $139,000) was transferred into bank accounts maintained by Mr Lee with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited and Westpac Banking Corporation Limited. Mr Lee has over $2 million in those accounts. On 11 April 2007 I made an order under s 1323(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that, pending trial, the money in those accounts be frozen. Now, following the trial, ASIC seeks a continuation of that order.</sentence>
