<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWCA 26">But as Giles JA pointed out in his dissenting judgment in Meredith at 157 [30], s 29 is a general provision that fleshes out an entitlement to serve by post in any Act, however described. The provision contains two conditions described by Lindgren J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Trio Site Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 776 as two limbs. The first limb specifies the conduct that will constitute postal service in the absence of a contrary intention. The second limb will determine the date of that service unless the contrary is proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1858">30 Having mentioned s 160 of the Evidence Act , I should deal with an alternate submission the Commission's counsel put in the dying stages of the hearing before me. It was that if s 163 of the Evidence Act did not apply to prove service of the s 155AA notice, then s 160 did. In my view the short answer to this submission is that all s 160 does is to create a presumption as to the time of receipt of the s 155AA notice at Mr Goulding's brother's address: I do not consider it creates a presumption as to the giving or serving of the notice on Mr Goulding: see the discussion in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Trio Site Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 776 at [26] --- [30] per Lindgren J and Meredith at [60] --- [65] per Basten JA and at [20] --- [24] per Giles J dissenting. To make the link between the presumed receipt of the notice and the process of giving or serving of the notice under s 155AA, I consider the Commission needs to show that the Board has either complied with ss 29 and 28A of the Acts Interpretation Act , or some other similar provision that creates a presumption that service is effected if certain steps are taken. It has done neither. I do not therefore accept that s 160 of the Evidence Act applied to prove service of the s 155AA notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1449">33 As far as evidence of posting is concerned, Lindgren J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Trio Site Services Pty Ltd, in the matter of Trio Site Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 776 at [38] - [40] said:
 
 
 38 ... The defendant did not dispute that the statutory demand was posted to Unit 3 as Ms Taylor deposed, but I would have expected the plaintiff to adduce more precise evidence than was led here of posting. I am left to infer on the basis of Ms Taylor's unchallenged affidavit evidence that she remembered on 15 January 2007 (when she made her affidavit) having attended a Post Office on November 28 2006 and posted the statutory demand there in an envelope addressed to Unit 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] NSWCA 354">
 

63 As explained by Lindgren J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Trio Site Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 776 at [26] - [30] it may be helpful to treat s 29 of the Interpretation Act as having two limbs, namely a deeming of the conduct sufficient to constitute service (the first limb) and a separate deeming of the time at which service is effected (the second limb): see also Alexander v Stocks &amp; Holdings (Sales) Pty Ltd [1975] VicRp 83 ; [1975] VR 843 at 853 (25) (Lush J). So understood, the presumption in s 160 affects only the time, referred to in s 29(1) as the "time at which the letter would be delivered" and, in s 160 of the Evidence Act , as the day on which it would be "received" at the address to which it was posted. However, in considering whether s 222AOF demonstrates a "contrary intention" it is necessary to consider the cumulative effect of the two limbs of s 29(1). Taking the first limb separately, there is arguably no conflict between provisions which permit the giving of notice either by "sending it by post" or by "posting the document". On the other hand, if the intention of s 222AOF is that the requirement in s 222AOE is satisfied by the dispatch of the document to the relevant address, then the implicit requirement of the delivery and fixing of the time at which service occurs by reference to the time at which delivery is presumed to occur, pursuant to the second limb of s 29(1) , a clear element of conflict or contrariety is apparent.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] NSWSC 1162">But as Lindgren J observed in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Trio Site Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 776 (23 May 2007), at [18], a document may be served under s 109X(1)(a) "by nothing more than being posted to the company's registered office - posting it to that registered office is service.</sentence>
