<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 2146">I am not persuaded that my decision in SZLJM should not be followed and applied in the circumstances of the present case. As in that case, the applicant has been given the fullest opportunity to present arguments to show an arguable case for establishing jurisdiction at a final hearing. I note that since my decision in SZLJM , the judgment of Moore J in SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (2006) 155 FCR 482 , [2006] FCA 1366 and SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 974 , which upheld a similar conclusion by Driver FM, was the subject of a special leave application which was refused by the High Court on 11 December 2007 (see SZFDZ v MIMA [2007] HCATrans 759). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 1945">In SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 717 , Driver FM addressed a situation similar to the present, where an officer in the Immigration Department declined to forward a s.417 request. His Honour considered that there was no doubt that the Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the application. His Honour's decision was upheld by Moore J in SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 974 , and in a subsequent decision Moore J ordered costs against an unqualified helper of the appellant (see SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (2006) 155 FCR 482 , [2006] FCA 1366). </sentence>
