<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 361">I would further find that Mrs Ching's psychiatric conditions are diseases that there are features of Mrs Ching's employment which I have detailed that on the balance of probabilities did contribute to her psychiatric condition ( Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission [1990] FCA 511 ; (1990) 26 FCR 316). To reiterate, the features of her employment were her accepted physical condition and the continued disputation over many years with her work supervisors over medically imposed work restrictions and continued disputation because of conflicting medical opinions over her ability to undertake work activities integral to a staged rehabilitation program. Further while I note that there was a change in the section 4(1) of the SRC Act that such a contribution must be a significant contribution as opposed to material as from 13 April 2007, little rests on the statutory change as Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 had already concluded that a material degree meant something akin to substantially or considerably. However nothing rests on the statutory change as in this matter I find that issues and circumstances surrounding her work satisfies me that work made a significant contribution to the psychiatric diseases, for reasons I have previously related. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] AATA 364">Any contribution by his employment to the condition must be "more than a mere contributing factor": Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 , and in fact, the test for "material contribution" in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 requires that the connection be more than de minimis. Taking into account the dangers identified by Finn J in Sahu-Khan in paraphrasing legislative expressions, the case is authority for the principle that "a material contribution" requires at least that the contribution be "in a material degree; substantially, considerably", taking into account "all relevant contributing factors".  The phrase "in a material degree" is not defined in the Act. Finn J discussed the meaning of the term in Comcare v Sahu-Kahn [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536. The word "material" "imposes an 'evaluative threshold' below which a causal connection may be disregarded", and that the phrase "requires an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment. For an employee to succeed in a claim such as this, it is not necessary to establish that the employment is the central, main or primary factor in the onset or aggravation of the ailment in question. It is sufficient that the employment contributes to the ailment in a material degree. That is a matter of fact and degree to be determined on evaluation of all of the contributing or causal factors. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] AATA 253">The word material "imposes 'an evaluative threshold' below which a causal connection can be disregarded".

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] AATA 226">For a condition to be compensable it must be " contributed to in a significant degree by the employee's employment " in accordance with the Act. A " significant " degree means a degree that is substantially more than material. The term " in a material degree " was discussed by Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Kahn [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 , where it was concluded that it " imposes an evaluative threshold below which a causal connection may be disregarded ", and "requires an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] FCAFC 44">The primary judge noted that the Tribunal referred to the test applied in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 in which Finn J at [16] considered that the SRC Act definition requires a stronger causal link or relationship between the employment and the ailment than under the 1971 Act; and that the words 'in a material degree' required an evaluation of all the relevant contributing factors to ascertain whether the contribution was material.  In any event, the perceived benefit to the appellant of the new evidence is illusory. The appellant implicitly asserts that if his case had been treated as arising under the 1971 Act, the outcome would have been more favourable from his point of view. The SRC Act commenced on 1 December 1988. Pursuant to Div 2 of Pt X of that Act a person who was entitled to compensation under the 1971 Act continued to be so entitled. The SRC Act prescribed compensation for any ailment or aggravation thereof which was "attributed to in a material degree by the employee's employment with the Commonwealth ... ". Pursuant to s 28 of the 1971 Act, such a person was to be compensated if his or her employment was a contributing factor to the contraction, aggravation, acceleration or recurrence of a disease. The word "material" is defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary (4th ed, Clarendon Press, 1993) at 1713) to mean, for the purposes of American law, "having a logical connection with the facts at issue" and, for the purposes of British law, "significant, influential, especially to the extent of determining a cause, affecting a judgment, etc". In Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 at [16] , Finn J observed that use of the word "material" in the SRC Act created a requirement for a stronger causal relationship between the employment and the ailment suffered than that required by the 1971 Act. That may be so, but the difference is very much one of degree. </sentence>

His Honour pointed out that by virtue of the definition of "disease" (which was in the same terms as those that apply for the purpose of the present proceedings), the employee's employment was required to contribute "in a material degree" to the suffering or aggravation of an ailment.

<sentence id="cs16" from="[2010] AATA 625">In Comcare v Sahu-Kahn [2007] FCA 15 Finn J refers to the obiter dictum expressed by the Full Court in Comcare and Canute and states: 
 
 "13 I agree with what their Honours have said and, in particular, in their conclusion that the inclusion of the word "material" imposes an "evaluative threshold" below which a causal connection may be disregarded. 
 14 What is problematic is identifying where that threshold lies. ... 
 15 There are, in my view, obvious hazards in allowing finely nuanced differences in dictionary definitions to contrive the answer to this question, given as I have noted, that the word "material" in this context had its legislative meaning set in part by the qualification it imposed on the nature of the contribution required to be demonstrated before the provisions of the SRC Act were engaged. This said I consider that one of the meanings of the word "materially" in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary probably captures the essence of what the legislature was conveying. That meaning is --- 
 "4. In a material degree; substantially, considerably. " ... 
 16 Bearing in mind that the course of statutory construction is often not aided by substituting for the word used in an enactment, another word which is not so used, probably the best that can ultimately be said is that the s 4 definition: 
 (i) requires a stronger causal relationship between the employment and the ailment, etc suffered than that exacted by the 1971 Act; 
 (ii) "in a material degree" requires an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment, etc, in question ("the threshold evaluation");

Bearing in mind that the course of statutory construction is often not aided by substituting for the words used in an enactment, another word which is not so used, probably the best that can ultimately be said is that the s 4 definition:

That passage was quoted by the Tribunal in its reasons for decision. Immediately before that, it said at [82] that it is now established that the inclusion of the word "material" in s 4 of the SRC Act requires more than a minor or incidental connection between the injury and the employment that it is alleged has contributed to the injury or disease. In the context of a disease claim, that is not exceptional, provided it is applied only to such a claim. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2010] AATA 302">To constitute "an injury" within the meaning of the Act, Mr Khourey's condition, must be "contributed to in a material degree" by his employment. In Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 , Finn J said at 542 that this requires a "threshold evaluation" --- namely, an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors to the condition for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the subject disease. Even if established that Mr Khourey's condition was "contributed to in a material degree" by his employment with the Army, it will not constitute "an injury" if it was the result of reasonable disciplinary action taken against Mr Khourey or of his failure to obtain a benefit in connection with his employment (the excluded causes): see definition of "injury" in s 4 of the Act. The injury will "result from" an excluded cause if that cause was one of several which led to the development or aggravation of the injury: Hart v Comcare [2005] FCAFC 16 ; (2005) 145 FCR 29. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2010] AATA 298">The expression material degree was discussed by Davies J in Repatriation Commission v Bendy [1989] FCA 170 ; [1989] FCA 170 ; (1980) 18 ALD 144 at 146. His Honour decided that the expression refers to a contribution of a causal nature and any de minimis contribution which was tenuous or did not influence the events was immaterial and was to be ignored. More recently Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan (2007) FCA 15 at paragraphs 15-17 (and in reference to Bendy ) decided the expression in a material degree requires an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employees employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment. In Nelson v Comcare [2009] FCA 1149 Foster J discussed the concept of material contribution and aggravation, and by reference to other decisions of the Federal Court and decided that an ailment was aggravated if it was made more severe by the employment. For the purposes of this analysis we are satisfied that the word employment may be substituted for the word service as it appears in subsection (d). </sentence>

It is possible that this failing on the part of the employer may have added weight and colour to Ms Clement's beliefs, especially in relation to her perceptions about being persecuted and the existence of a criminal conspiracy, but that is far from clear. Does adding weight and colour to a delusional belief satisfy the material contribution test, especially in relation to the tests concerning the role of her perceptions concerning events in the workplace and the progress of her disease? Carefully considering what Von Doussa J said in Weigand v Comcare [77] it appears to us that the present evidence may allow a finding that Ms Clement formed a perception, however delusional, in relation to actual events in her workplace. But we are not able to conclude that the perception thus formed contributed in any material degree to the onset or progress of her already existing disorder. The material contribution required is one that is of significance in the circumstances, rising above the threshold beneath which a contribution may be disregarded. [78] It is possible that Ms Clement's perceptions played some part in the progress of her disease and it is possible that subsequent events in her employment, especially the perceived conflict with her supervisors in September 1991, may have played some part in the formation of further perceptions, or, as we have found, those events added weight and colour to evolving delusions. But that does not mean that those further, or more weighty, or more colourful perceptions were material factors in the acceleration or aggravation of her disease. On the evidence of Dr Skinner, Dr Tym, Dr Saboisky and Dr Gertler we are reasonably satisfied that they were not. </sentence>

We use the expression "material contribution" in this context in the sense it was used in the Federal Court's decision in Comcare v Sahu-Kahn [2007] FCA 15: the contribution, if any, was not of sufficient magnitude to trigger liability under the Act. We accept that the applicant's condition is attributable to issues in his personal life, such as his separation, that were referred to throughout the evidence, including most obviously in the minutes of the meeting with Mr Smith.

<sentence id="cs32" from="[2010] AATA 277">As can be seen, in relation to a 'disease' the causal test is limited by degree to some extent: the contribution by employment must be of a material degree. [41] The phrase 'in a material degree' has been taken to mean a substantial or considerable degree that is greater than minimal; one must assess all of the contributing factors when determining the degree to which employment has contributed to a disease and deciding whether that degree is above the evaluative threshold.

However, such difficulty does not present a problem in terms of the two Acts, as it seems to me that under either Act Mr Hicks would be entitled to compensation for "disease". The 1988 Act requires a "material" contribution rather than simply contribution, and I am satisfied that the evidence meets this threshold. In Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 , Finn J, adopting the conclusions reached by French and Stone JJ in Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 , said that the question of material contribution imposes an evaluative threshold below which a causal connection may be disregarded.

From the findings in Issue 2 above, there is no evidence of attribution or causation which relates to the applicant's employment with Telstra. The medical evidence discloses that that employment could have been an aggravation but the statutory definition requires there to be a "material" contribution. A consideration of that issue is consistent with the provision in s 14(1) of the Act that requires that the evidence of injury "results in"... "incapacity for work". The linkage required is related to "a 'commonsense' evaluation of the causal change, that evaluation being made in the light of the statutory formula itself ( March v EMH Stramare Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 12 ; (1991) 171 CLR 506 ; 99 ALR 423). It was more recently considered by Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 at 542 where His Honour said that the materiality factor must be assessed by an "evaluative threshold below which a causal connection may be disregarded.

His Honour pointed out that by virtue of the definition of "disease" , the employee's employment is now required to contribute "in a material degree" to the suffering or aggravation of a disease. His Honour concluded at [16] that the definition of "disease": 
 
 "(i) requires a stronger causal relationship between the employment and the ailment, etc suffered than that exacted by the 1971 Act; 
 (ii) "in a material degree" requires an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment, etc, in question ( "the threshold evaluation"); 
 (iii) whether this will be so in a given case will be a matter of fact and degree. "

In the analysis of the material before me I am unable to nominate material which would permit me to find that the workplace stress (as opposed to stress arising as a consequence of the disease process and the effects of such, both in the workplace and elsewhere) was either significant or considerable, being adjectives employed in the interpretation of the word "material". </sentence>

<sentence id="cs47" from="[2009] AATA 874">102. For an ailment to be a disease for the purposes of the Act it must be one that was contributed to in a material degree by the employment. The contributing factor must be either some event or occurrence in the course of the employment or, as is relevant in this matter, some characteristic of the workplace: Federal Broom Co Pty Ltd v Semlitch [1964] HCA 34 ; (1964) 110 CLR 626. The concept of "material contribution", particularly with reference to the meaning of the phrase "in a material degree", was further developed in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 ; 44 AAR 523. In that case, Finn J at [12], endorsed the observation in Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 ; 41 AAR 539 at [67] , that the changes brought about by the enactment of the Act "were intended to require that the contribution be 'more than a mere contributing factor'" and that the inclusion of the term "material" imposes an "evaluative threshold below which a causal connection may be disregarded". Finn J concluded at [16] that the correct test for the application of the section 4 definition of "in a material degree" required "an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment" and that whether this will be so, in a given case, "will be a matter of fact and degree". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs48" from="[2009] AATA 871">In either case an ailment will be a "disease" if it was contributed to "in a material degree by the employee's employment. " I accept the submission of the respondent that the definition of "disease" in the Act and, in particular, the inclusion of the word "material" in it means that not every casual connection will be sufficient to satisfy the statutory description of "disease. " Further, that the use of the term "material" serves to emphasise not only that it must be established by evidence that features of the employment did in fact and in truth contribute to the condition complained of but also imposes an evaluative threshold beyond which a causal connection may be disregarded after consideration of all relevant contributing factors: Comcare v Canute ; [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 at [63] - [67], especially at [67]; decision reversed Canute v Comcare [2006] HCA 47 ; (2006) 226 CLR 535 , but not on this point; Comcare v Sahu-Khan (2007) FCA 15 at [11] - [12], [16].

Regard must be had to whether the employment in which the employee was engaged carried an inherent risk of the employee contracting the disease in question and whether some characteristic or feature of the employment tended to cause, aggravate or accelerate the disease: Comcare v Canute at 66. (Whilst Comcare v Canute concerned the interpretation of the provisions of the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 , the provisions under the Act are in material respects the same and reflect the intention of the legislature that the Act be similar to compensation and rehabilitation compensation arrangements applicable to Commonwealth employees and that the definitions in the Act be consistent: House of Representative Explanatory memorandum to the Bill for the Act 36090/92 at p10 Hansard, House of Representatives, 14 October 1992 at p2145). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs49" from="[2009] AATA 848">A question also arises about the meaning of the expression material contribution. Finn J, in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 , said at 542: 
 ... It has not been uncommon for courts, in dealing with statutes requiring such a contribution to be found, to describe that contribution as "material": see eg Repatriation Commission v Bendy [1989] FCA 170 ; (1989) 10 AAR 323 at 325. That usage is not how the term "material" in the phrase "in a material degree" is used in the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs50" from="[2009] AATA 812">The term "in a material degree" is not defined in the Act. Finn J discussed the meaning of the term in Comcare v Sahu-Kahn [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536. Thus, it can be understood that the term "imposes an 'evaluative threshold' below which a causal connection may be disregarded", and "requires an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment. " For an employee to succeed in a claim such as this, it is not necessary to establish that the employment is the central, main or primary factor in the onset or aggravation of the ailment in question. It is sufficient that the employment contributes to the ailment in a material degree. That is a matter of fact and degree to be determined on evaluation of all of the contributing or causal factors. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs51" from="[2009] AATA 808">For the purposes of the Act the contributing factor must be either an event or occurrence in the course of the employment or, as is relevant in this matter, some characteristic of the work performed or the conditions in which it was performed: Federal Broom Co Pty Ltd v Semlitch [1964] HCA 34 ; (1964) 110 CLR 626. What amounts to a "material contribution", was further developed in Comcare v Sahu-Khan (2007) 156 FCR 536 ; [2007] FCA 15 (' Sahu-Khan') , to which we were referred. In that case, Finn J at [12], endorsed the decision in Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 , that the changes brought about by the enactment of the Act "were intended to require that the contribution be 'more than a mere contributing factor'" and that the inclusion of the term "material" imposes an "evaluative threshold below which a causal connection may be disregarded". Finn J concluded at [16] that the correct test for the application of the section 4 definition of "in a material degree" required "an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment" and that whether this will be so, in a given case, "will be a matter of fact and degree". Since that decision the Act has been amended, requiring that the ailment be contributed to, to a significant degree, by the employment. 'Significant degree' is defined to mean 'substantially more than material'. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs52" from="[2009] FCA 1149">The Tribunal then returned to the concept of " material contribution ". At this point in its reasons, it referred to and discussed the judgment of Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536.  In the present case, in order to make good the contention concerning aggravation of an existing ailment which the applicant submits was advanced to the Tribunal, the applicant would need to demonstrate that, at the time he commenced his employment with Centrelink, he was suffering an ailment within the relevant definition and that that ailment was aggravated (ie made more severe) by his employment by Centrelink or that the aggravation was contributed to in a material degree by his employment by Centrelink. The notion of material contribution was explained by Finn J in Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; 156 FCR 536. In that case, his Honour concluded that, in order to assess whether the aggravation of an ailment was contributed to in a material degree by the employee's employment, the Court was obliged to evaluate all relevant contributing factors in order to determine whether the employment made a contribution which was more than a mere contributing factor. His Honour described the exercise as a matter of fact and degree ( Sahu-Khan 156 FCR 536 at [16] (p 542---543)). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs55" from="[2009] AATA 469">Further elaboration of the word "material" in the definition of "disease" in s 4(1) of the Act was made more recently by Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 at 542 [15] . There, His Honour preferred the following interpretation, extracted from the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary : "In a material degree; substantially; considerably". He then noted this was consistent with the definition used in the Macquarie Dictionary and referred to by Davies J in Repatriation Commission v Bendy [1989] FCA 170 ; (1989) 10 AAR 323 at 325: "of substantial import or much consequence [rather than the] legal sense of 'pertinent' or 'likely to influence'". Finn J held at 543 [16] that the Act, by requiring "an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors", imposed a higher test than the antecedent legislation, the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 (something which the amending Act has endeavoured to address). Counsel for the Applicant pointed out that this approach was adopted with approval by Madgwick J in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Comcare [2008] FCA 52.

His Honour pointed out that by virtue of the definition of "disease" , the employee's employment is now required to contribute "in a material degree" to the suffering or aggravation of an ailment. His Honour concluded at [16] that the definition of "disease": 
 "(i) requires a stronger causal relationship between the employment and the ailment, etc suffered than that exacted by the 1971 Act;

Of course, it does not matter that other factors not related to employment contribute to the claimed disease, but what is required by the definition of "disease" in the SRC Act is that the relevant ailment or aggravation must be contributed to by employment "in a material" or "to a significant" degree (depending on whether the asserted ailment or aggravation was suffered before, or on or after, the 2007 amendments to the SRC Act). </sentence>

' 'Ailment' was defined by the same section to mean 'any physical or metal ailment, disorder, defect or morbid condition (whether of sudden onset or gradual development). ' It is not in dispute that the requirement for contribution to a material degree is to be understood as requiring a 'substantial or considerable' degree of work causation: Comcare v Sahu-Kahn [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 per Finn J. 
 It is not in dispute that, as consequence of the transitional provisions in the SRC Act, if the applicant is able to establish his entitlement under the SRC Act applicable at the time of his claim in 2005 to one or more of the three remaining conditions in issue, he would be entitled to compensation: see s 124 of the SRC Act.

For the purposes of finding liability in Comcare, it is necessary only to show some kind of contribution that was not insignificant in order to establish a liability issue. See Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 . The contribution by the employment required under section 4(1) of the Act must be more than a mere contributing factor and an evaluation of all contributing factors. We note there is some medical opinion before us that degenerative osteoarthritis may be a contributing factor but this was not such a contribution as to displace causation due to the injury in the opinion of those who saw Mr Hillier in 1979. As that was the position as far as an injury happening in 1979, it has not become necessary to reprove liability. The respondent has to show that something has happened which takes liability away.

  Following the decision of the Federal Court in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [14] the words "in a material degree" require a stronger causal relationship between the employment and the ailment than was previously thought to be the case. In that matter Finn J said: 
 "in a material degree" requires an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment, etc, in question ...whether this will be so in a given case will be a matter of fact and degree. [15] 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs78" from="[2008] AATA 654">The contributing factor must be either some event or occurrence in the course of the employment or, as is relevant in this matter, some characteristic of the work performed or the conditions in which it was performed: Federal Broom Co Pty Ltd v Semlitch [1964] HCA 34 ; (1964) 110 CLR 626. The concept of "material contribution", particularly with reference to the meaning of the phrase "in a material degree", was further developed in Comcare v Sahu-Khan (2007) 156 FCR 536 ; [2007] FCA 15. In that case, Finn J at [12], endorsed the decision in Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 , that the changes brought about by the enactment of the Act "were intended to require that the contribution be 'more than a mere contributing factor'" and that the inclusion of the term "material" imposes an "evaluative threshold below which a causal connection may be disregarded". Finn J concluded at [16] that the correct test for the application of the section 4 definition of "in a material degree" required "an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment" and that whether this will be so, in a given case, "will be a matter of fact and degree". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs79" from="[2008] AATA 597">Furthermore, although the evidence does support a conclusion that Mr Watts' employment made some contribution to his disease, I find that the contribution was minimal, and that any effects of that contribution were short lived and had ceased.

<sentence id="cs80" from="[2008] AATA 560">In Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 Finn J adopted the conclusions of the majority in Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 on the question of material contribution required for liability in respect of an ailment, and referred to an evaluative threshold below which a causal connection with an ailment may be disregarded.</sentence>

Weigand v Comcare Australia (No 2) [2007] FCA 237. In this decision the Federal Court applied the "more demanding requirement of contribution than had conventionally been considered to be the case''. The Court had applied this requirement in relation to the definition of "disease" in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs82" from="[2008] AATA 1180">
 
 
The Court applied this more demanding requirement in relation to the definition of disease in Comcare v Sahu-Khan (2007) FCA 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs83" from="[2008] AATA 427">We noted Mr Dube's submissions regarding section 7(1) of the Act, and the cases of Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs84" from="[2008] AATA 374">As well, the judgment of Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 significantly elevated the threshold of what is sufficient to constitute a material contribution. We are mindful of the judgment of von Doussa J in the case of Wiegand v Comcare Australia [2002] FCA 1464 ; (2002) 72 ALD 795 , which allows a perception about occurrences during employment to establish sufficient cause for compensation but there still needs to be a finding that some actual events occurred. We are not satisfied that Mr King was in any way persecuted or mistreated or had any reason to perceive he was mistreated at any time. The records before us indicate that, on the contrary, Mr King's superiors went to great lengths to try to assist Mr King and to find activities that suited him in view of his complaints. He also received a great deal of medical attention and care. In any event, we are not persuaded that Mr King suffered a mental injury in any way related to these events but his condition arose many years later. In addition, we are not persuaded that the pain of which Mr King complained in his knees, elbows and wrists amounted to an injury which gave rise to compensation. We further note that the Full Court of the Federal Court found in Kirkpatrick v Commonwealth (1985) 9 FCR 36 , where a person is psychotic or completely delusional and merely their own perceptions cause thoughts that something has happened as opposed to actual events, that is not sufficient to give rise to a connection with employment. The evidence does not justify a finding that Mr King suffered a delusional reaction to a work injury such as was found compensable in Federal Broom Co Pty Ltd v Semlitch [1964] HCA 34 ; (1964) 110 CLR 626. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs85" from="[2008] AATA 298">If activity in employment causes an employee to experience the symptoms of a previously existing injury or condition more severely (in Federal Broom Company Pty Ltd v Semlitch (1964) [24] , Kitto J gave the example of rubbing salt into a wound [25] ), an injury may have occurred even if the increased symptoms are not productive of pathological harm ( Commonwealth v Beattie (1981) [26] ; Commonwealth Banking Corporation v Percival (1988) [27] ). However, any such aggravation will only be within the meaning of 'disease' under the SRC Act if it was contributed to in a material degree by the employment. The phrase 'in a material degree' has no special meaning but imports a threshold below which, on examination of all of the circumstances, a contribution by the employment may be disregarded (see Comcare v Sahu-Kahn [28] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs86" from="[2008] AATA 214">
 Did the Applicant's employment with Centrelink contribute to the condition in a material degree? 
 This is the crux of this case. Employees suffering from a disease have to prove that, having regard to all relevant contributing factors, their employment significantly contributed to the disease: Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15. The contributing factor must be either some event or occurrence in the course of the employment or some characteristic of the work performed or the conditions in which it was performed: Windeyer J in Federal Broom Co Pty Ltd v Semlitch [1964] HCA 34 ; (1964) 110 CLR 626. There was no dispute that some incident involving a co-worker occurred in March 2003. It does not follow, in our view, that the Applicant's work, through aggressive telephone calls and the co-worker incident, materially contributed to his condition. The co-worker incident, in our view, produced only an episodic increase in his pre-morbid stress condition. The concept of "material contribution", particularly with reference to the meaning of the phrase "in a material degree", was further developed in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15. In that case, Finn J at [12], endorsed the decision in Canute v Comcare [2006] HCA 47 ; (2006) 226 CLR 535 , that the changes brought about by the enactment of the Act "were intended to require that the contribution be 'more than a mere contributing factor'" and that the inclusion of the term "material" imposes an "evaluative threshold below which a causal connection may be disregarded". Finn J concluded at [16] that the correct test for the application of the section 4 definition of "in a material degree" required "an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment" and that whether this will be so in a given case "will be a matter of fact and degree".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs87" from="[2008] FCA 52">49 In Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; 156 FCR 536 at [15] - [16], Finn J concluded:
 
 There are, in my view, obvious hazards in allowing finely nuanced differences in dictionary definitions to contrive the answer to this question, given as I have noted, that the word "material" in this context had its legislative meaning set in part by the qualification it imposed on the nature of the contribution required to be demonstrated before the provisions of the SRC Act were engaged. This said I consider that one of the meanings of the word "materially" in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary probably captures the essence of what the legislature was conveying. That meaning is 
 
 "4. In a material degree; substantially, considerably. " 
 
 An example given of this usage is that of contributing "materially to the funds required" for a purpose. This usage probably comes closer to what Davies J in Bendy described (at 325) as the "loose sense" of the definition of "material" in the Macquarie dictionary " namely, 'of substantial import or much consequence' [rather than the] legal sense of 'pertinent' or 'likely to influence '". Bearing in mind that the course of statutory construction is often not aided by substituting for the word used in an enactment, another word which is not so used, probably the best that can ultimately be said is that the s 4 definition: 
 
 
 (i) requires a stronger causal relationship between the employment and the ailment, etc suffered than that exacted by the 1971 Act;
 (ii) "in a material degree" requires an evaluation of all relevant contributing factors for the purpose of asking whether the employee's employment did or did not contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment, etc, in question ("the threshold evaluation");
 (iii) whether this will be so in a given case will be a matter of fact and degree. (Emphasis in original. ) 47 This matter was considered by a majority (French and Stone JJ) of the Full Court of this Court in Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 and by Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536.

It is also agreed that the Tribunal erroneously referred to 'war caused' disease of Mr Robertson in its decision instead of 'defence caused'. Mr Robertson acknowledges that because his PTSD was found to have had its clinical onset in 1994 (after termination of Mr Robertson's defence service), the Tribunal's reference to 'the contribution, to a material degree' adopting the wording of s 9(1)(e) and s 70(5)(d) was irrelevant as the issue raised by these sections is whether an injury or disease was contributed to in a material degree or was aggravated by any eligible war service or defence service respectively rendered after the injury was suffered or the disease was contracted. Mr Robertson refers to Comcare v Sahu-Kahn [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 at [16] and submits that the adoption by the Tribunal of the wording in s 9(1)(e) and s 70(5)(d) required a more onerous test than that required by s 70(5)(a) of the Act which Mr Robertson submits is the section to which the Tribunal should have had regard. Such provision renders an injury 'defence-caused' if it arose out of, or was attributable to, defence service.

In my reasons for my decision to affirm the decision under review I evaluated the relevant evidence by reference to the different test that had been approved in two Federal Court judgments before Canute , and I made no adverse findings as to Mr Wiegand's credibility. In those circumstances, and in accordance with the principles referred to in Industry Research and Development Board v IMT Ltd [2001] FCA 85 and other authorities referred to in that case dealing with the constitution of tribunals where a matter is remitted for rehearing, I had previously seen no difficulty in my constituting the tribunal following the remittal of the matter for rehearing.

<sentence id="cs107" from="[2007] AATA 1365">I am of the view that pain per se is not necessarily an "ailment" within the meaning of that term as part of the definition of "disease" in the SRC Act but, where "proofs are otherwise adequate", a case based upon the occurrence of pain and its cause is allegedly due to working activities, a finding in an applicant's favour may succeed. The wise observations of Deputy President R K Todd in Beer's case (supra) are very pertinent to this (see paras 59 and 60). I am prepared to accept , that pain, in common or general parlance is an "ailment" whether caused by physical or mental stimuli (see also Anderson v Australian Postal Commission (1993)) but for an "ailment" to qualify as a compensable disease under the SRC Act it must be shown to have been contributed to in a material degree by the relevant employment (see Comcare v Sahu Khan [2007] FCA 15 @ para 15 per FinnJ ) or alternatively it must be shown to have been aggravated by the employment. In the present case I have difficulty in concluding that the employment made a causal contribution to the onset of the applicant's pain condition and I have a similar difficulty in finding that, if the pain condition should properly be regarded as caused by or resulting from some non work related condition or event preceding the 18 July 1993, it was aggravated by the work activities of that day or any other time. The concept of aggravation is usefully discussed in Ballard &amp; Sutherlands "Annotated Safety, Rehabilitation &amp; Compensation Act 1988" (6 th Edition @ p28 and following).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs108" from="[2007] AATA 1292">Under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (the Act) Australia Post, as a licensed corporation, is liable to compensate an employee in relation to an injury that causes incapacity for work or impairment (s.14) or requires medical treatment (s.16). 'Injury' is defined to include a physical injury arising out of or in the course of the employment, or a disease that was contributed to in a material degree by the employment, or an aggravation of either such an injury (s.4). The word 'material' imposes an evaluative threshold below which a causal connection may be disregarded [1] , whereby all relevant contributing factors must be evaluated in order to ascertain whether the contribution of the particular employment was material [2] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs109" from="[2007] AATA 1250">There are inconsistent decisions of the Federal Court as to the causal connection that is required between employment and a disease in order for a disease to be compensable under the SRC Act. In two cases decided by single Judges, namely Suters v Australian Postal Corporation (1992) 28 ALD 320 and Wiegand v Comcare Australia [2002] FCA 1464 ; (2002) 72 ALD 795 , the Court applied the approach adopted in an earlier case, namely Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission [1990] FCA 511 ; (1990) 26 FCR 316 , which had been decided under the predecessor of the SRC Act. In Treloar a Full Court of the Federal Court said in effect that the use of the word "material" in other cases in conjunction with the words "contributing factor" (being the expression used in the predecessor legislation) in explaining the relevant section was merely to emphasise that the section was not brought into play unless it was established that the employment did in fact contribute to the condition complained of; and once the causal link was established, it did not matter whether the contribution was large or small. However, in dicta in a much later Full Court decision, namely Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 , French and Stone JJ, who constituted the majority in the Full Court, said in effect that the word "material" in the test of causation in the definition of "disease" in the SRC Act required that the contribution from employment had to be more than a mere contributing factor. The High Court allowed an appeal from the Full Federal Court, but the High Court did not comment on the dicta as to the relevance of the words "to a material degree" in the context of the definition of disease. The views of French and Stone JJ as to this aspect were later adopted by Finn J in Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 and Wiegand v Comcare Australia (No. 2) [2007] FCA 237. </sentence>

'Injury' is defined to mean, inter alia, a disease, being an ailment or the aggravation of an ailment suffered by the employee that was contributed to in a material degree by the employment (s.4). However, a disease suffered by an employee as a result of the employee's failure to obtain a promotion, transfer or benefit in connection with the employment is excluded from 'injury' for the purposes of the Act.
