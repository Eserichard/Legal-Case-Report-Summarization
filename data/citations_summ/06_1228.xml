<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] MRTA 1636">The judgment of Srour v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1228 (Moore J, 15 September 2006) held in relation to the child exception, that an applicant can have a right to custody as an incident of the statutory imposition of parental responsibility by operation of the Family Law Act 1975 in relation to a biological child and a sponsor can have a formal maintenance obligation arising through the operation of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 432">Those provisions have been the subject of consideration by the Federal Court in three decisions being Yazbeck v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 980 ; (2002) 124 FCR 458 at [9] --- [10]; Fitch v Migration Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 1673 ; and Srour v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1228 ; (2006) 155 FCR 441. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] MRTA 342">In addition, the Tribunal notes that arguably the visa applicant also satisfies the requirements of sub-subparagraph 820.221(3)(b)(ii)(A) and (E) at the time of decision. In Srour v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1228 the Court held that an applicant can have a right to custody as an incident of the statutory imposition of parental responsibility by operation of the Family Law Act 1975 in relation to a biological child and that a sponsoring partner can have a formal maintenance obligation, by operation of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 . Consequently, an applicant can meet the requirement in sub-subparagraph 820.221(3)(b)(ii)(A) to have custody of the child and a sponsoring partner can meet the requirement in sub-subparagraph 820.221(3)(b)(i)(E) of having a 'formal maintenance obligation' in respect of the child by virtue of the general law obligations of a biological parent to his/her child, provided there is no Court order granting sole custody to the other parent. Further, in Fitch v MRT [2004] FCA 1673 Dowsett J's obiter comments suggest that 'access' was traditionally used to describe contact arrangements between a non-custodial parent and his or her child and that 'access' in sub- subparagraph 820.221(3)(b)(ii)(A) contemplated some form of continuing access, rather than one previous incident of contact [at 31]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 948">There's a reference to access in paragraph 16, a misdirection in relation to 6, the child of whom both the applicant and its sponsor have access, custody or orders under the Family Law Act , whereas the argument today is quite different. Then 17 deals with custody, not the question of access. A reference to Srour v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1228 ; 155 FCR 441 which deals with the question of custody and then 18 and 19 are different points which don't appear to be pursued today, which is that it's sufficient for the husband and wife to regard the child as a child of the marriage and then that the child regards the father and mother as her parents, and then the foreshadowing of Family Court orders to that effect...The way in which the case was run before the Tribunal...was...on the basis that the parties were in a genuine relationship but had run into difficulties and had separated but were intending to resume...so the case that was being put to the Tribunal is entirely different to the case that is being put to the Court today. The submission today concentrates on the meaning of the word "access" or on the question of access, not the joint custody aspect of the subregulation. The Minister responded to the contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] MRTA 1532">The Tribunal refers to Srour v MIMA [2006] FCA 1228 where Moore J followed the reasoning of Dowsett J in Fitch v Migration Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 1673 and accepted that by operation of the Family Law Act 1975 a person in the applicant's position has custody or joint custody of a biological child without the need for further orders by a Court. Further a person in the sponsor's position has a formal maintenance obligation through the operation of the Family Law Act 1975 and the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 . Moore J noted: 
 
 It may be accepted that this approach would result in the satisfaction of some of the relevant criteria in all circumstances where a visa applicant and the sponsor had a child in respect of whom Australian law operated. If that is an inconvenient or unintended result then the Regulations can be amended (at [57]). 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] MRTA 790">The Tribunal refers to Srour v MIMA [2006] FCA 1228 where Moore J followed the reasoning of Dowsett J in Fitch v Migration Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 1673 and accepted that by operation of the Family Law Act 1975 a person has custody or joint custody of a biological child without the need for further orders by a Court. Further a person in the sponsor's position has a formal maintenance obligation through the operation of the Family Law Act 1975 and the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 . Moore J noted:

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] MRTA 646">The Tribunal refers to Srour v MIMA [2006] FCA 1228 where Moore J followed the reasoning of Dowsett J in Fitch v Migration Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 1673 and accepted that by operation of the Family Law Act 1975 a person in the applicant's position has custody or joint custody of a biological child without the need for further orders by a Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] MRTA 485">That said, the Tribunal understands that in Srour v MIMA [2006] FCA 1228 , the court was satisfied that relevant obligations to a child would be established where a visa applicant and sponsor have a child in respect of whom Australian law (ie the Family Law Act , the Child Support (Assessment) Act , and the common law) operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] MRTA 431">Most recently, Moore J in Srour v MIMIA [2006] FCA 1228 (15 September 2006) took the view that, while the approach of neither Sunberg J (in Yazbeck ) nor Dowsett J (in Fitch) is plainly or clearly wrong, Dowsett J's decision in Fitch, being the more recent, is the judgement on which decision makers would base their decisions and in his view, Dowsett's reasoning is marginally more compelling .</sentence>
