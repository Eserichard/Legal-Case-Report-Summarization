<citphrase id="cp0.0" type=cited from="[2006] FCA 1234">i have inspected the six documents that were said to relate to the iron filings claim. my inspection of awb's documents revealed a further four documents that fall within this category and are still the subject of a privilege claim. i am satisfied that these 10 documents are not privileged, as the documents were brought into existence in furtherance of an improper and dishonest purpose</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 556">Therefore, for example, the privilege that the Office of Film and Literature Classification had over documents brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice regarding the exercise of its statutory powers was equally that of the Commonwealth in all of its emanations. This was the conclusion reached by Edmonds J in New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties Inc v Classification Review Board . [205] 

130. Legal professional privilege may only be abrogated by the clear words of a statute or by necessary implication. [206] There is no suggestion that there has been any statutory abrogation in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 964">In my view when Brennan J referred to 'information' in Kioa he was using it in the same sense as it is used in s 428 and therefore the High Court's reasoning in SZBYR equally applies. A very similar argument to that put by the applicant here was put to Edmonds J in New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties Inc v Classifications Review Board [2006] FCA 1409 ; (2006) 236 ALR 313. One issue was whether the duty to accord procedural fairness precluded the creation of privilege which otherwise attach to documents that were relevant to the judicial review application. Edmonds J was not persuaded. His Honour said, at 318: 
 
 I am not persuaded that some overarching consideration of procedural fairness which, it is alleged, gives rise to an obligation of the review board to disclose the relevant documents to the applicant, a proposition itself attended with considerable doubt, means that privilege in the documents did not arise. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 105">That reference to the letter, Goldberg J concluded, was not " a disclosure of the contents of the advice or a waiver of legal professional privilege ". His Honour, however, formed " a different view in relation to the recommendation where it is explicitly stated that legal advice supporting the respondent's view of Rule No 4 has been received ": [1999] FCA 1770 at [18] . 
 Similarly, it has been recognised that the use of legal advice in a way that contributes to a statutory decision does not itself constitute a waiver of privilege: New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties Inc v Classification Review Board [2006] FCA 1409 at [27] , [2006] FCA 1409 ; 236 ALR 313 at 319. 
 THE PRESENT PROCEEDING -- THE "EXTRA INGREDIENT" 
 
 For the purposes of making a decision pursuant to s 5 of the 1974 Act, the Assistant Treasurer had to form an " opinion " as to whether the overseas conduct was " required or specifically authorised " by a law of the country in which the conduct took place: s 5(5)(a). For the purposes of making that decision, the Assistant Treasurer not surprisingly had before him submissions as to those overseas laws.</sentence>
