<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSCA 114">[108] In State Bank of New South Wales v Chia, [109] Einstein J referred to these observations and then said that:'[t]he test of "unconscionability" correctly identifies ... the underlying principle; or, the equitable grundnorm'.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1448">83 Thirdly, as I have said, I am proceeding on the basis that the applicants have available potential claims against the Receivers under ss 180 and 420A of the Act and on the basis of an equitable duty in favour of the Company. I accept that the equitable duty is as set out in Deangrove Pty Ltd v Buckby [2006] FCA 212 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 630 at [44] where Branson J said:
 
 ... the general law duties of a receiver when exercising a power of sale are analogous to those of a mortgagee (see, for example, Expo International Pty Ltd v Chant [1979] 2 NSWLR 820). As I observed in Gomez v State Bank of NSW Ltd [2001] FCA 1059 at [10] , that duty is a duty to act in good faith, without wilfully or recklessly sacrificing the interests of the mortgagor. The principle underlying the duty is that of 'unconscionability' (Hawkesbury Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Custom Credit Corporation Ltd (1995) NSW Conv R 55-731 per McLelland CJ in Eq.). </sentence>
