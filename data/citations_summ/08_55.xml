<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 544">Nonetheless, I respectfully agree with the views expressed by a number of judges of this Court to the effect that I should proceed with caution when dealing with an application of this kind so as to ensure that Noble is not unjustly shut out from litigating an issue that is fairly arguable: see Boston Commercial at [45] to [46] per Rares J; Unit 11 Pty Ltd v Sharpe Partners Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 43 ; (2006) 150 FCR 405 at [64] per Tamberlin J; Granitgard Pty Ltd v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 55 at [9] per Logan J and Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd (No 2) (2009) 72 ACSR 264; [2009] FCA 567 at [47] per Besanko J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 381">At that stage, a summary judgment application had been heard and was awaiting determination. Granitgard had some scientific advice in respect of what it thought was Termiglass which suggested that its properties were such that it did not provide an effective barrier to subterranean entry notwithstanding what was said in the CSIRO Appraisal. Granitgard disputed that what had been tested was truly what was or what came to be known as Termiglass. As events transpired I dismissed Termicide's summary judgment application early in the month which followed the making of the first offer, Granitgard Pty Ltd ACN 007 427 590 v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd ACN 093 837 337 [2008] FCA 55 but ultimately at trial concluded that Granitgard had not proved that the crushed glass which had been the subject of its then scientific advice was or was what came to be called Termiglass. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 313">Not all of Granitgard's allegations formed part of its case as originally formulated (qv Granitgard Pty Ltd ACN 007 427 590 v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd ACN 093 837 337 [2008] FCA 55). Rather, Granitgard sought to amend its case shortly prior to the originally allocated, June 2008 trial dates. In an application brought on while I was on leave it persuaded another judge, in the circumstances, to grant it leave further to amend its statement of claim and to vacate those trial dates (qv Granitgard Pty Ltd ACN 007 427 590 v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd ACN 093 837 337 [2008] FCA 865 A yet further amendment of Termicide's case was later made after a grant of leave by me in October 2008). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1305">41 The intent of s 31A is to enable summary judgment to be obtained even in circumstances where a consideration of prior authorities such as Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 , which had hitherto informed an assessment on summary judgment of no reasonable prospect of success, might have suggested that an application for summary judgment should be dismissed. In White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 Lindgren J made a number of observations in relation to the changes wrought by s 31A to the determination of a summary judgment application. Many other judges of this Court, including me (q v Granitgard Pty Ltd v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 55) , have gained assistance from those observations. Having regard to those observations, I approach the application made by the Respondents on the basis that a reasonable prospect of success for the purposes of the section is one which is real, not fanciful or merely arguable. So approaching the matter, my opinion is that the substantive application has no reasonable prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1304">23 As to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act , and as her Honour noted, the intent of that section is to enable summary judgment to be obtained even in circumstances where a consideration of prior authorities, such as Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 , which had hitherto informed an assessment on summary judgment of no reasonable prospect of success, might have suggested that an application for summary judgment should be dismissed. Her Honour adopted observations made by Lindgren J in White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 in relation to the changes wrought by s 31A to the determination of a summary judgment application. Many other judges of this Court, including me (q v Granitgard Pty Ltd v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 55) , have gained assistance from those observations. As so informed, her Honour approached the application on the basis that a reasonable prospect of success for the purposes of the section was one which was real, not fanciful or merely arguable. My approach would have been no different.</sentence>
