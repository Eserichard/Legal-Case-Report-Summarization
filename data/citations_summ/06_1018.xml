<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] FCA 1086">In my view in this case the applicant has insufficient prospects of success to warrant granting an extension of time to file a notice of appeal ( WAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399 at par 9 per Lee, Nicholson and Finkelstein JJ, and more recently Conti J in SZFBU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1018 at pars 9-10). Notwithstanding that the delay in filing the notice of appeal was short and it appeared that the respondents experienced no prejudice, in my view the appropriate order is to dismiss the application with costs. 
 ORDER 
 
 1. The application for extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal be dismissed. 2. The applicant pay the costs of the first respondent fixed at the sum of $3500.

 Counsel for the Respondent: S Lloyd
