<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 165">That leaves the issue of Direct Share's application for a declaration that LM Investments contravened s 173 of the Act. The making of a declaration and the terms in which it should be framed are in the Court's discretion: see Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437-9; [1972] HCA 61 ; [1972-73] ALR 1303 at 1313 per Gibbs J; Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 581-2 and 596-7; [1992] HCA 10 ; 106 ALR 11 at 21-2 and 33-4 and AWB Ltd v Cole (No 6) (2006) 235 ALR 307 ; [2006] FCA 1274 at [5] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] NSWCA 6">If the appellant loses on a separate issue argued on the appeal which has increased the time taken in hearing the appeal, then a special order for costs may be appropriate which deprives the appellant of the costs of that issue: Sydney City Council v Geftlick &amp; Ors (No 2) [2006] NSWCA 374 (at [27]). 
 


 
 
 8 Whether an order contrary to the general rule that costs follow the event should be made depends on the circumstances of the case viewed against the wide discretionary powers of the court, which powers should be liberally construed: State of New South Wales v Stanley [2007] NSWCA 330 (at [18]) per Hislop J (with whom Beazley JA and Tobias JJA agreed). 9 ... A separable issue for these purposes can relate to 'any disputed question of fact or law' before a court on which a party fails, notwithstanding that they are otherwise successful in terms of the ultimate outcome of the matter: James and Ors v Surf Road Nominees Pty Ltd and Ors [No 2] [2005] NSWCA 296 (at [34]) ..." 
 


 
 I would add to those observations a reference to Young J's remarks in AWB Ltd v Cole (No 6) [2006] FCA 1274 ; (2006) 235 ALR 307 which usefully collect a number of authorities: 


 
 
 "[12] AWB submitted that the circumstances do not warrant any departure from the usual approach that an applicant who achieves substantial success should have the costs of the proceedings. AWB relied in particular on the following passage from Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 (' Cretazzo' ) where Jacobs J said at 16: 
 


 
 
 
 'But trials occur daily in which the party, who in the end is wholly or substantially successful, nevertheless fails along the way on particular issues of fact or law. The ultimate ends of justice may not be served if a party is dissuaded by the risk of costs from canvassing all issues, however doubtful, which might be material to the decision of the case.

89 Although the making of a declaration and the terms in which it should be framed are in the Court's discretion (see Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437---9 per Gibbs J; and Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 581---2 and 596---7; AWB Ltd v Cole (No 6) ( [2006] FCA 1274 ; 2006) 235 ALR 307 at [5] ), any declaration made by the Court should reflect the final outcome of the case with certainty and precision: see also Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo Wei Rong (1997) 191 CLR 559 (at 579) citing University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1975) 133 CLR 1 ; Bass v Permanent Trustee Company Limited [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 198 CLR 334 at [49] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Danoz Direct Pty Ltd (2003) 60 IPR 296 at [260] and K Dharmananda and A Papamatheos (eds), Perspectives on Declaratory Relief (2009) at 101. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 332">Pursuant to s 43 of the Court Act, the Court has an unfettered general discretion in respect of the award of costs, provided that such discretion is exercised judicially: see Ruddock and Others v Vardarlis and Others (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229 at [9]. The general rule is that costs follow the event: see Ruddock at [11]. In AWB Ltd v Honourable Terrance Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 6) [2006] FCA 1274 , Young J, at [16]-[17], ordered each party to pay their own costs, given that each had achieved a ' substantial measure of success '. His Honour could not find that either party could be considered the ' successful litigant '. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1826">29 I consider the matter to fall within the principles enunciated by Young J in AWB Ltd v Cole (No 6) [2006] FCA 1274 ; (2006) 235 ALR 307 at [10] - [17] where His Honour said:
 
 ' [10] AWB sought an order that the respondents pay its costs of the proceedings, including any reserved costs. It argued that the applicant was the successful litigant in material respects. It submitted that, subject to the court's findings concerning waiver and the fraud exception, it had successfully proven that privilege prima facie attached to all but 25 of the documents over which it pressed its claim.</sentence>
