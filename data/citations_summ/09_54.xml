<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1305">Finally, there is the question of how to assess, if necessary, whether a particular representation is "likely" to mislead or deceive a representative member of the relevant class. In Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union [1979] FCA 85 ; (1979) 42 FLR 331 ; 27 ALR 367 (at 346-348; 381-382) (" Tillmanns Butcheries ") Deane J rejected the argument that the word "likely" in s 45D of the Act means "probably". Part of his Honour's reasoning was that, used in that sense, it would add little if anything to the task of a court required to assess, on the balance of probabilities, whether conduct "would have" a particular result. That reasoning was accepted as applying to s 52 of the Act in Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82. There, a Full Court held (at 87) that conduct is likely to mislead or deceive if that is a "real or not remote chance or possibility regardless of whether it is less or more than fifty per cent". The proposition was supported by reference to the judgment of Deane J in Tillmanns Butcheries which had, a short time earlier, been approved by the High Court in Sheen v Fields Pty Ltd (1984) 58 ALJR 93 ; 51 ALR 345 (see also Foxtel Management Pty Ltd v Australian Video Retailers Association Ltd [2004] FCA 1613 ; (2004) 214 ALR 554 at [76] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Harris Scarfe Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 54 (" ACCC v Harris Scarfe ") at [47]).

 "Where printed advertising is under consideration, it is appropriate to consider not simply the words or images depicted but also their relative emphasis (whether by print size, location, colour or other manner of presentation) to determine whether the asserted representation has been made in its overall context. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 433">On 5 February 2009, I gave judgment in this matter: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Harris Scarfe Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 54 (the primary judgment). I made certain declaratory and injunctive orders, and reserved for the parties the question of costs. I have now heard submissions on the question of costs. These reasons follow from, and should be read with, the primary judgment. I do not propose to repeat what is said there. </sentence>
