<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1037">5 Buchanan J dismissed an appeal to this court: SZJBW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 916 at [9] saying that the tribunal had systematically rejected the applicant's claims and found that he had been untruthful and had invented his claims to assist his application. He noted that it was not the function of the Federal Magistrates Court or this court to make an assessment on the merits of claims of visas and said no error had been identified in the judgment of Emmett FM and no jurisdictional error had been shown to him on appeal in respect of the decision of the tribunal.</sentence>
