 [1] This judgment concerns the costs of the proceedings which were determined by my judgment on 23 February 2011. The argument cites Degmam Pty Ltd (in liq) v Wright (No 2); [4] Barrett Property Group Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [5] and Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd [6] where Sheppard J said that the categories of case for which indemnity costs could be appropriate included where allegations were made which ought never to have been made or the case was unduly prolonged by groundless contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 866">The preferred course, it is concluded, is to order that Mr Pantzer should be entitled to an order for costs --- but only a percentage of his overall costs. Any assessment of that percentage is necessarily lacking in any mathematical precision: cf. Dias Aluminium Products Pty Ltd v Ullrich Aluminium Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1400 at [7] , [2005] FCA 1400 ; 225 ALR 569 at 570 per Crennan J; Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd (No 2) [2010] FCA 277 at [4] per Jacobson J. To " a considerable extent matters of impression and judgment " are involved: Barrett Property Group Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 at [19] per Gilmour J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] TASSC 103">I am told that the defendants will seek to have that re-listed for argument as to costs. All of this raises the possibility of at least more than one taxation were I to make the order the plaintiffs seek. Multiple taxations are to be avoided; Bull Nominees (above) and Barrett Property Group Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 at [33] . Lastly, the plaintiffs did not claim any financial detriment were they forced to await the final determination of the action for enforcing the order to be made in their favour. 39 Having regard to those matters, the plaintiffs have not satisfied me on the material that there is sufficient justification to depart from the usual order.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] NSWCA 191">16 By cl 13.11, the break fees were not payable if a court or the Takeovers Panel determined, in substance, that there would thereby be illegality or breach of duty or the break fee was unenforceable. A Federal Court challenge to the Deed so far as providing for payment by Symbion of a break fee, mounted by Primary as 20 per cent shareholder (through a subsidiary) on the ground amongst others of breach of directors' duties, did not succeed: Idameneo (No 123) Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Ltd [2007] FCA 1823 ; (2007) 165 FCR 19. It was not in contest in the present case that cl 13.9()(iii) should be given effect according to its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] NSWCA 161">97 There are illustrations in the cases of the approach in principle to which I have referred. In Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd the indemnity costs were only those incurred after a particular date, because (at 400) it was only from that date that the proceedings had no possibility of success. In Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd the indemnity costs were confined to those of one issue, the issue concerning the use of inverted jars in testing flowability, being (at 261) the issue which unduly prolonged the proceedings and made them more complex. In Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineering Pty Ltd v Gordian Runoff Ltd [2006] NSWCA 583 Einstein J found unreasonableness in litigation of issues relating to compaction and made an order for 20 per cent of the costs on an indemnity basis, the percentage being "assessed by reference to the whole spectrum of the evidence considered against the compaction issues litigated" (at [63]). As a recent illustration, in Barrett Property Group Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 Gilmour J ordered indemnity costs "in respect to preparation for and the conduct of the trial, going to the issue of derivation of the accused plans and homes and whether or not there was actual copying of the Copyright Works" (at [18]), and assessed the extent of the costs going to that issue at 50 per cent of the preparation for trial and for the trial itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1621">30 In Barrett Property Group Limited v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 (" Barrett "), Gilmour J discussed the circumstances in which departure from the general rule in Order 62 rule 3(3) may be justified: see Barrett at [23]-[24] and the authorities there discussed and cited. It is unnecessary to repeat his Honour's discussion here. Having regard to the relevant authorities, including Barrett , I would not grant leave to tax costs forthwith in this case, at least not now. I accept that Mr Sobey has led the Commissioner to incur costs over and above what he would have incurred had Mr Sobey conducted his case diligently. The issues in this case are not complex, however, and I would not expect the trial to be especially lengthy or complex. The parties ought to be ready for a trial, at the latest, by early next year. This ought not to be a case in which the Commissioner waits unduly long to recover any costs due on taxation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1375">

31 Other cases decided recently in this Court show that these principles are regularly applied: see, e.g., Barrett Property Group Limited v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 (" Barrett ") at [3]-[5] per Gilmour J; Xat Ky v Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd (No 2 ) [2007] FCA 1785 at [12] - [13], [29] per Middleton J; Access for All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] per Collier J; Jainshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 per Besanko J; and Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] - [5] per Finn J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 629">3 As indemnity costs are sought in a number of the proposed orders it will be convenient, before turning to the circumstances in which the various costs orders are sought, to outline the principles which govern the determination of applications for the award of indemnity costs. These principles are, conveniently, drawn together in the recent judgment of Gilmour J in Barrett Property Group Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 at [3] and [4]. His Honour there said:
 "An award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge except as provided by any other Act: Federal Court of Australia Act s 43(2). The discretion must be exercised judicially.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCAFC 46">27 In considering the merit of the above submissions it is necessary to turn to the findings of fact made by the primary judge. Those findings of fact are to be understood against the background that his Honour rejected the evidence given by the witnesses called by the Metricon Parties concerning the history of the Prada design. Indeed, his Honour formed the view that on the issues of derivation and copying, the four key witnesses called by the Metricon Parties made a concerted effort to present a false defence (see Barrett Property Group Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 at [13] and [16]).</sentence>
