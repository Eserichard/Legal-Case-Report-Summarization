<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 343">The applicant appealed to the Federal Court of Australia on 3 July 2006. On 13 November 2006 Madgwick J dismissed the appeal (see SZHMM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1541). It is apparent that his Honour considered carefully the claims of the applicant in relation to alleged jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. Indeed Madgwick J expressed concern about the operation of s.422B of the Migration Act in circumstances such as those that were before him (at [3] --- [6]). Nonetheless his Honour found that the appeal must fail. </sentence>
