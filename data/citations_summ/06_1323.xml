<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 967">In Meinhardt (Hong Kong) Ltd v William Lindsay Meinhardt (Deceased) &amp; Ors (No.2) [2006] FCA 1323 in granting an order for the administration of the deceased estate Jessup J at [56] commented: If, under an administration pursuant to Pt XI of the Bankruptcy Act , the debts of the estate cannot be paid in full, there will be no assets for distribution amongst the beneficiaries under the Mr Meinhardt's will; it could hardly then be claimed that there was any particular advantage in an administration pursuant to the Administration and Probate Act . If on the other hand, during a Pt XI administration it transpires that all debts of the estate can be paid in full, and those debts are paid in full, the order under s244 would thereupon be annulled by the operation of s252 of the Bankruptcy Act . The remaining assets is the estate would then be distributed according to the will of the testator and the requirements of the Administration and Probate Act . Although it may be thought that there is a certain inconvenience in such a possible two-stage process, it would at least be, in my view, a fair and appropriate one, in that the rights of creditors would first be protected under the Bankruptcy Act and, if the situation arises, the rights of beneficiaries would then be advanced under the Administration and Probate Act . </sentence>
