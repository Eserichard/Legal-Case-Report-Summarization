<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] RRTA 1162">The courts have gone further to distinguish where the law of general application may not be appropriate to consideration of whether there is a real chance of discriminatory treatment for a Convention ground in relation to conscientious objectors to compulsory military service. In the Federal Court decision in SZMFJ v MIAC [2009] FCA 95 , which follows the line of judicial authority in Erduran v MIAC [2002] FCA 814 ; (2002) 122 FCR 150 , it was found that non-discriminatory application of a general law to a conscientious objector may itself constitute persecution for a Convention reason. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] RRTA 506">Enforcement of a generally applicable law does not ordinarily constitute persecution for the purposes of the Convention, because enforcement of such a law does not ordinarily involve discrimination. However, in Erduran, Merkel J at [28], referring to Wang v MIMA [2000] FCA 1599 ; (2000) 105 FCR 548 at [65] , stated that "even if a law is a law of general application, its impact on a person who possesses a Convention-related attribute can result in a real chance of persecution for a Convention reason. " The judgement in Erduran was subsequently set aside on appeal. However, in allowing the Minister's appeal, the Full Federal Court did not directly deal with his Honour's discussion of Convention nexus: MIMA v VFAI of 2002 [2002] FCAFC 374 (Black CJ, North &amp; Merkel JJ, 25 November 2002). The 'test' in Erduran has been followed in many cases involving conscription laws, including a recent case in 2009 ( SZMFJ v MIAC [2009] FCA 95). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 55">I have considered authorities concerning the application of the Convention definition of a refugee in relation to conscientious objectors to military service. In particular, relevant principles were discussed in the judgment of Gray J in Erduran v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 814 ; (2002) 122 FCR 150 at [28] , which was recently cited by Jagot J in SZMFJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 95 at [4]. Gray J explained that the starting point is a finding that the applicant, in fact, has conscientious objections to compulsory military service. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1246">The applicant referred to the first instance decision of Gray J in Erduran v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 814 ; (2002) 122 FCR 150 and to the decision of Jagot J in SZMFJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (No.2) [2009] FCA 95 from which can be derived the principle that, depending on the particular facts found, the non-discriminatory application of a general law may constitute persecution for a reason within the scope of the Convention. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 1283">Counsel for the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Ms Sirtes, has drafted a written outline of submissions which was filed at the Court on 18 th November 2009. In her submissions to the Court, she largely relied on the written submissions, although took the Court to the decision of SZMFJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No.2) [12] , and submitted that the decision in SZMFJ should be distinguished from the matter under review on the facts. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 771">On appeal the Federal Court ultimately set aside the orders of the Federal Magistrate, set aside the Tribunal's decision, and remitted the matter to the Tribunal for determination according to law. (See SZMFJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No.2) [2009] FCA 95 --- " SZMFJ (No.2) (FC)") </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 399">That is consistent with the reasoning of her Honour Jagot J in SZMFJ v Minister for Immigration (No 2) [2009] FCA 95 at [10] . It is an error to assume that the enforcement of a non discriminatory law of general application is incapable of constituting persecution for any reason within the scope of the Convention. </sentence>
