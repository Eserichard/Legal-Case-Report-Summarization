18 It is essential, if these provisions are to operate appropriately, that any defendant be required to plead the proportionate liability defence in a manner that discloses the cause of action and damage in at least as detailed a manner as would be required of any initiating process for such a cause of action. The information should include: 
 
 
 
 

(a) the identity of the concurrent wrongdoer;
 

 
(b) the basis for the cause of action --- if it be contract, identify the contract; if it be tort, identifying the duty, its scope and the breach; and
 

 
(c) the damage --- the aspects of causation; the alleged extent and proportion of the damages, and the causal connection with the damage said to be suffered by the plaintiff in the substantive proceedings. 
 
 
 

In this regard, I agree, with great respect, with the view expressed by McDougall J in his paper "Proportionate Liability in Construction Litigation" (2006) 22 BCL 394 at 400; see also UCAK v Avante Developments [2007] NSWSC 367 (per Hammerschlag J) and Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 ; (2007) 164 FCR 450 (per Middleton J).

 As the respondents observed, in drafting the provisions of Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act , the legislature deliberately chose to define "apportionable claim" by reference to an action for damages arising from a failure to take reasonable care. The provisions do not require that the claim itself be a claim in negligence or for a breach of duty --- it only requires that the claim arise from a failure to take reasonable care. 
 
 9 Similarly, in Suncorp Metway Pty Ltd v Panagiotidis [2009] VSC 126 , Associate Justice Evans said: 
 
 
 "20. In Solak v Bank of Western Australia , [1] Pagone J expressed his opinion (obiter) as to the proper approach in determining whether or not a proceeding relates to an apportionable claim under Part IV AA and similar regimes as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 'the factual precondition to the operation of the relevant statutory regimes does not depend upon how a claim is pleaded but whether the statutory precondition exists, namely whether the claim arises from a failure to take reasonable care. In Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 ; ((2007) [2007] FCA 1216 ; 164 FCR 450) Middleton J said that the words arising from the failure to take reasonable care should be interpreted broadly (ibid) [29]. In my view the State regimes providing for the apportionment of liability between concurrent wrongdoers require a broad interpretation of the condition upon which the apportionment provision depends to enable courts to determine how the claim should be apportioned between those found responsible for the damage. The policy in the legislation is to ensure that those in fact who caused the actionable loss are required to bear the portion of the loss referable to their cause. That task ought not to be frustrated by arid disputes about pleadings. '" </sentence>

File No 686/2008

  37 In Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 ; (2007) 164 FCR 450 , Middleton J held that a claim that is not based on a breach of a duty to take reasonable care can still be held to arise from a failure to take reasonable care, for the purposes of the Victorian equivalent of our s43A(1)(a). At 458, his Honour said the following:
 
 
 "Where a claim brought by an applicant does not have as one of its necessary elements any allegation of failing to take reasonable care, an additional enquiry into the failure to take reasonable care may become relevant in the course of a trial to determine the application of Pt IVAA. Even though the claims in this proceeding themselves do not rely upon any plea of negligence or a 'failure to take reasonable care' in a strict sense, a failure to take reasonable care may form part of the allegations or the evidence that is tendered in the proceedings. At the end of the trial, after hearing all the evidence, it may be found that Pt IVAA applies. In these circumstances, where a respondent desires to rely upon Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act , it will need to plead and prove each of the statutory elements, including the failure to take reasonable care. ... If a respondent calls in aid the benefit of the limitation on liability provided for in Pt IVAA of the Wrongs Act , then the respondent has the onus of pleading and proving the required elements. The court, after hearing all the evidence, will then need to determine, as a matter of fact, whether the relevant claim brought by the applicant is a claim arising from a failure to take reasonable care. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] NSWSC 954">18 It is essential, if these provisions are to operate appropriately, that any defendant be required to plead the proportionate liability defence in a manner that discloses the cause of action and damage in at least as detailed a manner as would be required of any initiating process for such a cause of action. The information should include:
 

 
(a) the identity of the concurrent wrongdoer;
 

 
(b) the basis for the cause of action --- if it be contract, identify the contract; if it be tort, identifying the duty, its scope and the breach; and
 

 
(c) the damage --- the aspects of causation; the alleged extent and proportion of the damages, and the causal connection with the damage said to be suffered by the plaintiff in the substantive proceedings. In this regard, I agree, with great respect, with the view expressed by McDougall J in his paper "Proportionate Liability in Construction Litigation" (2006) 22 BCL 394 at 400; see also UCAK v Avante Developments [2007] NSWSC 367 (per Hammerschlag J) and Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 ; (2007) 164 FCR 450 (per Middleton J). </sentence>

 Question 7 
 
 49 Counsel for the third and seventh defendants did not contend that Part IVAA of the Wrongs Act applied to any of the Federal claims. And by email sent to my Associate before the hearing, the fourth defendant confirmed that the reference in para 143 of his defence to the "Reasonable Care Claims" being subject to Part IVAA of the Wrongs Act was "to be construed as limited to Reasonable Care Claims arising from a claimed contravention of the FTA". Subject to that, he agreed with the plaintiff's submission as to question 7, which was to the effect that Part IVAA of the Wrongs Act could not apply to the Federal claims because, for the purpose of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1901 (Cth), the law of the Commonwealth (in the form of the Federal proportionate liability legislation) had "otherwise provided"; see Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [42] . I agree with the plaintiff's submission. Accordingly, the answer to parts (b) and (c) of question 7 is "no". 35 More generally, counsel submitted that the question of when a cause of action accrues under misleading or deceptive conduct provisions is a very "fact-sensitive matter", and because in the present case there were a vast range of possible combinations by which a particular cause of action may accrue at any point prior to September 2004, there was an insufficient factual foundation, even on the basis of the assumptions contained in the questions, to enable the Court to provide any meaningful answer to the preliminary questions at this point. In further support of this submission as to the lack of utility in answering the questions, counsel contended that the claims under s 11 of the FTA may or may not be apportionable claims, depending on the facts ultimately found at trial. He referred to the decision of Middleton J in Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [37] . Counsel submitted that, in circumstances where the plaintiff's claims under s 11 of the FTA specifically plead an absence of reasonable grounds by the defendants and where the third and seventh defendants' defence pleads that in relation to the Prospectus claims they acted reasonably in relying on various matters, if the plaintiff succeeds at trial on this claim, it may support a finding that the claims under s 11 of the FTA arose from a failure to take reasonable care, such that Part IVAA would apply. However, that would not be known until after trial when relevant factual findings had been made.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] VCAT 464">Applications for joinder for the purposes of Part IVAA have their own peculiarities. The observations of Middleton J in Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 (10 August 2007) are pertinent. Whilst finding that Part IVAA did not apply to the particular circumstances of that case, she made the following observations about its operation: ... Where a claim brought by an applicant does not have as one of its necessary elements any allegation of failing to take reasonable care, an additional enquiry into the failure to take reasonable care may become relevant in the course of a trial to determine the application of Pt IVAA. Even though the claims in this proceeding themselves do not rely upon any plea of negligence or a "failure to take reasonable care" in a strict sense, a failure to take reasonable care may form part of the allegations or the evidence that is tendered in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] FCAFC 39">4 In the present case, two causes of action are relied upon. One is a contractual claim and the other is under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). Focusing for the present on the latter claim, it is a claim for damages under s 82 which has been described as a statutory cause of action: see, for example, the observations in the joint judgment in Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 525. As Middleton J correctly said in Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 ; (2007) 164 FCR 450 at [97] and [101], if the cause of action is based on alleged misleading or deceptive conduct arising from misrepresentations, there must be some evidence showing the loss or damage arising out of the alleged misleading statements to found an order for preliminary discovery.

 The issue 
 Quite apart from their daytime jobs, Luke and Roslyn Netherton were kept busy managing a health service principally for mining companies around the remote Olympic Dam area where they live. They conceived the idea of acquiring a mobile health unit, fitted to the rear of a truck or trailer. Moreover, as Mr Keen pointed out during his countering submissions, the position contended for by the defendant conflicts with the Rules of Court paraphrased above and with long-standing principle established by the case law. The defendants' stance also conflicts with the decision of Hammerschlag J in Ucak v Avante Developments [108] on identical legislation which his Honour described as furnishing a defence which must be pleaded. His decision was applied by Judd J in P &amp; V Industries Pty Ltd (formerly Porto &amp; Valente Industries Pty Ltd) as trustee for Porto &amp; Valente Unit Trust v Secombs (a firm), [109] by Middleton J in Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [110] and by Rothman J in HSD Co Pty Ltd v Masu Financial Management Pty Ltd [111] in relation to analogous legislation: and see McDougall "Proportionate Liability in Construction Litigation". [112] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2009] VSC 82">However, the apportionability of claims under the State legislation all depend fundamentally upon whether the claim is one "arising from a failure to take reasonable care". Bank West's claim against the third parties is not pleaded as such but the factual pre-condition to the operation of the relevant statutory regimes does not depend upon how a claim is pleaded but whether the statutory precondition exists, namely whether the claim arises from a failure to take reasonable care. In Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [35] Middleton J said that the words "arising from a failure to take reasonable care" should be interpreted broadly. [36] In my view the State regimes providing for apportionment of liability between concurrent wrongdoers requires a broad interpretation of the condition upon which apportionment provision depends to enable courts to determine how the claim should be apportioned between those found responsible for the damage. The policy in the legislation is to ensure that those in fact who caused the actionable loss are required to bear the portion of the loss referable to their cause.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2009] TASSC 15">23 The question cannot involve as broad a principle as was suggested in argument, even accepting a degree of illustrative hyperbole. The Act, s43A(1)(a), explicitly states that an apportionable claim includes a claim for economic loss in an action for damages in contract . (In the Act, s3, "damages" is defined as monetary compensation, which expression it seems, includes a sum certain; Dartberg v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 ; (2007) 164 FCR 450 at 456 [17] . ) The Act, s3A permits contracting parties to expressly regulate the operation of the legislation as between them. Ordinarily, the question of whether a claim is an "apportionable claim" in any particular case is, of course, to be determined by an analysis of the nature of the claim made to see whether it is one "for economic loss in an action for damages". Whether a party is a "concurrent wrongdoer" within the meaning of s34A(2) involves the resolution of several questions of fact and law. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2009] FCA 87">In ascertaining whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the necessary elements exist for a cause of action, the Court must determine that there is at least a reasonable cause 'to believe that each of the elements of the relevant cause of action might be established' : see Middleton J in Dartberg Pty Limited v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd and Another [2007] FCA 1216 ; (2007) 164 FCR 450 at [44] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2009] VSC 7">44 In the present case, ground (b) of Wealthcare's originating motion ascribes error to FICS as follows: 
 
 "wrongly concluding that the decision of the Federal Court of Australia in Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 required the conclusion that in this case Wealthcare could not reduce the Claimant's entitlement to compensation on the basis of proportionate liability. "  I infer that the panel relied on both provisions (as well as on s 851(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 in respect of the earlier conduct). Had the Norrises brought a claim against Wealthcare in the Federal Court under s 851(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 and/or under ss 945A and 953B of that Act, that claim could not have been met by any valid plea under the Part IVAA of the Wrongs Act . So much follows from the reasoning of Middleton J on certain points raised in Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [54] . I am in respectful general agreement with his Honour's reasoning. The applicant in Dartberg relied on four sets of Commonwealth statutory provisions (referred to in the judgment as "the Commonwealth Legislation"), including s 851(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 . 27 In the present case, as I have said, Wealthcare concedes that neither Part IVAA of the Wrongs Act nor any other statutory provisions imposing proportionate liability applied, of their own force, to the complaint before the panel. In those circumstances I can see nothing in rule 5 of the FICS rules to elevate the so-called "norm" of proportionate liability to an "applicable legal rule" that the panel was obliged to put into effect in this case. Arguably, perhaps, the panel might have chosen, in the exercise of its broad discretion, to discount the Norrises' compensation by reference to some sort of analogy with the principles of proportionate liability as reflected in Part IVAA of the Wrongs Act . But Wealthcare's submissions to the Panel were not couched in that way, even in the alternative. Nor, in fairness, does Wealthcare now seek to attack the panel's decision as involving any such miscarriage of its discretion. Wealthcare continues to put its case on an "all or nothing" basis. In any event, as I will explain in due course by reference to Dartberg Pty ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [38] it is arguable that for the panel to have reduced the Norrises' compensation by reference to some analogy with proportionate liability would have been precluded by rule 5 as being contrary to a particular "legal rule" established in Dartberg, namely that the provisions of Part IVAA cannot be used, at least in the Federal Court, in defence of a claim under s 945A and s 953B of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2008] FCA 1912">25 The respondents claim that they have not breached the alleged duty of care that they may have owed to the TCF and rely upon the decision in Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd and Another [2007] FCA 1216 ; (2007) 164 FCR 450. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] NSWSC 1279">18 It is essential, if these provisions are to operate appropriately, that any defendant be required to plead the proportionate liability defence in a manner that discloses the cause of action and damage in at least as detailed a manner as would be required of any initiating process for such a cause of action. The information should include:
 

 
(a) the identity of the concurrent wrongdoer;
 

 
 
 (b) the basis for the cause of action --- if it be contract, identify the contract; if it be tort, identifying the duty, its scope and the breach; and 
 


 
 
 (c) the damage --- the aspects of causation; the alleged extent and proportion of the damages, and the causal connection with the damage said to be suffered by the plaintiff in the substantive proceedings. 
 


In this regard, I agree, with great respect, with the view expressed by McDougall J in his paper "Proportionate Liability in Construction Litigation" (2006) 22 BCL 394 at 400; see also UCAK v Avante Developments [2007] NSWSC 367 (per Hammerschlag J) and Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 ; (2007) 164 FCR 450 (per Middleton J).

<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] FCA 1656">8 The proportionate liability regime in the Wrongs Act may apply to an action in the Federal Court by reason of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) so long as commonwealth law does not "otherwise provide". This was decided in Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 ; (2007) 164 FCR 450 , 457 although Middleton J assumed that the proportionate liability regime was a matter of "procedure" for the purposes of s 79 , a point which may be controversial: see John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson [2000] HCA 36 ; (2000) 203 CLR 503. Assuming that the provisions are procedural in nature, they would not apply to a claim for relief under s 87 of the Trade Practices Act for a contravention of s 52 because, by necessary implication, Part VIA has otherwise provided. Separately from s 79 , the proportionate liability regime in the Wrongs Act would apply to BHPB's common law claim for negligent misstatement to ensure resolution of the whole matter: Phillip Morris Inc v Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd (1981) 148 CLR 457 , 475. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs27" from="[2008] FCA 1527">Accordingly, an applicant for preliminary discovery may be entitled to discovery in order to determine what defences are available to the respondent and the possible strength of those defendants, or to determine the extent of the respondent's breach and the likely quantum of any damages award ...;
 
 (g) whether an applicant has "sufficient information" for the purposes of subpara (b) also requires an objective assessment to be made ... The subparagraph contemplates that the applicant is lacking a piece (or pieces) of information reasonably necessary to decide whether to commence proceedings;
 
 (h) it is no answer to an application under the rule to say that the proceeding is in the nature of a "fishing expedition" ... Indeed order 15A r 6 "expressly contemplates" what once might have been castigated as "fishing" ..."

<sentence id="cs28" from="[2008] FCAFC 133">48 It was not incumbent upon Optiver to establish every element of the relevant causes of action, but a reasonable cause to believe that it "has or may have" the right to relief alleged. Of course, this is not to say that it is not necessary to examine the various elements of the potential cause of action that is sought to be relied upon to determine whether there is a reasonable cause to believe that each of the necessary elements exist (see Austrac Operations Pty Ltd v State of New South Wales [2003] FCA 1013 ; (2003) ATPR 41-960 at [11] ; Leighton Contractors Pty Limited (ABN 98 000 893 667) v Page Kirkland Management Pty Limited (ABN 46 097 111 245) [2006] FCA 288 at [5] ; Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 ; (2007) 164 FCR 450 at [44] ). Nor can an application for preliminary discovery be sustained without evidence that must incline the mind towards the matter of fact in question (see Austrac at [37]; John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 679 at [13] ---[14], [17], [73]; Dartberg at [44]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2008] VCAT 851">It might be said that if it wants the benefit of that party being joined to the proceeding it should plead out its case, but that seems to me to be grossly unfair in relation to a situation it finds itself in because of legislation which is there for the benefit of respondents. Let the respondent who wishes to minimise its potential liability incur the costs of pleading and proving the case against the joined respondents. I am fortified in my view by the observations of Middleton J in Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 (10 August 2007) who, whilst finding that Part IVAA did not apply to the particular circumstances of that case made the following observations about its operation: ... Where a claim brought by an applicant does not have as one of its necessary elements any allegation of failing to take reasonable care, an additional enquiry into the failure to take reasonable care may become relevant in the course of a trial to determine the application of Pt IVAA. Even though the claims in this proceeding themselves do not rely upon any plea of negligence or a "failure to take reasonable care" in a strict sense, a failure to take reasonable care may form part of the allegations or the evidence that is tendered in the proceedings. At the end of the trial, after hearing all the evidence, it may be found that Pt IVAA applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs30" from="[2008] WASC 51">83 There are two further points about the present element that have been referred to in the authorities on the Federal Court Rule O 15A r 6 and that both parties appeared to accept for the purposes of this application. These I can conveniently take from the most recent authority on that rule cited to me, Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 , which refers to, among other authorities, Harris v Newcastle-upon-Tyne Health Authority [1989] 2 All ER 273 , 277 on a corresponding rule of the High Court, to which I will have cause to return.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs31" from="[2008] NSWSC 187">23 This approach accords with that taken by Middleton J to analogous legislation of Victoria (Part IVAA of the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic)) in Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216. After referring to the need for facts warranting apportionment to be put forward by a defendant at an early stage, his Honour said (at [31]):
 

 
 
 "The court, after hearing all the evidence, will then need to determine, as a matter of fact, whether the relevant claim brought by the applicant is a claim arising from a failure to take reasonable care. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs32" from="[2007] FCA 1731">20 In St George Bank Hely J emphasised that the bare possibility that something may have occurred is insufficient to satisfy the test in rule 6(a) that there is reasonable cause to believe that an applicant may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from another person. Whilst an applicant does not need to go so far as to establish a prima facie case, it does have to establish that there is reasonable cause to believe that each of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists. The evidence must incline the mind to the view that each necessary element exists. Whilst the threshold test under paragraph (a) of rule 6 is set at quite a low level, it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility that an applicant may have a claim when that claim is completely dependent on as yet unknown facts. Unsupported speculation will not suffice (per Hely J in St George Bank at [29] and [32]). Mere assertion, conjecture or suspicion is insufficient to establish reasonable cause to believe that an applicant may have a right to obtain relief in the Court from another person. Reliance upon suspicion or a 'hunch' will not suffice (per Middleton J in Dartberg Pty Ltd v Wealthcare Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1216 at [76] and [81]).</sentence>
