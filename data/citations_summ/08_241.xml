<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 802">These complaints related to information in the delegate's decision. Mr Dobbie conceded that, on the authority of Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Chamnam You [2008] FCA 241 (at [16]), information contained in a delegate's decision record is information given by the applicant to the Tribunal if and when an applicant gives that decision record to the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 369">It was submitted for the first respondent that while evidence of the certification may be information within s.359A(1) of the Act, in this case the exception in s.359A(4)(b) of the Act applied, as it was information " that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application for review ". This was said to be consistent with the approach taken by the Federal Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Chamnam You [2008] FCA 241. In You Sundberg J held that where an applicant gave the Tribunal a copy of a delegate's decision attached to his application for review which contained information that the Tribunal considered would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review, the applicant gave that information to the Tribunal for the purpose of the application for review. A distinction was drawn between the concept of " gave " in s.359A(4)(b) and the notion of " relied on ". His Honour indicated that while the applicant may not have incorporated or adopted the delegate's decision (which in that case referred to the results of a home visit to the applicant's home) nonetheless, while not relying on that information, he gave the Tribunal the delegate's decision. On that basis he was said to have given the information contained in the delegate's reasons to the Tribunal (at [16]) within s.359A(4)(b). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1185">The Tribunal noted in paragraph 33 of its reasons for decision that the delegate relied on information provided by Kangan that the applicant's attendance during the relevant period was 29.7%. If the Tribunal had relied only on that information, that would have been the end of the matter. [1] However, the Tribunal went on in paragraph 34 to note, and rely upon, the information that the applicant corroborated his attendance records at the hearing before the Tribunal, and the information in the attendance records themselves which the Tribunal said it had checked for itself. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1135">Moreover, in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Chamnam You [2008] FCA 241 Sundberg J said: The word "information" in s 359A(4)(b) is thus not confined to information the applicant thinks will advance his or her case, or information upon which the applicant relies in support of the application. If what is given to the Tribunal is information, it is covered by s 359A(4)(b). (at [22]) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 823">I accept this submission. I also accept on the binding authority of Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v You [2008] FCA 241 at [16] , that the presentation of this information in the delegate's statement of reasons, amounted to the 'giving' to the Tribunal of that information for the purposes of s.424A(3)(b). I therefore reject the particulars of breach of s.424A(1) falling into the first category. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 1079">It is not necessary, in order for information before the Tribunal to be governed by s.424A(3)(b) , that an applicant rely on that information which he or she has given to the Tribunal. Under the paragraph it is sufficient that the information is merely given by the applicant to the Tribunal for the purpose of the application: Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Chamnan You [2008] FCA 241. </sentence>
