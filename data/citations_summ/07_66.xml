<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 118">In NASB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 24 , which was cited with approval by Nicholson J in WAMB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 66 , Beaumont, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ said (at [42]): 
 
 [42] In order for an appellate court to receive further evidence, two conditions must be satisfied: first, the party seeking to adduce the evidence must show that it could not, with reasonable diligence, have been adduced at the trial; and, secondly, the evidence must be such that very probably the result would have been different: see, for example, Orr v Holmes [1948] HCA 16 ; (1948) 76 CLR 632 at 635---636 per Latham CJ. The second condition has been variously expressed in the cases, but the point made in all of them is that it is not enough that the new evidence was relevant and otherwise admissible, and may have affected the result. Language referring to, at the lowest, 'probability', and at the highest, 'certainty', of a different result, has been used: cf R v Copestake; Ex parte Wilkinson [1927] 1 KB 468 at 477 ('of such importance as very probably to influence the decision' and 'of such weight as, if believed, would probably have an important influence on the result'); Orr v Holmes at 636 ('high degree of probability that the admission of the new evidence would result in a different verdict'); Florance v Andrew (1985) 58 ALR 377 at 381 ('such a different complexion on the case that a reversal of the former result ought certainly to ensue'); Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 24 FCR 313 at 367---368 ((as agreed by the parties) 'almost certain that ..., an opposite result would have been reached by the primary judge').

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 755">In WAMB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 66 , Nicholson J said: "37 The appellant also relied on the contention that the Tribunal's finding in the core paragraph was 'illogical, irrational or lacking a basis in findings or inferences of fact supported on logical grounds'...I accept the submission of the respondents that a body of the Federal Court authority has made it clear that, notwithstanding the decision of the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Ex parte Applicant S 20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 , want of logic, or rationality, does not of itself suffice to constitute error of law, still less error of law which is jurisdictional: NBIO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1300 and VWFP and VWFO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA at [76]-[79]. " 
In MZXSA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCAFC 123 , the Full Court decided at [42] --- [43] that:
 
 42 It is not in doubt that a decision made by the Tribunal may be affected by jurisdictional error where it is irrational, illogical and not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex Parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at 67 [36] - [37]; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 20 [38] ; NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 at [130] - [139]. 
 
 43 This basis for the finding of jurisdictional error was most recently considered by the High Court in SZMDS.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 712">Generally, such errors will be within jurisdiction. All that the Tribunal was doing at this point in its reasons was explaining why it found the respondent's version of what happened unpersuasive. " 

In WAMB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 66 , Nicholson J said:
 
 "37 The appellant also relied on the contention that the Tribunal's finding in the core paragraph was 'illogical, irrational or lacking a basis in findings or inferences of fact supported on logical grounds'...I accept the submission of the respondents that a body of the Federal Court authority has made it clear that, notwithstanding the decision of the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Ex parte Applicant S 20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 , want of logic, or rationality, does not of itself suffice to constitute error of law, still less error of law which is jurisdictional: NBIO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1300 and VWFP and VWFO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA at [76]-[79].

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1188">" 

Insofar as the applicant contends that the finding was illogical, in SZZEO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2005] FCA 546 , Tamberlin J following a number of earlier Full Court authorities, said on the issue of want of logic in respect of Tribunal decisions:
 
 "14 The law is settled at the appellate level in this Court that the want of logic does not, of itself, suffice to constitute an error of law: see NACB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 235 at [30] per the Court (NACB); VWST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCAFC 286 at [18] - [19] per the Court (VWST); NATC v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 52 at [25] per the Court (NATC); and W404/01A of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 255 at [35] per Lee and Carr JJ. In the accordance with the settled authority, I would not depart from these decisions unless I formed the view that they were clearly in principle on this point. " 

In WAMB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 66 , Nicholson J said:
 
 "37 The appellant also relied on the contention that the Tribunal's finding in the core paragraph was 'illogical, irrational or lacking a basis in findings or inferences of fact supported on logical grounds'...I accept the submission of the respondents that a body of the Federal Court authority has made it clear that, notwithstanding the decision of the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Ex parte Applicant S 20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 , want of logic, or rationality, does not of itself suffice to constitute error of law, still less error of law which is jurisdictional: NBIO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1300 and VWFP and VWFO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA at [76]-[79]. " 

As stated in Applicants M160/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 195 at [32] :
 
 "...the Full Court has held that want of logic does not constitute an error of law and cannot constitute a ground for judicial review": Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Epeabaka [1999] FCA 1 ; (1999) 84 FCR 411 , 420-422; NACB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 235 at [22] - [29].

6 The respondent relied upon a joint judgment of Beaumont, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ in the more recent case of NASB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 24 , which was cited with approval by Nicholson J in WAMB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 66 , where their Honours had said at [43]:
 
 '43 In order for an appellate court to receive further evidence, two conditions must be satisfied: first, the party seeking to adduce the evidence must show that it could not, with reasonable diligence, have been adduced at the trial; and, secondly, the evidence must be such that very probably the result would have been different: see, for example, Orr v Holmes [1948] HCA 16 ; (1948) 76 CLR 632 at 635-636 per Latham CJ. The second condition has been variously expressed in the cases, but the point made in all of them is that it is not enough that the new evidence was relevant and otherwise admissible, and may have affected the result. Language referring to, at the lowest, 'probability', and at the highest, 'certainty', of a different result, has been used: cf R v Copestake; Ex parte Wilkinson [1927] 1 KB 468 at 477 ('of such importance as very probably to influence the decision' and 'of such weight as, if believed, would probably have an important influence on the result'); Orr v Holmes at 636 ('high degree of probability that the admission of the new evidence would result in a different verdict'); Florance v Andrew (1985) 58 ALR 377 at 381 ('such a different complexion on the case that a reversal of the former result ought certainly to ensue'); Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 24 FCR 313 at 367-368 ((as agreed by the parties) 'almost certain that, ... , an opposite result would have been reached by the primary judge').
