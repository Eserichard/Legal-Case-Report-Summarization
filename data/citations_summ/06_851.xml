 [13 --- 18] as representative of the law in relation to the "no evidence" rule. I noted at [13]: "However, a finding of the Tribunal that is a "critical step in its ultimate conclusion" for which there is no evidence in support can constitute jurisdictional error: SFGB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 at [19] . The fact of which there is said to be "no evidence" must be a jurisdictional fact; i.e. ""an essential preliminary to the decision-making process" as distinct from "a fact to be adjudicated upon in the course of the inquiry"": see VWBF v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 851 per Heerey J at [19] citing Colonial Bank of Australasia v Willan (1874) LR 5 PC 417 at 442-442, VXDC v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 1388 ; (2005) 146 FCR 562 at [13] . Otherwise a finding on credibility could not be disturbed: Re Minister for Immigration; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at [67] . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 327">In relation to this contention the applicant: accepts that to succeed on the contention, there must be no evidence at all upon which the finding could have been based; [95] says the Tribunal Decision refers to State and police action in South Africa in relation to xenophobic violence, however those findings do not support the Tribunal's conclusion outlined above. For example, the Tribunal stated: "A later report for the International Organisation of Migration (IOM) reported that South Africa has a long history of the xenophobia which leads to institutional and social discrimination and mistreatment of migrants... The discriminatory attitude to foreigners is found 'among citizens, police, and the elected leaders '.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 158">Be that as it may, I shall address each of the grounds as articulated. The first ground asserts that there is no evidence for some of the challenged findings. The authorities state that in order for that ground to be successful, it is necessary to show that there is no evidence at all upon which such a finding could be made. [3] In respect to the challenged findings being "illogical", logicality and irrationality in the reasoning of a Tribunal may constitute a basis for jurisdictional error. [4] However, for a decision to be illogical, it must be irrational and not based on findings or inferences supported by logic. [5] What must be shown is that the conclusion is one that no reasonable person could have arrived at. [6] This test has been held to be akin to the Wednesbury unreasonableness test. [7] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 56">Jurisdictional error may lie where the Tribunal "makes a finding and that finding is a critical step in its ultimate conclusion and there is no evidence to support that finding": see SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 at 407 [19] ; see also SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315 ; (2009) 108 ALD 515 at [53] - [54] and cases cited therein; Applicant A227 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 567 at [44] . Another approach to this question is 'jurisdictional fact' analysis: see, e.g., Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21 [39]; VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (' VWBF ') [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at 306 [19] , citing Colonial Bank of Australasia v Willan (1874) LR 5 PC 417 at 442---443 and VXDC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1388 ; (2005) 146 FCR 562 at [13] ; SZAPC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 995 at [47] , [57]. For present purposes, it is unnecessary to determine whether these two approaches co-exist and, if a choice is to be made, to identify the preferred approach. Under either approach, it is necessary to identify with precision the factual finding said to be unsupported by the evidence. Once this is done, it is clear enough that the appellant's no evidence ground fails. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 695">This ground claims an error in law in that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision. The Tribunal exhaustively set out the evidence both relied upon by the Applicant and the evidence the Tribunal considered. In its reasons, the Tribunal clearly identified many of the aspects of the evidence upon which it made its findings. An Applicant must demonstrate that there is no evidence at all upon which a finding could have been made: VWBF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; [2006] 154 FCR 302. This ground is misconceived as clearly it does not arise in the Tribunal decision under review. This ground cannot be sustained. Ground 4 (a)
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 827">Her Honour found that the appellant was unable to establish that the Tribunal's assessment of this evidence was not open to it for the reasons it gave. In particular, it had not been established that the Tribunal made a finding that was a critical step in its ultimate conclusion for which there was no evidence in support in the manner considered in SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 or that there was no evidence in relation to a jurisdictional fact or essential preliminary in the decision-making process (see VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302). The Federal Magistrate also referred to the discussion by Greenwood J in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [32] in relation to the limits of the no evidence ground. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 348">Dealing first with the grounds in the application, the first ground asserts that there was no evidence or other materials to justify the making of the decision. However in this case the Tribunal's decision was based on its appraisal of the applicant's claims having regard to the visitor visa application, the protection visa application and her oral evidence to the Tribunal. For the reasons it gave it found that the applicant was lacking credibility. It has not been established that the Tribunal's assessment of this evidence was not open to it for the reasons it gave. In particular, it has not been established that the Tribunal made a finding that was critical step in its ultimate conclusion for which there was no evidence in support in the manner considered in SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 or that there was no evidence in relation to a jurisdictional fact or essential preliminary in the decision-making process (see VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302). Also see more generally the discussion by Greenwood J in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 in relation to the limits of the no evidence ground. As his Honour concluded at [32]: A determination of the Tribunal as to a state of satisfaction or otherwise, of the relevant criteria or criterion in question, that is based upon a finding of fact or inferences drawn from facts, not based on logical or rational grounds, will give rise to an error of jurisdiction if there is no evidence to support the finding or no proper basis for drawing the inference; or, if there be some evidence, although inadequate, reliance by the Tribunal upon that inadequate evidence gives rise to an inference that the Tribunal has misconceived the test or is not, in reality, satisfied of the requisite matters, as a result of which there has been only a purported, rather than a real, exercise of the power conferred upon the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 8">In respect to ground 2, no s 424A(1) obligations arose in the present case. The matters particularised in the amended application as being part of the reasons for decision arose from the Applicant's testimony before the Tribunal. That testimony constituted information that was given by the Applicant to the Tribunal for the purpose of her application for review and was thereby excepted from s 424A(1) obligations by reason of s 424A(3)(b): NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41]- [64]; VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 at [48] ; SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35]. Further, the Tribunal's appraisal of that testimony was not information: SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [18] . Accordingly, in circumstances where no s 424A(1) obligations arose there can be no jurisdictional error based on s 424AA and in any case there is insufficient evidentiary basis for inferring a breach of s 424AA: SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [19] - [21]; NAOA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 241 at [21] .</sentence>

The fact of which there is said to be "no evidence" must be a jurisdictional fact; i.e. " "an essential preliminary to the decision-making process" as distinct from "a fact to be adjudicated upon in the course of the inquiry" ": see VWBF v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 851 per Heerey J at [19] citing Colonial Bank of Australasia v Willan (1874) LR 5 PC 417 at 442-442, VXDC v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 1388 ; (2005) 146 FCR 562 at [13] .

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 1316">In any event, the Tribunal decision was based on the applicant's oral evidence given at the Tribunal hearing, considered in the light of independent country information. Both the applicant's oral testimony and country information fall respectively within the statutory exemptions to the Tribunal's obligations under s.424A(1) , being information that " the applicant gave for the purpose of the application for review ": s424A(3)(b) , and information that " is not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member" : s.424A(3)(a). I accept the submission by the first respondent on this matter that: Neither source of information was subject to s 424A(1) obligations. In respect to the Applicant's testimony, that was given by the Applicant for the purpose of his application for review: see NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41] --- [64]; VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at [48] ; SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] . In respect to the country information, that was not specifically about the Applicant or another person: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572 ; QAAC of 2004 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCAFC 92. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 1136">The first respondent's primary argument was that the information in issue was given to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review in the course of the Tribunal hearing as considered in NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41] --- [64], VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at [48] and SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] .  In NBKT Young J also found that the applicant ' gave' the date of her arrival in Australia and the approximate date of her visa application " via her visa application and the written submission provided to the Tribunal by [her] adviser " (at [62]) and also that "by filing written submissions with the Tribunal that expressly referred to and incorporated the statement of grounds which was attached to her visa application, the appellant invited the Tribunal to refer to her protection visa application " (at [63]). This was said to indicate that the applicant intended the Tribunal to look at her application and hence was a sufficient basis to find she gave the date of her protection visa application to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review application. There were no such written submissions in this case. The applicant did not either himself or through an adviser provide any written submissions to the Tribunal. Hence the application of s.424A(3)(b) must be determined solely by reference to what occurred in the Tribunal hearing (cf VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 and M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 257">

26 In respect to the second ground of appeal, the first respondent submitted that there was no error in the finding made by the Federal Magistrate and that the information complained of fell within the ambit of s 424A(3)(b): NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41] --- [64]; VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at [48] ; SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] . The first respondent further contended in reliance upon SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 that, in any event, the information itself did not form part of the reason for decision but rather it was the Tribunal's appraisal of that information as being inconsistent with the appellant's claims to have suffered past persecution that was the reason for decision.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 241">20 Information need not be "volunteered" in order to be "given" for the purposes of s 359A(4)(b). It can be given in response to a question from the Tribunal rather than propounded by an applicant ab initio. In VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at [48] - [50] Heerey J said:
 
 
 48. For no apparent reason, almost all the discussion of s 424A(3)(b) in the cases proceeds on the basis that the provision uses the word 'provide'. The subsection in fact uses the verb 'to give', which simply conveys the notion of delivering or handing over (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FMCA 2018">Mr Mitchell contends that the reason for the Tribunal decision was that the applicants' claims were not plausible in light of the husband's testimony, their visitor's visa application and country information about India. The Tribunal's appraisal of the plausibility of their claim was not subject to s.424A(1) of the Act as that appraisal was not "information": SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [17] - [25]. Mr Mitchell contends that the applicant husband's testimony was given for the purposes of his application for review, notwithstanding that the answers given in response to questions asked by the Tribunal may have been informed by material taken from their visitor's visa application: NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41]- [64]; VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 at [48] ; SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] . I agree with Mr Mitchell's submission that the applicant husband's testimony was therefore exempt from s.424A(1) by reason of s.424A(3)(b). Significantly, the information conveyed in the visitor's visa application relied upon by the Tribunal was put to the applicants in the letter inviting them to comment on certain information dated 23 October 2006 (CB 70-71). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FMCA 1787">What constitutes the "giving" of information for the purposes of s.424A(3)(b) has been discussed in several cases, including SZEEU v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 2 ; VWBF v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 851 ; MZXBM v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1031 and NBKT v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 195.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2007] FCA 1031">However, this left undetermined the extent of the incorporation by reference and, adopting the objective approach referred to above, Rares J held the incorporation extended only to what had been said to the Department about his activities in China and not the whole of the information which had been given to it contained in the file. In SZCKD [2006] FCA 451 the information had been provided to the Tribunal by the applicant's agent in a 31 page facsimile including a number of other documents. In VWBF [2006] FCA 851 ; [2006] FCA 851 ; 154 FCR 302 the information in question was advanced on behalf of the applicant in a letter from his migration agent which stated that the applicant had already sent a statement to the Tribunal and requesting reference to a number of earlier statements and interviews. In SZCBQ [2006] FCA 1538 the applicant had stated in his application to the Tribunal 'Please Refer my Statement Claim of my Refugee Application'. I am unable to distinguish from this variety of language found to have effect as a giving for the purpose of s 424A(3)(b) from the language used by the present appellant. 26 On the issue of republication and adoption, there is a 'blizzard of cases': VWBF [2006] FCA 851 ; 154 FCR 302 at [23] per Heerey J. It is necessary, in the light of the facts in this appeal, to distinguish and put to one side generally those cases raising the issue of whether information has been given for the purpose of the application to the Tribunal where the information has been elicited as the consequence of a question from the Tribunal to an applicant. Of more relevance here on their facts are those cases where the applicant has expressly advanced information that had been initially given to the Department as part of the case on review to the Tribunal. In drawing this distinction in MZXFQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 826 Kenny J cited as illustrative of this latter category M55 [2005] FCA 131 at [25] per Gray J; VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271 at [11] per Merkel J; SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 at [24] and [50] per Rares J; SZCKD v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 451 at [37] per Graham J; VWBF [2006] FCA 851 ; 154 FCR 302 at 312 per Heerey J; and SZCBQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1538 at [12] per Bennett J. As her Honour stated, in these cases s 424A(3)(b) was held to apply.

Young J at [62] accepted that the information in NBKT 156 FCR 419 given by way of written submission from her advisor was given for the purposes of s 424A(3)(b) , applying VWBF [2006] FCA 851 ; 154 FCR 302 at [51] . 21 Additionally the first respondent submits that support for the objective approach favoured by Rares J is to be found in other single judge decisions in VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at [44] per Heerey J; SZCNP [2006] FCA 1140 at [18] per Tamberlin J; and SZDAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1598 at [22] per Middleton J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2007] FCA 827">12 The Minister concedes that a mere general affirmation of the correctness of information in a statutory declaration used for the purpose of a protection visa application is insufficient to satisfy the exception provided by s 424A(3)(b) of the Act. However, the Minister relies upon the appellant's acknowledgement that he had typed the statutory declaration, answered questions and was able to provide his understanding of a statutory declaration. The Minister submits that it was thereby adopted by him: see VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; [2006] 154 FCR 302 at [49] - [50]. For these reasons the Minister submits that the appellant provided the information in his statutory declaration to the Tribunal and that the exemption provided by s 424A(3)(b) applies to such information: see SZFXG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 116 and SZEPI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1645. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2007] FCA 826">42 The parties referred to numerous decisions in which an issue of this kind arose.

<sentence id="cs18" from="[2007] FCA 648">40 The approach taken in SZEEU to the SZEEU appeal itself could be regarded as inconsistent, indicating that Moore J considered that an applicant's adoption at a Tribunal hearing of what is contained in his protection visa application does not transform its contents into information provided by the applicant in his application for review. In VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 Heerey J considered the SZDXA and SZEEU appeals and concluded that information is given for the purposes of s 424A(3)(b) if the application conveys to the Tribunal, whether in answer to a question posed by the Tribunal, or by volunteering the information to the Tribunal. Where an applicant says at the hearing that he relies on what was said in his protection visa application then what is in the protection visa application is information given for the purposes of the application for review, within s 424A(3)(b). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2007] FMCA 402">Therefore the information on which it relied for the part of its decision was information provided by the applicant in circumstances where s.424A(3)(b) applied. 16. In support of this he relied on what Kenny J. found in SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 267 (" SZDPY "), especially at [35]-[36], and which was subsequently applied by Heerey J. in VWBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; [2006] 154 FCR 302 (" VWBS "), and as considered recently by the Full Court in NBKT v Minister Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 (" NBKT "). 17.

<sentence id="cs20" from="[2007] FCA 319">Nevertheless, it is one that the authorities suggest must be drawn. It is said to be a distinction between information which the applicant for review puts forward as part of his or her case and adopts, on the one hand, and information elicited by questions from the Tribunal on the other. It is sufficient for me to refer to M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 ; NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 744 ; (2005) 87 ALD 357 ; SZCJY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 556 and finally, VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 (' VWBF '). I would only add that, in relation to the relevant principles, I respectfully agree with the observation of Heerey J in VWBF as follows (at [48]):
 
 'If this matter were free from authority, there would be much to be said for the view that the applicant "gave" information for the purpose of the Tribunal review application if the information was delivered to the Tribunal by the applicant, whether in answer to a question asked by the Tribunal or whether volunteered.

 '[T]here is [a] question whether leave should be granted to raise this point, which was not argued before the Magistrate. For the reasons given in SZCJD [2006] FCA 609 at [19] , I think the appellant should have leave. The operation of s 424A has been the subject of a recent Full Court decision handed down on 24 February 2006, SZEEU [2006] FCAFC 2. In that case there crystallised for the first time at Full Court level what Weinberg J at [121] described as the "unanticipated but potent combination" of the Full Court's decision in Al Shamry (2001) 110 FCR 27 and the High Court's decision in SAAP (2005) 215 ALR 162. It may be true, as counsel for the Minister in the present case pointed out, that there were single judge decisions in June and July 2005 which considered this point, and the hearing before the Magistrate took place on 7 September 2005. Nevertheless some reasonable allowance should be made for the blizzard of cases concerning the Act that descend upon the profession and some time allowed before they can be taken as absorbed into the general understanding, even of those specialising in this area.

There was some discussion at the hearing about whether anything said by the Full Court, including myself, in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 was inconsistent with anything said by Heerey J in VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851. I do not think it appropriate or necessary for this case to enter an exegesis or gloss on other cases.

However, as the first respondent submitted, this information was also provided by the appellants to the Tribunal. This was not disputed by the appellants. As pointed out by Heerey J in VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) FCA 851 at pars 49 and 50: 
 
 'Likewise, if an applicant says to the Tribunal "What I said in my visa application is true" and that application contains fact X, the normal meaning conveyed would be that the applicant is giving the information constituted by fact X to the Tribunal, as well as the further fact that fact X had been asserted by the applicant when he made the visa application. 
 Such a reading of s 424A(1) and (3)(b) would be consistent with common law concepts of natural justice which require the decision-maker to give the person affected notice of relevant information obtained from another source but not, generally speaking, to invite comment on the evaluation of material submitted by the person himself: see Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591-592 and the cases there cited.
