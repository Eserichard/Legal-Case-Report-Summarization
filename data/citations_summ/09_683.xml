<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 122">94 The terms of the contract between Amex Intl and the cardholder are somewhat different for charge cards and credit cards. As summarized by the primary judge (see American Express International Inc v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 683 ; (2009) 73 ATR 173 (' American Express ') 177-8 at [12]), in the case of a charge card, the terms of the agreement between Amex Intl and the cardholder are:
 
 
 &#8226; A card may be used at any merchant displaying the American Express card's logo to pay for goods or services provided by the merchant: the card may also be used by mail, telephone order or through the internet. &#8226; The cardholder pays an annual fee for the use of the card and the services provided by card issuer. &#8226; The card holder is liable to the card issuer for all Charges on the card: a Charge is a transaction made with the card or charged to the cardholder's account. &#8226; The card issuer sends to the card holder once a month a statement for each period during which there is any activity or balance outstanding on the cardholder's account and the cardholder must pay the card issuer the full amount of the closing balance shown in the monthly statement. &#8226; If the card holder fails to pay the balance of the cardholder's account when due, the cardholder is liable to pay [an amount described as] liquidated damages. &#8226; No provision is made for the deferral of payment of any part of the balance of an account. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 178">45 The appellant made a parallel submission that the Commonwealth payment is made, not relevantly 'in connection with' the supply of transportation services, but as a subsidy 'in connection with' the Scheme. There was, according to the appellant, a novus actus interveniens , to use the words of Emmett J in American Express International Inc v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 683 ; (2009) 73 ATR 173 at [57] , breaking the nexus required by s 9-15(1).
