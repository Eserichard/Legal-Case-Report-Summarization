<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 348">Nicholson J delivered reasons in this matter in July 2007 in which his Honour considered the appropriate penalties and other relief for contraventions by the several respondents of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TPA): Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Admiral Mechanical Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1085. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 252">The person seeking the declaration must be able to secure a proper contradictor, that is to say, someone presently existing who has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought: Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 per Gibbs J at 437; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Admiral Mechanical Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1085 at [8] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1545">(ii) If the absence of a contradictor inhibits the Court in the performance of its duties under s 76 of the TP Act, s 13 of the Sites Act, or similar legislation, it may seek the assistance of an amicus curiae or of an individual or body prepared to act as an intervenor under FCR, O 6 r 17. (iii) If the Court is disposed not to impose the penalty proposed by the parties, it may be appropriate, depending on the circumstances, for each of them to be given the opportunity to withdraw consent to the proposed orders and for the matter to proceed as a contested hearing. See: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Admiral Mechanical Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1085 at [13] ---[18] per Nicholson J. Most recently, it has been said that the " upshot of the authorities is that the Court should not depart lightly from a joint position put forward by the parties. The inquiry to be undertaken is not whether the Court would have arrived at the same figure as the parties, but whether the proposal fixes an appropriate amount 'within the permissible range' of penalties that might properly be imposed ": Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Oobi Baby Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1488 at [9] per Finkelstein J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 344">36 It should be observed that each party has, in varying degrees, provided co-operation to the ACCC in its investigations. The joint submissions refer to the allowance made in the assessment of the penalties, which is an appropriate course: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Admiral Mechanical Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1085 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Service Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1172 ; (2004) ATPR 42-023.
