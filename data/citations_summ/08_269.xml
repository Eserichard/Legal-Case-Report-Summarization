<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 675">Moreover, the fact that the applicant attended the Tribunal hearing in this case is another distinction from the circumstances of SZFDE . The applicant was not denied his right to a hearing and as such there was no " stultifying " of the Tribunal's obligations to accord procedural fairness under Div.4 of Pt.7 of the Act. Similarly in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 269 at [42] Lander J considered an allegation of third party fraud where fresh claims had been raised when a matter was remitted for reconsideration. The appellant contended that he had not raised those claims earlier because a migration agent told him not to do so. Lander J pointed out that there was no evidence that as a result of anything done by the appellant's migration agent the Tribunal failed to comply with the procedures in Div.4 of Pt.7 of the Migration Act . The same may be said in this case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 158">The Tribunal is required to give accurate particulars of adverse information to the applicant. Its failure to do so is jurisdictional error. see SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 269  Quite how the case SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 269 referred to in ground 2 was relevant was not developed in the Appellant's written or oral submissions. I have considered that case, which I note was decided on 7 March 2008. Its relevance to ground 2 is not immediately apparent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 789">19 There is no unqualified duty imposed upon the Tribunal to make all such inquiries or to undertake all such investigations as a party may wish to be undertaken: cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 at [42] ---[43], 207 ALR 12 at 21---2 per Gummow and Hayne JJ.
