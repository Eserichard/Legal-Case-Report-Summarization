<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1135">11 It is commonly understood that applications for summary judgment should be brought promptly so as to avoid the incurrence of costs in preparing for trial. See Quinlan v Safe International Forsakrings AB [2006] FCA 1718 at [47] . This decision reflects a long line of cases in various jurisdictions. However it is not necessary to consider that proposition for present purposes. The plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to summary judgment or judgment upon the basis of admissions made by Giant Marine and upon the proper construction of the United Kingdom Standard Conditions for Towage and Other Services (Revised 1974) (the "Standard Conditions") which were incorporated into the contract between Giant Marine and Adsteam. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 647">13 The applicant contends that there should be no order for costs of the proceedings at all. He submits that the circumstances are analogous to those cases where, for whatever reason, there has been no adjudication of the parties' rights but it is no longer appropriate to continue the proceedings: see eg Re The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of the Commonwealth of Australia; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 at 625 to the following effect:
 
 If it appears that both parties have acted reasonably in commencing and defending the proceedings and the conduct of the parties continued to be reasonable until the litigation was settled or its further prosecution became futile, the proper exercise of the cost discretion will usually mean that the court will make no order as to the cost of the proceedings. 

See also the cases cited by McHugh J at footnote (7). More recently, that principle has been applied by Nicholson J in Quinlan v Safe International Forsakrings AB [2006] FCA 1718 at [45] - [46].</sentence>
