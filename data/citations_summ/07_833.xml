<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] NSWSC 1357">8 There are recent cases which have considered the somewhat similar situation where a witness, in his or her affidavit, adopts what he or she earlier said in a record of interview or similar document. Despite the general rule that a witness "ordinarily cannot give oral evidence by reference to the contents of a document" ( AWA Ltd v Radio 3XY Pty Ltd , unreported, NSWSC, 21 June 1991, McLelland J) , the general approach in those recent cases is that the witness's evidence may be given in the way I have outlined, but that the procedure gives rise to a need to exercise caution, particularly where some time has elapsed between preparation of the earlier record and the swearing of the adopting affidavit. The particular cases I have in mind are Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 833 and Temple v Powell [2007] FCA 987. </sentence>

19 Recently, a question very similar to that which arises in this case, arose before Buchanan J in an application for civil penalties by an Australian Building and Construction Commission inspector: Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 833. As part of an investigation into alleged breaches of the WR Act statements were taken from a number of people. They were signed and witnessed. The Commission subsequently sought to rely upon affidavits sworn or affirmed by people from whom the statements were taken in which they deposed to the truth and accuracy of the statements and exhibited them to the affidavits. Eight statements adopted in that fashion were relied upon at the hearing before Buchanan J as part of evidence-in-chief in the applicant's case. </sentence>
