<citphrase id="cp4.0" type=citing from="[2010] FCA 643">in accordance with the practice of the federal court in some cases of public interest, importance or complexity, the following summary has been prepared to accompany the orders made today. this summary is intended to assist in understanding the outcome of this proceeding and is not a complete statement of the conclusions reached by the court. the only authoritative statement of the court's reasons is that contained in the published reasons for judgment which will be available on the internet at http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/ together with this summary. put shortly but inexactly, the present application has been made on behalf of torres strait islanders who are descendants of an extensive list of named ancestors who were themselves torres strait islanders. to prevent further delay in the hearing of the application, the original claim area has been divided into parts a and b. my reasons relate only to part a. it encompasses the greater part of the original claim area. the principal respondents in this part are the state of queensland, the commonwealth of australia, a large group of people and companies collectively described as the commercial fishing parties and a small number of parties from papua new guinea. for native title act purposes, torres strait and the torres strait islanders are distinctive in many respects. that this is so, and the consequences of it, are markedly apparent in my reasons. the subject matter of the present proceeding is itself distinctive. it seeks a determination of native title rights and interests in a major part of the sea area of torres strait. the sea in turn is the integral presence in the lives and livelihoods of the islander communities. it has rightly been said that their occupation of the region has had "an essentially maritime character". unlike in native title claims in aboriginal australia, the laws and customs advanced by the communities do not reflect an overarching spiritual connection with the waters. there is no creation story. yet there are still some, for the most part minor, traditional spiritual beliefs revealed in the evidence. in consequence, the laws and customs of present concern are informed in quite some degree by considerations of utility and practicality. this has unusual ramifications in the application of accepted native title act jurisprudence. no more is this so than in relation to the "connection" requirement of s 223(1)(b) of the native title act 1993 (cth). the applicant's evidence is likewise distinctive. british and then australian sovereignty over the islands of torres strait was acquired for the most part in progressive steps taken, first, in 1872 and then in 1879. by these dates the grandparents of some of the indigenous witnesses were alive and were directly, or via the witness' parents, the sources of oral traditions recounted by those witnesses. from the time of luis baez de torres' passage through the strait in 1606, islander contact with europeans was the subject of recorded account and observation. notable amongst these after cook's rediscovery of torres strait were the writings of british naval officers and other mariners. in 1864 a joint imperial-colonial outpost was established at somerset on the eastern tip of cape york. at much the same time colonial occupation commenced in the strait. it related initially to the establishment of b&ecirc;che-de-mer shore fishing stations. in 1868 the pearl shell industry commenced. in 1871 the evangelisation of the strait began with the advent of the london missionary society. in consequence a significant pre</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp4.1" type=citing from="[2010] FCA 643">and early sovereignty literature was generated and is in evidence. the most significant body of works in this are the six volumes of reports of the cambridge anthropological expedition to torres strait. these were based largely on observations made in the strait in 1898 by a.c. haddon (a former zoologist) and six others. the main purpose of the expedition was to assemble a picture of life before colonisation from the memories of the older men. unlike with so much of aboriginal australia, the acquisition of sovereignty over the islands of the strait did not lead to the islanders being dispossessed of their lands or sea domains, or deprived of their traditional means of livelihood. their continuing presence in the strait is self-evident as are their detailed knowledge of, and exploitation of the marine resources of, the strait. as is now well known, native title was first accepted and recognised in relation to the murray islands in torres strait in the decision of mabo v queensland [no 2] [1992] hca 23 ; (1992) 175 clr 1. that decision and the twenty-two consent determinations since made under the subsequently enacted native title act have resulted in the recognition of native title in all of the presently inhabited islands of interest in this proceeding and in most of the uninhabited islands. characteristically the native title holders in these determinations were found to be members of single island communities. in several instances, though, the title is shared by members of several island communities. though the land determinations are of some contextual importance in this proceeding, it is to be emphasised that the present application relates to sea water areas. because of its present importance, i should emphasise that the nt act defines "waters" to include not only "sea ... a tidal inlet, a bay, an estuary" but also "the bed or subsoil under ... any waters" and "the shore, or subsoil under ... the shore, between high water and low water": s 253. the term is used with this meaning in my reasons. it also requires emphasis that, to the islanders, land and sea are seamlessly and culturally associated: there is no "sea-land dichotomy". i have concluded that the applicant has, for the most part, established its claim. there is a single torres strait islander society to which the native title claim group belongs. under that society's traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed, the claim group in aggregate holds native title rights and interests in the waters of torres strait with which i am presently concerned, save in those parts specified in my reasons. as the present proceeding does not involve the entirety of the native title claim area, it is inappropriate that i make a finding that the claim group alone constitutes the relevant society. it may be the case</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp4.2" type=citing from="[2010] FCA 643">and i express no view on this</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp4.3" type=citing from="[2010] FCA 643">that when the balance of the claim is heard and determined in relation to those areas where it overlaps other claims, the evidence may establish that one or both of the kaurareg and gudang peoples also belongs to the society for nt act purposes. i have rejected the state of queensland's contention that there were multiple societies (thirteen in number) each constituted by the islanders of an inhabited island. i likewise have rejected the commonwealth's contention that there were four societies each of which was made up of a regional cluster group of islands, eg the eastern islands. there is an irony in all of this. the issue of authorisation apart, the answer to the question of native title rights and interests in the waters of torres strait</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp4.4" type=citing from="[2010] FCA 643">which is, after all, the concern of the present application and of the nt act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp4.5" type=citing from="[2010] FCA 643">would in all probability have been largely, if not exactly, the same whether my conclusion had been one, or four, or thirteen, societies. i have rejected the applicant's claim insofar as it asserted that what it called reciprocity based rights and interests constitute native title for the purposes of s 223(1) of the act. put inexactly, those are rights based upon reciprocal personal relationships with persons who have native title rights in their own land and marine territories. the native title rights i have found are the non-exclusive rights of the group members of the respective inhabited island communities first, to access, to remain in and to use their own marine territories or territories shared with another, or other, communities; and, secondly; to access resources and to take for any purpose resources in those territories. in exercising these rights the group members are expected to respect their marine territories and what is in them. importantly, and this requires emphasis, none of these rights confer possession, occupation, or use of the waters to the exclusion of others. nor do they confer any right to control the conduct of others. the rights will be recognised by the common law beyond australia's territorial seas in its exclusive economic zone. the possibility that native title might exist in such an area was contemplated by the australian parliament in s 6 of the nt act. in the northern part of the claim area known colloquially as the "top hat", the native title rights are qualified by the provisions of australia's treaty with papua new guinea which came into effect in 1985. it settled the seabed boundary lines between the two countries and provided for australian "fisheries jurisdiction" in the "top hat". i have found that the right to take resources includes the right to take marine resources for trading or commercial purposes and that such use of them would be recognised by the common law. i have rejected the contentions of the state and of the commonwealth that the ever expanding regulatory controls placed upon commercial fishing by legislation extinguished any native title right to take fish for commercial purposes. those legislative controls were not directed at the underlying rights of the native title holders who were obliged to comply with the regulatory measures imposed on them if they were to enjoy their native title rights. the various acts severally or together did not, and do not, evince a clear and plain intention to extinguish native title rights to take fish for commercial purposes in the part a claim area. having said this, it needs to be emphasised that, to the extent that those legislative regimes regulate the manner in which, and the conditions subject to which, commercial fishing can be conducted in a fishery in the native title holders' marine estates, or prohibit qualifiedly or absolutely particular activities in relation to commercial fishing in the fishery in those estates, the native title holders must, in enjoying their native title rights, observe the law of the land. this is their obligation as australian citizens. complying with those regimes provides them with the opportunity</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp4.6" type=citing from="[2010] FCA 643">qualified it may be</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp4.7" type=citing from="[2010] FCA 643">to exercise their native title rights. a distinct part of my reasons deals with the extent to which the construction, operation and maintenance by the australian maritime safety authority under commonwealth legislation of aids to navigation in torres strait waters have extinguished or otherwise affected the enjoyment of native title in the areas of, or adjacent to, such aids. my conclusions on these matters are contained in my reasons. all i need note here is that, while i have reached conclusions in relation to ten of these aids, i have not in relation to another four. in consequence i have given the parties liberty to apply for the purposes of establishing the boundaries of the areas at each of the four sites where native title has been extinguished. while i have found that the application made in this matter was not in fact authorised as required by the native title act , i am satisfied that, for the purposes of s 84d of the act, it is in the interests of justice that the application be determined despite the defect in authorisation. finally, there are seven png parties to this proceeding. in the case of five of them, i will order that they cease to continue as parties to the proceedings. in relation to the remaining two, i will declare that they are not members of the native title claim group. i have been requested by the parties to provide them with the opportunity to make submissions on the form of the determination of native title to be made. this is entirely appropriate. i will direct that:</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 755">The following factors are relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion: 
(a) Proceedings for a determination of native title are proceedings in rem: they bind non-parties. It is also fundamental that an order which directly affects a third person's rights or liabilities should not be made unless the person is joined as a party: Gamogab v Akiba [2007] FCAFC 74 ; (2007) 159 FCR 578 at [59] , [60] per Gyles J. (b) Consideration of the rights and interests of the party joined would lead to a more accurate definition of the native title rights and interests claimed, including by limiting the scope of the rights and interests of an applicant: Akiba and Others on behalf of the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim People v State of Queensland (No 2) [2006] FCA 1173 ; (2006) 154 FCR 513 at [37] . (c) A party joined would also be able to protect the native title rights and interests they claim to hold from erosion, dilution, or discount by the process of the Court determining the claims of an applicant: Bonner on behalf of the Jagera People #2 v State of Queensland [2011] FCA 321 at [17] . (d) Whether the interest asserted can be protected by some other mechanism. For example, a factor in the exercise of the discretion in Akiba was that the interests could be protected under the Torres Strait Treaty: Akiba at [38]. (e) Whether the applicant for the determination would be prejudiced if the party applicant is joined: Worimi Local Aboriginal Council v Minister for Lands for New South Wales [2007] FCA 1357 ; (2007) 164 FCR 181 at [37] ; and 
 
(f) The history of the proceedings: Worimi at [5], [34]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 24">
 

 
In that case, one of a number of proposed respondent parties was joined because those respondent parties thought that their interests would be affected by the determination in the proceedings, and it was in the interests of justice that one rather than all of the individuals should be represented. See also Combined Dulabed Malenbarra/Yidinji Peoples v Queensland [2004] FCA 1097 ; (2004) 139 FCR 96 at [45] per Spender J and Combined Dulabed and Malenbarra/Yidinji Peoples v Queensland [2004] FCA 1632 ; (2004) 214 ALR 306 per Kiefel J at [12]. See also per French J (as his Honour then was) in Akiba &amp; Others on behalf of the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim People v State of Queensland (No 2) [2006] FCA 1173 ; (2006) 154 FCR 513 at [33] . In that case, French J concluded that the person seeking to be joined as a party did have an interest that may be affected by a determination in the proceedings, but in the exercise of his discretion he should not be joined as a party. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 643">959 The type of "interest" capable of enlivening the s 84(5) discretion can include "a special, well-established non-proprietary connection with land or waters which is of significance to [the] person" seeking joinder: Byron Environment Centre Inc v Arakwal People (1997) 78 FCR 1 (" Arakwal ") at 8; see also Akiba v Queensland (No 2) [2006] FCA 1173 ; (2006) 154 FCR 513 (" Akiba (No 2) ") at [33]-[34].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 595">In relation to the joinder of parties by the Court under s 84(5) NTA, again, the words (' and it is in the interests of justice to do so ') were added by way of the Native Title Amendment Act 2007 (Cth). As observed by French J prior to those amendments in Akiba and Others on behalf of the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim People v Queensland (No 2) [2006] FCA 1173 ; (2006) 154 FCR 513 (at [32]): 
 
 The Court has a discretion to join a person as a party to a native title determination application if the Court is satisfied that "the person's interests may be affected by a determination in the proceedings". There are therefore three elements to be considered in a decision under s 84(5) of the NTA: 
 
 Whether the person has an interest. Whether the interest may be affected by a determination in the proceedings. Whether, in any event, in the exercise of its discretion the Court should join the person as a party. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 321">One such joinder motion was brought by Mr Gamogab on behalf of the Dangaloub-Gizra Group at Kupere Village (also known as Kupiru) in the South Fly District of PNG. Mr Gamogab asserted traditional rights of movement and ownership and use of resources in the Torres Strait region which is now the subject of the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim, on behalf of the group. It is not necessary to record in these reasons, contextually or otherwise, the oral history of the Dangaloub-Gizra Group outlined by Mr Gamogab or the "Myth of Origin" passed from generation to generation which formed the basis of the joinder application. Mr Gamogab's application for joinder was determined by French J on 8 September 2006: Akiba and Others on Behalf of the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim People v State of Queensland (No 2) [2006] FCA 1173 ; (2006) 154 FCR 513 ( Akiba v State of Queensland (No 2) ). His Honour considered that Mr Gamogab had demonstrated an interest which would render him eligible for joinder as a party. However, his Honour concluded that, as a matter of discretion, Mr Gamogab ought not to be joined. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 1357">4 The matters for consideration under s 84(5) of the Act, as in force, in respect of Worimi's motion are:
 
 
 (1) Does Worimi have an interest within the meaning of s 84(5) of the Act? (2) May that interest be affected by a determination in the proceedings? (3) In any event, should the Court exercise its discretion to join Worimi as a respondent? 
 

( Akiba v Queensland (No 2) [2006] FCA 1173 ; (2006) 154 FCR 513 at [32] not the subject of comment by Gyles and Sundberg JJ on appeal in Gamogab v Akiba [2007] FCAFC 74). </sentence>

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
 
KIEFEL J:
 
 1 The first and second respondents are the surviving persons who applied for a native title determination on behalf of the Torres Strait Regional Sea Claim Group ('the Claim Group') which comprises communities of islanders in the Torres Strait. The appellant is a Papua New Guinea ('PNG') national and lives at Kupere Village in the South Fly District. He applied, unsuccessfully, to the Court for an order joining him as a respondent to the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim ( Akiba &amp; Others on behalf of the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim People v State of Queensland (No 2) [2006] FCA 1173 ; (2006) 154 FCR 513 ). His application was said to have been made on behalf of the Dangaloub-Gizra group. The appellant claimed traditional rights and interests with respect to the Torres Strait Regional Claim Area. 

 56 It is unnecessary for the purpose of these reasons to explain why the primary judge perceived the risk that he did that led him to refuse joinder. That is set out in his reasons ( Akiba [2006] FCA 1173 ; 154 FCR 513 particularly at [35]---[47]). Accepting that there was such a risk, in my respectful opinion, the exercise of discretion miscarried. Firstly, the primary judge appeared to consider that the discretion to join or not to join a party was, in effect, at large. In my opinion, that is wrong. Secondly, the risk perceived by the primary judge could have been dealt with by imposing appropriate terms upon joinder preventing the appellant from relying upon the matters that the primary judge regarded as inappropriate. 
 NATURE OF DISCRETION</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1057">9 On 16 February 2006 Mr McKenzie and others lodged the second Kuyani claim (the Kuyani-Wilyaru People Native Title claim). It again overlapped in part the area of the overlap proceedings. Orders were made in these proceedings that the new claim be dealt with to the extent of the overlap. The new claim suffered from the same vices that affected the first Kuyani claim --- a matter raised by the ALRM. A notice of discontinuance was filed by the Kuyani-Wilyaru applicants on 31 May 2006 and an order was made in the overlap proceedings that orders made in it regarding the Kuyani-Wilyaru application cease to be operative. Mr McKenzie nonetheless remains a respondent in the overlap proceedings apparently on the basis that, notwithstanding the discontinuance, he claimed to hold native title in relation to land in the area covered by the proceedings: s 84(3)(a)(ii); or else his interests might be affected by a determination in it: see s 84(3)(a)(iii). I would note in passing that it is well settled that a native title interest suffices as "an interest" for the purposes of becoming a party to a proceedings under s 84(3)(a)(iii) and (5) of the NT Act: Akiba v Queensland (No 2) [2006] FCA 1173 ; (2006) 154 FCR 513 at [34] ; Munn v State of Queensland [2002] FCA 486 at [8] ; Rubibi Community v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 876 ; (2002) 120 FCR 512 ; Davis-Hurst v Minister for Land and Water Conservation (NSW) [2003] FCA 541 ; (2003) 198 ALR 315 at [27] . </sentence>
