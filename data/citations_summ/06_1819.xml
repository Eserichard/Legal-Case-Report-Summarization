<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] WASAT 154">Preliminary issue 1: whether sections 36(1), 36(4) and 37(1) apply to the exercise of jurisdiction by the registrar
 
 31 The builder submits that the authority delegated to the registrar must be exercised in accordance with the power creating it: Dai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1819 at [30] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 644">The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision. The appellant sought judicial review. At first instance the application was dismissed (see Dai v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1819 ; (2006) 96 ALD 309). On appeal an issue arose as to the construction of condition 8202 that would activate the power of the Minister to cancel a visa under s.116(3) given that " non-compliance with the condition, and the trigger for cancellation, arises upon non-certification of satisfactory performance rather than upon certification of unsatisfactory performance " (North J at [8]). As his Honour put it: " The issue that emerges is how could a visa holder comply or fail to comply with the condition if required to provide certification, over which the visa holder has no control" (North J at [8]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCAFC 199">1 Before the Court is an appeal against orders made by a judge of the Court which dismissed two applications for review of a decision made by the Migration Review Tribunal ( Wen Bi Dai v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1819 ; (2006) 96 ALD 309). The decision of the Tribunal confirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, to cancel the visa held by the appellant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 1294">19. In Wen Bi Dai v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1819 Bennett J found that regulations providing for certificates from education providers (which were conclusive evidence with respect to student visas) were valid. I find that the regulations are valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 1525">18. The first respondent argued that there was clear legislative authority in s.505 of the Act for the making of regulations permitting the Minister to obtain a binding opinion from a person of a specified class. The first respondent referred to Wen Bi Dai v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1819 at [38] and [39] where Bennett J said: 
 
 
 [38] Section 505 , which refers specifically to such matters for visa applicants, does not delegate the whole of power to decide whether an applicant for a visa satisfies the relevant criterion. The section provides for the making of regulations under which the Minister, when required to decide whether an applicant for a visa satisfies a specified criterion, may obtain the opinion, assessment, finding or decision of a specified person or organisation and have regard to it and to take it to be correct. 
 [39] The sub-delegation in s 505 is not of a legislative but of an administrative character. It is not the delegation of a wide field of operation but, rather, a narrow question of fact. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 100">The interplay of condition 8202 and the Education Services for Overseas Student Act 2000 and the Migration Act 1958 was also considered by Bennett J in Wen Bi Dai v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1819.</sentence>
