<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 100">Zhou has since been applied: as per Siopis J in Cheng v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1028 [54] --- [59]; Liyanage v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1489 per Marshall J at [42].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1819">14 There is no basis for permitting the latest amendment and leave to amend should be refused. Apart from the general discretionary factors that would apply to an application to amend after the conclusion of the hearing, the applicant elected to seek merits review in the Tribunal of the Delegate's decision. The fact that such a review cured, in a legal sense, any defect in the hearing before the Delegate attributable to a denial of natural justice is now settled ( Zubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344 ; Uddin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 218 ; (2005) 149 FCR 1 (special leave to appeal refused); Humayun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 35 ; (2006) 149 FCR 558 at [30] ; Cheng v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1028 at [67] ). There is no reason to permit the applicant to amend to seek orders against the Delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FMCA 1726">This approach was affirmed by the Full Federal Court in Minister for Immigration v Zhou [2006] FCAFC 96 when it stated that there was no legal inter-relationship between s.20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth) ("ESOS Act") and s.116 of the Act. In this matter, the applicant's visa was cancelled under s.116 of the Act on the ground that he had breached condition 8202 of his visa. Section 116 gives the first respondent power to cancel a visa if she is satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with a condition of the visa: Cheng v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1028. The applicant's argument of a defect in the s.20 notice has been considered in a number of recent cases and such a defect was held as not affecting the power to cancel under s.116: Humayun v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 35 ; Minister for Immigration v Zhou . I accept the submissions by Ms Sirtes that this ground cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FMCA 1545">( Kioa v West at 612) 
 

Mr Leerdam submits that the two principles as discussed by Brennan J are clear that there is no legal interaction between the two processes. 
 32. Mr Leerdam's second argument is that this conclusion was also reached in Cheng v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1028 at [68] per Siopis J: 
 
 
 The applicant submitted that she had been denied procedural fairness because of the misleading nature of the s 20 Notice. 
 

Mr Leerdam submits that Zhou held that there was no legal relationship or interaction between the two cancellation processes, which leads to the conclusion that there was no procedural fairness obligation arising from the s.20 notice in the visa cancellation made under s.116 of the Act. Justice Siopis went on to say at [72] and [75]:
