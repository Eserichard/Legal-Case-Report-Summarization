<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] ATMO 92">I do not consider the court's findings will be determinative of either the s 42(b) or s 60 ground of opposition. The registrar has an obligation to decide the issue on the evidence before the registrar and on the law as it is when the hearing takes place [18] . This does not preclude the registrar from taking account of a court's finding, accepting it into evidence and attributing to it whatever weight the registrar considers appropriate. In this case, there is a degree of similarity between the issues and evidence involved, and it may be that the findings of the Full Court would be relevant to the opposition. But I think this case falls short of being one where the hearing and the resolution of the case will directly depend on the outcome of the appeal as envisaged in Geelong Football Club Ltd v Clifford. [19]  The registrar must take all necessary steps to get opposition proceedings ready for hearing as soon as practicable and thereafter hold the hearing [20] . Should the subsequent decision result in an improper registration, there are legislative provisions under which the register can be rectified. Here the matters are ready to be heard and, in the absence of appropriate reasons to the contrary, I consider Bickford is entitled to pursue registration of its marks and enjoy any benefits which may ensue.
