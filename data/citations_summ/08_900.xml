<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 466">Even when wound together these "public interest" strands lack strength. As already noted, there is no general "public interest" exception to the operation of the ordinary "rule". It is necessary for an unsuccessful party who wishes to obtain a more beneficial costs order to point to particular aspects of the litigation which warrant the orders sought. The legislative provisions do not assist LFF's case. An object of promotion of a co-operative approach to the protection of the environment has no implications for the determination of costs questions when co-operation gives way to litigation. The expanded standing provisions in s 487 do not, as Heerey J held in Your Water Your Say Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (No 2) [2008] FCA 900 at [8] "carry any particular significance on the issue of costs. " The standing provision is not designed to encourage litigation and, in any event, the issue would not arise unless the unsuccessful applicant had standing in the first place. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 200">9 Second, " there is no special costs regime applicable to 'public interest' litigation ": Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth [2006] FCAFC 51 at [6] , [2006] FCAFC 51 ; 230 ALR 411 at 413 per Black CJ, Moore and Emmett JJ. Similarly, in rejecting a broadly expressed submission as to " public interest litigation ", Gummow J (when sitting as a Judge of this Court), has observed that " there are no special categories which control the general discretion given by s 43 ": Council of the Municipality of Botany v Secretary, Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (1992) 34 FCR 412 at 416. But a legitimate public interest in the importance of the issues resolved is a factor that may be taken into account when exercising the discretion conferred by s 43. Instances can be provided where the public interest has been a factor relied upon in not making an order for costs (eg, Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 8 at [68] ---[75] [2008] FCA 8 ; , 165 FCR 211 at 227---8) or in making an order confining costs to only part of the costs otherwise payable (eg, Wilderness Society Inc v Minister for Environment and Water Resources [2008] FCAFC 19 , 101 ALD 1) ; instances can also be provided where such a factor has not prevailed (eg, Your Water Your Say Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage &amp; the Arts (No 2) [2008] FCA 900). Some of the authorities relevant to a discretionary power to order the payment of costs and the public interest, it may be noted, have been usefully collated and discussed by Professor Campbell in ' Public Interest Costs Orders ' [1998] AdelLawRw 20 ; (1998) 20 Adel L Rev 245. </sentence>
