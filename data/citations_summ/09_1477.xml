<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1180">In the case of Gyro Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1477 , Nicholas J considered whether to set aside, under O 35 r 7, a winding-up order which had been made about five months earlier. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 1056">23 In Gyrro Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1477 , it was held that mere inattentiveness to the defendant's affairs by its directors was insufficient to warrant the exercise of the equivalent power under the rules of the Federal Court. Nicholas J said (at [19]):
 

 
 
 "In the present case there is no satisfactory explanation given for the Defendant's non-appearance. The Defendant simply says that its directors left the country to live abroad and, while away, neglected to attend to the company's affairs for a period of almost five years. I think this is a factor that tells against the exercise of any discretion in favour of the Defendant. " </sentence>
