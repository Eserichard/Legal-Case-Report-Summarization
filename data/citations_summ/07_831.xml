<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 942">76 In December 2006 the defendant filed an application against the Commonwealth of Australia in the Federal Court in respect of the cufflinks (proceedings number NSD2478/06) which Stone J transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court. In March 2007 Lloyd-Jones FCM ordered the defendant to produce documents relating to his income and financial resources, together with other documents concerning his proceedings in other courts or tribunals, and all documents recording costs orders made against him ( Croker v Commonwealth of Australia proceedings number SYG548/07). In May 2007 the defendant filed an application in the Federal Court for leave to appeal from those orders on the basis that compliance would result in substantial injustice. Edmonds J refused leave to appeal on the basis that the defendant failed to demonstrate that the Magistrate's discretion had miscarried ( Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 831 at [5] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 452">25 On 24 May 2007 Edmonds J, having observed that the applicant had not put before his Honour any material upon which 'I might conclude that the orders made below are attended with sufficient doubt to warrant them being reconsidered by this Court' refused the application for leave with costs: see Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 831. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1593">7 At the commencement of proceedings to deal with his application for leave to appeal Mr Croker sought an adjournment so that he might have further time to prepare. The application for an adjournment was not consented to. I refused it. This is Mr Croker's second application for leave to appeal against interlocutory orders made in the present proceedings before the FMCA. In Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 831 , when dismissing his first application, Edmonds J referred (at [4]) to the test to be applied in the disposition of such an application. In my view Mr Croker had ample opportunity to prepare himself to address the orders with respect to which he seeks leave to appeal in the light of the test to be applied.</sentence>
