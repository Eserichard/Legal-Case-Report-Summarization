<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1136">As Young J observed in NBKT at [59] " Both SZEEU and NAZY suggest that the exception may not apply where the appellant does no more than affirm the accuracy of a statement which contains many diverse pieces of information. " It is relevant to have regard to the nature of the information in question ( NBKT at [59]). While information may be " given " by an applicant in response to Tribunal questioning (see SZCJD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2008] FCA 609 at [43], SZHFC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1389 and NBKT at [57]), in the circumstances of this case, the applicant's affirmation of the accuracy of his protection visa application did not of itself constitute adopting in terms or giving the specific items of information in question to the Tribunal for the purposes of review. While the information in question may in one sense be said to be " uncontentious factual material ", as submitted by the applicant, when considered in the context of the criteria for a protection visa, the fact and extent to which the applicant spoke, read and wrote Hindi and Punjabi and the precise circumstances of his residence in Rajasthan were contentious, in as much as they impacted upon the Tribunal's view of his ability to relocate and hence on a determination of whether he had a well-founded fear of persecution in India. Hence the character of this information can be distinguished from that in issue in NBKT on the objective basis suggested by Rares J in SZGGT (at [36] --- [49]), particularly having regard to considerations of fairness in the process. </sentence>
