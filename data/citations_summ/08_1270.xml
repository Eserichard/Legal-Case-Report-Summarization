<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 911">The basis upon which the second Tribunal decision was challenged before the Federal Magistrates Court was apprehended bias on the part of the Tribunal. In this Court that ground is not repeated in the notice of appeal. Rather the notice of appeal contains two grounds which are as follows: His Honour erred in failing to find that the Second Respondent failed to take into account relevant considerations. 
Particulars
 
 
(a) The Second Respondent failed to consider whether or not the Appellant, by reason of his status as a repatriated asylum seeker, member of the ethnic majority belonged to a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention. His Honour, bound by authorities of this Court, erred in failing to find that the Second Respondent breached section 424AA of the Migration Act and in failing to find that the Second Respondent's breach of section 424AA gave rise to jurisdictional error. 
Particulars
 
 
(a) The Appellant asserts that a number of matters decided by this Court were wrongly decided in relation to this point, including, but not limited to SZLXI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1270 and SZLWI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1330.  As to ground 2, there are decisions of judges of this Court in respect of s 424AA which hold that the extending of an oral invitation to provide information in response to particulars furnished by the Tribunal is permissive, rather than a matter of obligation. See SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 ; (2008) 103 ALD 589 ; and SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134. The ground of appeal invites me not to follow those decisions. I would only do that if I were persuaded that they are clearly wrong. On its face, the language of s 424AA is eloquent in the contrast between the use of the word "may" in para (a), and the use of the word "must" in para (b). As a matter of construction, it seems to me that para (a) of s 424AA is, indeed, permissive. I am not persuaded, on the basis of that examination, that either of the decisions mentioned should not be followed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 650">It was further submitted, however, that the Tribunal did put information about inconsistencies to the Applicant in accordance with the provisions of s.424AA of the Act. The Minister referred to the decision of SZLQD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [7] and SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [8] . The submission is that the Tribunal complied with s.424AA and did not fall into error on that basis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 631">Although the second ground in the application refers to s.424AA as having been breached, in truth it is an allegation that the Tribunal did not comply with the obligations it had under s.424A. This allegation is particularised by reference to the particulars of the first allegation made in the application. Those particulars are: (i) information concerning Christians in China; RRT decision page 10-12 of 15 para 39-44; (ii) information contained in the Applicant's daughter's passport; a translated copy of the Applicant's daughter's birth certificate with her father's name (the Applicant's husband's name) also a translated copy of the applicant's marriage certificate with her husband's name spelt in English. (iii) information contained in the applicant's protection visa application related Applicant claim that she was a member of a house church in China and that she personally feared persecution in China for that reason and a letter from Victor Yzung, B.Min, J.P (senior pastor) to the extent that SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 suggests that information and particulars (a) and (b) do not fall within s.424AA. It is wrongly decided.  As to the allegation that SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 was wrongly decided, I do not agree and said so in SZMMP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1509. My decision was affirmed on appeal by Lander J whose decision enjoyed the approval of the Full Court of the Federal Court in SZMCD's case . I do not agree that SXLXI's case was wrongly decided but, even if I did, I am bound by the Full Court's finding that it was correct: SZMCD's case at [133]. Failing to take relevant considerations into account and illogicality 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 558">As the Tribunal has a complete discretion to invoke the provisions of s 424AA , it was not necessary for the Tribunal to comply with section 424AA. Finally, non compliance with the provision (even if embarked upon) would likely not amount to jurisdictional error in any event: see SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 per Tracey and Foster JJ at [103] --- [104], Moore J agreeing at [1]. [15] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 537">If the former were the case and the Tribunal did not intend to activate the discretionary notification procedure contained in s 424AA, the Tribunal was merely discharging its obligations under s 425: see SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 ; (2008) 103 ALD 589 at [24] . Section 424AA is engaged only where the Tribunal clearly elects to exercise its discretion by following the procedure specified in that section. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 471">There are a large number of authorities to support the above. (See SZMMP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 per Lander J at [63], and also SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 per Cowdroy J, SZMAE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 per Edmonds J, SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1866 per Middleton J, SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 per Gilmour J and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 per Jaggot J, cited in SZMMP at [63] and in SZMCD at [98]. See also SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [99] . ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCAFC 46">98 At [63] of his Honour's reasons, his Honour noted that his Honour's decision was consistent with decisions of other judges of this Court in SZLXI [2008] FCA 1270 (Cowdroy J), SZMAE [2008] FCA 1701 (Edmonds J), SZITH 105 ALD 541 , [2008] FCA 1866 (Middleton J), SZLWI [2008] FCA 1330 ; 171 FCR 134 (Gilmour J) and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 (Jagot J). 48 Counsel for the first respondent submitted that the only consequence of non-compliance with the specific requirements of s 424AA is that the Tribunal does not get the benefit of the provisions of s 424A(2A). It was submitted on behalf of the first respondent that this interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions was supported by five cases in this Court, namely: SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] ; SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 103 ALD 589 , [2008] FCA 1270 at [27] ; and SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134 at [19] ; SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 at [23]; and SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 105 ALD 541 , [2008] FCA 1866 at [56] ---[60]. Each of those cases was decided by a single judge sitting on appeal from a Federal Magistrate. The decisions contain the views of five judges of this Court. Each authority is recent.

Cowdroy J suggested in that case (at [27] that: However, as s 424AA is merely an alternative form of notification available to the Tribunal (see s 424A(2A)) , the Court considers that the exclusions contained in s 424A(3) apply with equal force to s 424AA. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCA 233">The Federal Magistrate concluded that the applicant's submission was to particularise and expand on information which the Tribunal had paraphrased or summarised in what it put to the applicant. He concluded that whilst the Tribunal could have put what was said to be what should have been put, the Tribunal could not be criticised for summarising the information in the way that it did. For those reasons, the Federal Magistrate concluded that even if the Tribunal had an obligation to give information pursuant to s 424AA(b)(i) that it did not breach that obligation. However, the Federal Magistrate also concluded that the information in question was independent country information which the Tribunal had no obligation to notify to the applicant. He followed a decision of Cowdroy J in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 in which his Honour concluded that the exclusions contained in s 424A(3) applied with equal force to s 424AA. The Federal Magistrate concluded that that decision stood for the proposition that independent country information did not have to be provided to an applicant under s 424A(1) and s 424AA. The Federal Magistrate analysed for himself the two sections and came to the same conclusion as Cowdroy J and, in doing so, disagreed with a decision of Driver FM in SZLTC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 384 to the contrary.  The applicant's contention as to the construction in s 424AA has been considered and rejected by other members of the Court in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 (Cowdroy J), SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 (Edmonds J), SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1866 ; (2008) 105 ALD 541 (Middleton J), SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 (Gilmour J) and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 (Jagot J). Although the reasons in those cases may not be as these reasons, I agree in the results. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FMCA 180">The first thing that a Tribunal has to do is to decide whether or not there is any "information" and it is only if such information exists that these sections come into play. The "information" which the applicant describes in this particular case is information about inconsistencies. In SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 1270 , Cowdroy J sitting on appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court states at [26]: "The Tribunal found that there were inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence. Scarlett FM noted that it was well established that inconsistencies in evidence did not constitute "information" for the purposes of s.424A of the Act (see SZBYR &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship &amp; Anor [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [18] ) and accordingly do not constitute "information" for the purposes of s.424AA. [27] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FCA 167">Moreover, the exclusions contained in s 424A(3) apply with equal force to s 424AA, therefore the Tribunal is not compelled to give an applicant any particulars of country information which it intends to rely on during the hearing nor information that the applicant gave for the purposes of the application for review: see s 424A(3) and SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 104 ALD 589 ; [2008] FCA 1270 at [29] ---[30];. Such an inference is supported by the collective use of the term 'information' in s 424A(2A) of the Act (which applies to both ss 424A and 424AA), as such use implies uniformity of meaning. Therefore, the Court considers that what is not 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1) of the Act is also not 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1): SZLXI at [27]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FCA 142">The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal did not rely on any "information" as a reason for affirming the delegate's decision and therefore s 424A(1) was not enlivened such that s 424A(2A) applied (see [2008] FMCA at [20]). His Honour relied upon: SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270. The Federal Magistrate also found that the Tribunal had not breached s 425 of the Act as that section was interpreted by this Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 128 FCR 553 (see [2008] FMCA at [22]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FCA 139">Section 424A(3) identifies material that is not 'information' to which s 424A applies. Material that is not 'information' for the purposes of s 424A of the Act is also not 'information' for the purposes of s 424AA. See SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 at [27] per Cowdroy J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] FCA 83">The primary judge held that the information about the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) fell within s 424A(3). As s 424AA was an alternative method of complying with the obligation in s 424A the distinction between the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to which the Tribunal referred during the hearing was not "information" within the meaning of either s 424A or s 424AA (citing SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 103 ALD 589 ; [2008] FCA 1270).  Neither this Court nor the Federal Magistrates Court has jurisdiction to interfere with those findings of fact which were clearly open to the Tribunal on the evidence. Otherwise these grounds relate to an alleged denial of procedural fairness. In SZLXI (2008) 103 ALD 589 ; [2008] FCA 1270 Cowdroy J held that the exceptions in s 424A(3) must apply to s 424AA as that section is merely an alternative method of providing appellants with information. In SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 at [23] Edmonds J observed that: 
 [23] In any event, the Minister submitted that no jurisdictional error arises. Section 424AA itself imposes no obligation upon the Tribunal. Section 424AA itself imposes no obligation upon the Tribunal. It provides an alternative means by which the Tribunal may give to the applicant 'information' that it is otherwise required to give in writing pursuant to s 424A(1) of the Act. A jurisdictional error will only arise if there is a breach of s 424A ( SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 at [23] ---[28]; SZLWI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [17] ---[21]; SZLQD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] ). There was no 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1) , and s 424AA was not engaged. I agree with these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] FCA 90">Whether this issue is approached upon the basis of a claimed contravention of section 424A(1) or section 424AA , the result is the same. There is authority for the proposition that "information" in section 424AA has the same meaning as "information" under section 424A: SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 at [27] per Cowdroy J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] FMCA 8">Counsel for the applicant also made oral submissions in which she contended, by reference to the court book and the transcript, that a particular social group claim fairly arising from the available material had not been considered in any meaningful sense by the Tribunal. Counsel also submitted "formally" that the Federal Court's interpretation of s.424AA of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act ") in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1270 at [27] and SZLWI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1330 was wrong and that my interpretation of the section in SZLTC v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 384 at [15] - [16] should be preferred. That was a formal submission because I am bound by the Federal Court decisions in SZLWI and SZLTC to the extent of inconsistency with my own. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FCA 1866">58 It has been held on a number of occasions in this Court that ss 424AA and 424A provide specifically how certain matters are to be brought to the attention of an applicant by a tribunal, and that s 424AA enables information which would need to be given in writing under s 424A to be given orally if an applicant appears before a tribunal: see SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] per Marshall J; SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 at [27] per Cowdroy J; SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134 , 139 at [19] per Gilmour J; and SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 at [23] per Edmonds J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2008] FMCA 1647">Moreover, I accept the submissions of the Minister's counsel that the Tribunal was under no jurisdictional obligations to follow the procedure in s.424AA. On my reading of the Tribunal's decision, there was no "information" which it relied upon as a reason for affirming the delegate's decision, and which would have given rise to a breach of its obligations under s.424A(1) if the Tribunal did not follow the procedures in s.424AA so as to cause s.424A(2A) to apply. Recent judgments in this Court have followed the judgment of Cowdroy J in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 , to hold that s.424AA operates only as a adjunct to s.424A(1) (see SZMDJ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 1298 at [21] and [22]). I am, therefore, not persuaded that there is any jurisdictional error made by the Tribunal in relation to s.424AA. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] FCA 1837">The argument in reliance on s 424AA which was advanced this morning in support of the appeal was dealt with by the learned Federal Magistrate in his reasons, at [21] and [22] where his Honour said;
 '21. The second ground of the application contends that the Tribunal failed to comply with obligations under s.424AA. As counsel for the Minister points out, a recent decision of Cowdroy J in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Court has held, in paragraphs [23]-[27], in effect, that s.424AA is not a self-standing procedural provision, such that any non-compliance gives rise to jurisdictional error vitiating a decision of the Tribunal. His Honour appears to have concluded from legislative history that the intended consequence of any non-compliance with s.424AA is only that s.424A(2A) will not apply to excuse a procedure under s.424A(1) , whether the non-compliance arises from a discretionary decision not to follow the s.424AA procedure or from defects occurring in the procedure when purportedly followed. On this construction, the s.424AA procedure operates only as an embellishment or qualification to obligations under s.424A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2008] FMCA 1686">As stated in SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134 at [19] , s.424AA does not impose any obligation on the Tribunal. It enables the Tribunal (if it chooses to do so) to give oral particulars of adverse information to an applicant at a hearing that may otherwise have to be given in writing under s.424A(1). If the Tribunal chooses to give oral particulars of information under s.424AA but fails to comply with the requirements of s.424AA(b) the consequence is not that it falls into jurisdictional error. Rather the consequence is that s.424A(2)(a) is not engaged. Section 424A(2)(a) exempts the Tribunal from the obligation to give written particulars of information in s.424A(1) if it has given clear particulars and invited comment or response under s.424AA. It is also relevant to note that in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 1270 ; (2008) 103 ALD 589 at [27] Cowdroy J expressed the view that while s.424AA does not contain a provision equivalent to s.424A(3) , " what is not 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1) of the Act is also not 'information' for the purposes of s 424AA. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2008] FMCA 1609">As the Minister's Counsel submits, current authority in the Federal Court holds that the procedure under s.424AA can only give rise to jurisdictional error if s.424A(1) would have been engaged. I explained in SZMDJ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 1298: [21] The second ground of the application contends that the Tribunal failed to comply with obligations under s.424AA. As counsel for the Minister points out, a recent decision of Cowdroy J in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Court has held, in paragraphs [23]-[27], in effect, that s.424AA is not a self-standing procedural provision, such that any non-compliance gives rise to jurisdictional error vitiating a decision of the Tribunal.

On this construction, the s.424AA procedure operates only as an embellishment or qualification to obligations under s.424A(1). Counsel for the Minister noted that this construction has been applied in several cases in this Court, and I consider that I should do likewise. [22] The construction has the consequence that, even if there were any failure to follow procedures described in 424AA, it would also be necessary to establish that the Tribunal's decision relied upon some piece of information which would have been required to be put to an applicant under s.424A(1) for written comment. It also means that the exclusions of s.424A(3) therefore also apply as exclusions to any jurisdictional requirement to observe s.424AA as an alternative to the procedure under s.424A(1). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] FCA 1701">23 In any event, the Minister submitted that no jurisdictional error arises. Section 424AA itself imposes no obligation upon the Tribunal. It provides an alternative means by which the Tribunal may give to the applicant 'information' that it is otherwise required to give in writing pursuant to s 424A(1) of the Act. A jurisdictional error will only arise if there is a breach of s 424A ( SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 at [23] --- [28], SZLWI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [17] --- [21], SZLQD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] ). There was no 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1) , and s 424AA was not engaged. I agree with these submissions.

<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] FMCA 1572">The amended application contends that the Tribunal failed to comply with what is said to be a mandatory procedure prescribed by the Act, in failing to comply with s.424AA(b)(iv) of the Act. Section 424AA complements the Tribunal's obligations under s.424A. It does not impose a mandatory obligation on the Tribunal, insofar as that is contended for by the applicant. Rather, as indicated by Marshall J in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12], s.424AA enables the Tribunal, if it so chooses, to give to an applicant any information which the Tribunal considers would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review orally during the hearing. It does not compel the Tribunal to give an applicant any particulars of country information which it intends to rely on during the hearing. Moreover, if information is within the exceptions to s.424A , the statutory opportunity to put " information " orally under s.424AA rather than in writing under s.424A does not apply (see SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2008] FMCA 1509">But in any event, the information in question was independent country information which the Tribunal had no obligation to notify to the applicant. While recognising the binding effect on this Court of the decision of Cowdroy J in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 , the applicant reserves his position on this point for further argument on appeal. The applicant implicitly submits that the Court, were it not bound by his Honour's decision in SZLXI's case , should find that s.424A(3) does not apply to oral notifications given pursuant to s.424AA. </sentence>

If the Tribunal chooses to do so but fails to comply with the requirements of s.424AA(b) as Gilmour J stated in SZLWI at [19] "... the consequence is not that it falls into jurisdictional error " but rather that s.424A(2A) , which exempts the Tribunal from the obligation to comply with s.424A where it has given clear particulars of the information and invited the applicant to comment under s.424AA , would not apply. </sentence>

Section 424A(3) identifies material which is not 'information' for the purposes of the application of that section. However, as s.424AA is merely an alternative form of notification available to the Tribunal (see s.424A(2A)), the Court considers that the exclusions contained in s.424A(3) apply with equal force to s.424AA. Such inference is supported by the collective use of the term 'information' in s.424A(2A) of the Act (a subsection which applies to both ss.424A and 424AA), as such use implies uniformity of meaning. Section 424A(2A) provides:- 
 
 '(2A) The Tribunal is not obliged under this section to give particulars of information to an applicant, nor invite the applicant to comment on or respond to the information, if the Tribunal gives clear particulars of the information to the applicant, and invites the applicant to comment on or respond to the information, under section 424AA.
