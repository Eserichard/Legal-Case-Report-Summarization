<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] SASC 266">A ruling of a chairman may however, be subject to review if it was not made bona fide and in good faith, or was an error of law. Greenwood J in Australian Olives Ltd v Livadaras stated : [21] 
 
 The chair is required to act "bona fide" or at least in a way that is not "neglectful". On a question of whether the chair of a meeting of relevant members of a corporation, convened to consider a scheme of arrangement, had given members sufficient opportunity to debate the merits of the scheme, McLelland J, in Re Direct Acceptance Corporation Ltd (1987) 5 ACLC 1 ,037 at 1,041, said, "However, on such a matter as this, the chairman as a matter of law has a wide discretion with which the court will not interfere unless the exercise of that discretion can be shown to be invalid, for example on the ground that it was exercised in bad faith" ... It seems to follow, therefore, that a decision of the chair will be amenable to supervisory review by the courts if the chair has made a decision in bad faith.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 181">As to the costs of this application, Mr Pirrie has relied upon the orders made by Greenwood J in Australian Olives Ltd v Livadaras [2008] FCA 1407 ; (2008) 172 FCR 34. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 11">It is worth mentioning at the outset of these Reasons that many of the issues that arise in these proceedings were considered by Greenwood J in Australian Olives Ltd v Livadaras [2008] FCA 1407 ; (2008) 172 FCR 34 (" Livadaras "). That decision dealt with a similar ruling made by Mr Livadaras at a similar meeting held on 29 April 2008 in connection with a related management investment scheme: Australian Olives Project No 4. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 664">The dispute in relation to Project 4 has already been the subject of decision: see Australian Olives Ltd v Livadaras [2008] FCA 1407 ; (2008) 172 FCR 34. In that case, the meeting of members took place on 29 April 2008. The chairman of the meeting, Mr Livadaras, excluded certain votes which would have been favourable to AOL, the incumbent RE. Greenwood J rejected AOL's challenge to its removal and the appointment of Huntley based on the chairman's decision to exclude those votes and other grounds. </sentence>
