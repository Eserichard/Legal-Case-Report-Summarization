116 What a Jones v Dunkel inference does not permit is a choice between two guesses or conjectures or to supply missing gaps in evidence ( Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 446 ; (2006) 229 ALR 136 , at [50]; [2006] FCA 446). The Hon Justice Dyson Heydon, writing in Cross on Evidence , 7th Australian ed, Butterworths, 2004, at 41, in a passage endorsed by Heerey J in the Cadbury Schweppes case at [50] said that:
 
 
 
 ... while the rule in Jones v Dunkel permits an inference that the untendered evidence would not have helped the party who failed to tender it, and entitles the trier of fact to take that into account in deciding whether to accept any particular evidence which relates to a matter on which the absent witness could have spoken, and the more readily to draw any inference fairly to be drawn from the other evidence by reason of the opponent being able to prove the contrary had the party chosen to give or call evidence, the rule does not permit an inference that the untendered evidence would in fact have been damaging to the party not tendering it. The rule cannot be employed to fill gaps in the evidence, or to convert conjecture and suspicion into evidence . (my emphasis))</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] NSWSC 612">178 Relevantly, in those circumstances, what a Jones v Dunkel inference does not permit is a choice between two guesses or conjectures or to supply missing gaps in evidence ( Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 446 ; (2006) 229 ALR 136 , at [50]; [2006] FCA 446). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 23">Finally, evidence that consumers have actually been misled or deceived by the conduct complained of is not an essential element to an action in passing off or under the TPA. However, in appropriate cases, such evidence can be 'very material' and of 'some importance': see Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 389. The absence of such evidence may also be significant. As Heerey J said in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 446 ; (2006) 69 IPR 23 at [81] : 
 
 So, for almost five years, Cadbury was aware of the need for obtaining evidence to support its case, which is all about confusion in the market place. It seems unlikely that Cadbury would have been unaware of the importance of evidence of actual misleading, or that it would not have made some effort to obtain it.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FamCA 917">Secondly, the rule cannot be used to fill gaps in or deficiencies in the evidence or to convert conjecture and suspicion into inference: Jones v Dunkel at 312.5 per Menzies J; Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) 229 ALR 136 ; [2006] FCA 446 at [50] ; Cross on Evidence at [1215]. It seems to me that the husband is endeavouring to use the rule to fill a gap or deficiency in the evidence in his own case (Mr X's inability to remember, and the stark inconsistencies between the husband's evidence and Mr X's evidence), and further that the "logical explanation" theory is at best conjecture in that it is equally possible that there is other available explanation for why Mr Y did not "follow up" with Mr X (indeed, if it is the case that he did not), for example, that his retainer was completed. (See, for example, the last document in Mr Y's file, annexure MLS2 to the wife's affidavit, being a further letter 10 August 2004 from Mr Y to the wife, enclosing a copy of Mr Y's account, noting it had been paid in full and enclosing a business account receipt, which document tends to denote end of the retainer). Further, there is positive evidence from the wife to support the notion that she had no motive to contact Mr Y after she had left his office on 10 August 2004 because she did not know that she was "entitled" to receive a copy of the agreement signed by both parties or was "not quite sure" about any such entitlement: T78/5. Her positive evidence as to this thus contradicts one of the planks in the "logical explanation" theory, namely that for some reason the wife would have seen fit to communicate with Mr Y on or after 10 August 2004 to tell him that her "entitlement" was satisfied, that is, that she had been given already an original or a copy of the agreement signed by both parties, thus at once both exploding the "logical explanation" theory, and showing it to be speculative conjecture. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCAFC 8">I will refer to this decision as the evidence ruling. On 27 April 2006, the primary judge delivered his decision on the appellant's application. He decided that the application should be dismissed: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 446 ; (2006) 229 ALR 136. I will refer to this as the primary judge's substantive judgment. The appellant appealed to the Full Court of this Court against the primary judge's substantive judgment. The fact that an opinion is expressed concerning the making of consumer decisions for the purchase of every day items of commerce does not disqualify the opinion from being admissible, so long as s 79 is satisfied. 
 
 Judgment consequent upon the first hearing 
 
 The primary judge dismissed Cadbury's action ( Cadbury Schweppes v Darrell Lea (No. 4) [2006] FCA 446 ; (2006) 229 ALR 136 ; (2006) 69 IPR 23). Of particular importance in the case was the use made by Darrell Lea of darker shades of purple in the packaging of its seasonal products at Christmas in the years 2000 to 2004. His Honour found that that shade of purple was "like that used by Cadbury" and observed that if Darrell Lea's decision to adopt it had been made with the intention of misleading consumers as to an association with Cadbury, that would be strong evidence that misleading conduct in fact occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1126">3 Meanwhile Cadbury commenced the passing off action in the Federal Court. It included a claim for misleading conduct in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The action was dismissed in a judgment delivered on 27 April 2006: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 446 ; (2006) 69 IPR 23. According to the trial judge, Heerey J (at 44): "Cadbury does not own the colour purple and does not have an exclusive reputation in purple in connection with chocolate. " </sentence>

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FCAFC 119">1 Cadbury brought a proceeding in the Court in which it claimed that the use by Darrell Lea of a shade of purple in connection with its chocolate confectionary business may cause consumers to conclude, mistakenly, that Darrell Lea products are Cadbury products or that there is some connection between the respective chocolate confectionary businesses of Darrell Lea and Cadbury. A judge of the Court made orders that Cadbury's proceeding be dismissed with costs: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 446. On 21 May 2007, the Full Court upheld an appeal from those orders and set them aside on the ground that certain expert evidence that Cadbury sought to lead had been wrongly excluded: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 70.

<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCA 200">30 Dayals criticises the absence of expert evidence concerning the reputation of Natural Waters or Fiji Water and, in particular, the absence of survey evidence as to the reputation in, and public recognition of, the "constellation of features" relied upon by Natural Waters. There is no suggestion that such survey evidence was obtained and not adduced; the evidence is that Natural Waters has not engaged market research in this area. Natural Waters has adduced evidence of the sales, marketing and promotion of Fiji Water. Natural Waters submits, with reference to Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 ; (2006) 228 ALR 719 at [11] ---[12] that expert evidence of reputation or consumer association would be unhelpful and inadmissible as it could amount to no more than an opinion on a matter that is not outside the experience of ordinary persons. As a general proposition, evidence as to the reputation of an applicant's packaging or get-up in the mind of the consumer may be adduced ( Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Limited [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 387 per Gummow J with whom Black CJ and Lockhart J agreed). The evidence ruled inadmissible in Cadbury seemed to concern the likelihood of deception rather than reputation (at [5]) and evidence of consumer recognition, in the form of a "chocolate sensory study" was admitted ( Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 446 ; (2006) 229 ALR 136 at [69] ).

The claim was dismissed: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 446. Darrell Lea now seeks an order for costs on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
