<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] MRTA 2341">The question arises in this case as to whether an applicant can have his visa cancelled for breach of a condition of that visa when the conduct occurred under a previously held visa. The Tribunal notes the decision of Shek v MIMIA [2006] FCA 522 may be seen to have some application but, unlike that case, in this instance there is no overlap of conduct between the two visas. The conduct in question occurred wholly during the period of the first visa. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 1008">The reality is that the section 116 cancellation is not constrained or affected by the cancellation power under section 137J , initiated by a section 20 notice, and in that regard, the subject Tribunal's decision stands aside from those considered in Humayun v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 35 ; Shek v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 522 ; and Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Zhou [2006] FCAFC 96. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] MRTA 656">If the visa is in force at the end of the term and the applicant was in fact enrolled at the commencement of the term, even if under a different visa, as is the case in this applciation, then an assessment can be made of whether there was compliance with the attendance condition of the visa which was extant at the end of the term: Shek [2006] FCA 522 at [32] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] MRTA 235">In Shek v MIMIA [2006] FCA 522 , the wording of Condition 8202 was considered and it was found that the assessment of compliance with the condition requires an assessment to be made of attendance over the duration of 'each term'.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FMCA 1545">He submits that this application for review of the Tribunal decision is about a cancellation of the student visa under s.116. The cancellation power under s.116 is separate to, and cannot be constrained by, the cancellation power under s.137J which is initiated by a s.20 Notice. This is made clear in the Full Federal Court decisions of Humayun v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 35 ( Humayun ); Minister for Immigration v Zhou [2006] FCAFC 96 ( Zhou ); Shek v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 522 ( Shek ). It is submitted that the only relationship between s.137J and s.116 is the factual basis which grounds the cancellation. In Zhou , the Court accepted the Minister's argument that "a mere factual, casual, connection between a s.20 notice and the initiation of the cancellation process under s.116 of the Act cannot affect the validity of a decision mandated by the latter section": at [27].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] MRTA 446">The Tribunal notes that in Shek v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 522 (8 May 2006) Siopis J held that subclause 8202(3)(a)(ii), which is the current equivalent of subclause 8202(3)(c)(ii) which is before the Tribunal, provides that where a course runs for at least a semester the attendance requirement is necessary for each term or semester of the course.
