<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 62">Mr Stack submitted that this showed that the Court of Appeal treated the charges of contempt as being made in civil proceedings. The issue to which these observations went was whether for the charges to be established it was necessary that particulars of the charge be made out in their entirety, or whether only those elements of the charges necessary to establish breach of the relevant orders needed to be established (at [67]). There was no issue before the court whether the proceedings were " civil proceedings " or " criminal proceedings " within the meaning of the Civil Procedure Act . The same is true of the other authorities relied on by Mr Stack ( Energiser Australia Pty Ltd v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd (No 4) [2008] FCA 864 at [13] - [14]; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Reid [2006] FCA 699 at [18] ,[21]; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Matthews [2000] NSWSC 201 at [13]). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1133">During the course of argument I was referred to various authorities concerned with O 62A r 1 or similar provisions in other jurisdictions. These included Sacks v Permanent Trustee Australia Limited [1993] FCA 502 ; (1993) 45 FCR 509 (Beazley J), Woodlands v Permanent Trustee Company Limited [1995] FCA 1388 ; (1995) 58 FCR 139 (Wilcox J), Hanisch v Strive Pty Ltd [1997] FCA 303 ; (1997) 74 FCR 384 (Drummond J), Blue Mountains Conservation Society Inc v Delta Electricity [2009] NSWLEC 150 ; (2009) 170 LGERA 1 (Pain J), Corcoran v Virgin Blue Airlines Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 864 (Bennett J) and Caroona Coal Action Group Inc v Coal Miners Australia Pty Ltd [2009] NSWLEC 165 ; (2009) 170 LGERA 22 (Preston CJ). The applicant has since drawn my attention to the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Delta Electricity v Blue Mountains Conservation Society Inc [2010] NSWCA 263 dismissing (by majority) an appeal from the decision of Pain J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] NSWCA 263">37 Her Honour acknowledged that the question of costs was generally considered at the end of the hearing, at which time a decision could be made as to whether a public interest consideration was to apply to any costs order. However, as her Honour observed, an order under UCPR, r 42.4 could be sought at any time in the proceedings, and held that an order under UCPR, r 42.4 could be made in public interest cases: see R (on the application of Corner House Research) v The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [2005] EWCA Crim 3093 ; [2005] 4 All ER 1 ( Corner House ) at [74]; and Corcoran v Virgin Blue Airlines Proprietary Limited [2008] FCA 864 at [6] . Her Honour considered that the factors referred to in those decisions provided a useful guide as to the relevant criteria that ought to be considered in this case. 


 
189 In a more recent decision, Corcoran v Virgin Blue Airlines Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 864 at [6] - [13], Bennett J identified a wide variety of factors which might need to be taken into account in appropriate cases under O 62A. A helpful exposition of relevant considerations in a public law context may be found in the judgment of Preston CJ in Caroona Coal Action Group Inc v Coal Mines Australia Pty Ltd [2009] NSWLEC 165 ; 170 LGERA 22. As noted by Preston CJ at [12], under r 42.4, it is a matter for the Court to specify the party which is protected by a maximum costs order: there is no requirement that the order apply equally to all parties. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 616">The factors relevant to the exercise of discretion in making an order under O 62A rule 1 were considered by Bennett J in Corcoran v Virgin Blue Airlines Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 864 at [6] . These factors include the following: The timing of the application ( Sacks v Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [1993] FCA 502 ; (1993) 45 FCR 509 at 511 per Beazley J; Flew v Mirvac Parking Pty Ltd [2006] FMCA 1818 at [48] per Barnes FM; Minns v State of NSW No. 2) [2002] FMCA 197 at [9] per Raphael FM]); The complexity of the factual or legal issues raised in the proceedings ([ Hanisch v Strive Pty Ltd [1997] FCA 303] at 387 per Drummond J; Dibb v Avco Financial Services Limited [2000] FCA 1785 at [15] per Sackville J); The amount of damages that the applicant seeks to recover ( Hanisch at 387) and the extent of any other remedies sought ( Flex at [48]); Whether the applicant's claims are arguable and not frivolous or vexatious ( Flew at [15]); The undesirability of forcing the applicant to abandon the proceedings ( Woodlands v Permanent Trustee Company Limited [1995] FCA 1388 ; (1995) 58 FCR 139 at 148 per Wilcox J; Flex at [9]); and Whether there is a public interest element to the case ( Woodlands at 146; Flew at [23], [47]). 
The cases cited by Bennett J indicate that an order capping costs will generally be made in cases where the issues involved are not of any particular complexity and the amounts sought to be recovered are modest. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] NSWLEC 165">26 Public interest litigation cases in which a form of a maximum costs order has been made include: Corcoran v Virgin Blue Airlines Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 864 ; R (On the Application of Corner House Research) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry ; R (On the Application of Buglife: The Invertebrate Conservation Trust) v Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corp [2008] EWCA Civ 1209 ; [2009] Env LR 18 ; [2009] JPL 1045; and Blue Mountains Conservation Society Inc v Delta Electricity [2009] NSWLEC 150.  49 Secondly, the second respondent submits the underlying rationale for the rule in r 42.4 is that "in a particular case the possibility of a potentially ruinous costs order may prove too much of a deterrent for a litigant seeking to vindicate a legitimate claim" (at [5]). The second respondent continues that:
 
"6 It is in that context that an assertion that a matter involves the resolution of 'public interest issues' needs to be considered as a factor only . The rationale for considering whether a case presents a true issue of 'public interest' for resolution is that, if it does, then that is a reason for allowing the proceedings to go forward so that the Plaintiffs and other members of the public can derive the benefits that flow from the resolution of that issue (see Woodlands v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd &amp; Ors [1995] FCA 1388 ; (1995) 58 FCR 139 at 148). Thus in Woodland the proceedings involved a class action, the resolution of which was potentially beneficial to 'many thousands of people' ( id ). Similarly in Corcoran v Virgin Blue Airlines Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 864 the determination of the claim of discrimination in that case had the potential to benefit a potentially wide group of air travellers in circumstances where the cost of the proceedings would be disproportionate to any benefit the individual Plaintiffs would derive.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] NSWLEC 150">24 Protective costs orders have been made in the Federal Court under Federal Court Rules 1979 order 62A r 1 (in similar terms to UCPR r 42.4) by Wilcox J in Woodlands v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1995] FCA 1388 ; (1995) 58 FCR 139 and by Bennett J in Corcoran v Virgin Blue Airlines Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 864. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 1340">2) [2004] FCA 594 Heerey J explicitly rejected the argument that normal costs principles should not apply to cases brought under the HREOC Act and affirmed the general rule that a wholly successful defendant should receive his or her costs unless good reason is shown to the contrary [8]. A factor that may warrant a departure from the usual rule that costs will follow the event is in cases where there is a significant public interest element (Federal Discrimination Law (HREOC page 387)). In Tom Ferguson v Virgin Blue Airlines Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 864 Bennett J set the maximum costs that could be awarded against the unsuccessful applicant in that human rights matter. In Pitt v One Steel Reinforcing Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 923 Justice Gray ordered the unsuccessful applicant to pay the respondent's costs in that human rights matter. In Rana v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 907 Lander J awarded costs against the unsuccessful applicant in that human rights matter that was found to be an abuse of process, and the applicant had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding.</sentence>
