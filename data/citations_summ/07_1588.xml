<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 217">The Tribunal's obligation is not limited to procedural fairness in responding to expressly articulated claims but, as is apparent from Dranichnikov , extends to reviewing the delegate's decision on the basis of all the materials before it. 

 
 [62] Whatever the scope of the Tribunal's obligations it is not required to consider criteria for an application never made. ... 

 
In MZXLB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1588 at [14] , Finkelstein J referred to NABE and observed that " (t)here is no precise standard for determining when an issue is 'raised squarely', but it is clear the tribunal is obliged to consider any claim that is apparent on the face of the material before it ". See also: SZEIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798 at [30] to [31] and [56] to [57] per Bennett J; SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 599 ; Kasupene v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1609. That which is not to be permitted is for a claimant to " reformulate his claims on an ex post facto basis ": SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [23] , 171 FCR 134 at 140 per Gilmour J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1609">20 But it is not a line to be drawn so as to impose upon the Tribunal any general duty to itself secure evidence which has not been otherwise adduced or any general duty to pursue submissions not otherwise advanced. The need to inquire into facts not otherwise before the Tribunal may not be confined to those facts going to jurisdiction, as in Kuswardana ; but should be confined to facts of central importance to the decision to be made: cf Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155. And the need to consider submissions or issues not raised by the parties may equally normally be confined to those submissions which are submissions of substance which emerge from the factual material before the Tribunal: cf NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 , 144 FCR 1. It was said there that a " judgment that the Tribunal has failed to consider a claim not expressly advanced is ... not lightly to be made. The claim must emerge clearly from the materials before the Tribunal ": at [68]. See also: SZITR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1759 at [50] , 44 AAR 382 at 397 per Moore J; MZXMG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1884 at [13] ---[14] per Middleton J. In MZXLB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1588 at [14] Finkelstein J referred to NABE and observed that there " is no precise standard for determining when an issue is 'raised squarely', but it is clear the tribunal is obliged to consider any claim that is apparent on the face of the material before it ".</sentence>
