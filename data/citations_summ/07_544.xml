<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 709">18 Hotchkin Hanley did not respond to ASIC's letter of 8 March 2007. Ferrier Hodgson responded but did not pursue its previous concerns. Mr Carey and Ms Carey, through their solicitors Mony de Kerloy, wrote to ASIC on 9 March 2007 asserting that the Westpoint documents might contain legally privileged information and that to obtain appropriate advice their clients required funding from moneys held by Healthcare Properties Pty Ltd (Healthcare). ASIC rejected this contention on 13 March 2007. An application for release of funds from Healthcare was refused in my judgment on 17 April 2007: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission; In the matter of Richstar Enterprises Ltd v Carey (No 15) [2007] FCA 544. </sentence>
