<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 724">20 Section 723 of the Act does not impose an obligation to lodge a quotation application within seven days of the date of a prospectus. Strictly speaking, read with s 724, it simply attaches certain consequences to the failure to do so. Nevertheless, s 1322(4)(d) has been construed as authorising an extension of the seven day period specified in s 723(3)(b): Re Insurance Australia Group Ltd [2003] FCA 581 ; (2003) 128 FCR 581 at [26] - [29]; Re Wave Capital Ltd (2003) 47 ACSR 418 at [30]; Re Tony Barlow Australia Ltd [2005] FCA 363 ; (2005) 53 ACSR 1 at [20] - [21] ; In the Matter of Geopacific Resources NL [2007] FCA 43 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 226 [16].</sentence>
