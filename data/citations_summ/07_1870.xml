<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 156">I should also make the point that although in this case the Tribunal sent a letter to the appellants after the hearing pursuant to s 424A of the Act, that fact cannot overcome any failure to accord procedural fairness at the hearing: SZIOZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1870 at [59] ; SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911 ; (2008) 102 ALD 598 at 611 [56] .  The question arises as to whether this letter, sent by the second Tribunal to the appellant after the hearing, satisfies its s 425 obligations. In SZIOZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1870 the Tribunal sent a letter to an applicant after the hearing advising that a certain fact was in issue. The Tribunal had not advised the applicant that this fact was in issue during the hearing. Besanko J held (at [59]) that this sort of letter cannot satisfy the provisions of s 425(1) of the Act. Rares J came to the same conclusion in SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) (2008) 102 ALD 598 ; [2008] FCA 911 at [56] . I respectfully agree with these conclusions The second Tribunal did not inform the appellants of the central and determinative issues in the review
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1246">The applicant submitted that the Tribunal is obliged to identify to an applicant the issues which would be dispositive of the review, at least to the extent that an issue was not an issue before the delegate. He also submitted that any such issue must be identified at or prior to a hearing and that if such an issue arises after the hearing, a further hearing is to be held. The applicant referred to SZIOZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1870 where Besanko J said at [59]: The letter from the Tribunal sent after the hearing, it seems with its obligation in s 424A in mind, raises that issue but a letter after the hearing cannot satisfy the provisions of s 425(1) of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1692">It is clear that the delegate roundly disbelieved that the Applicant had converted to Christianity. This was a case where "the delegate rejected every aspect of an Applicant's claim" (see SZIOZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1870 (" SZIOZ ") at [56] per Besanko J). All matters in issue before the delegate were, in the circumstances of this particular case, in issue before the Tribunal (see SZIOZ at [56]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 942">If the reconstituted tribunal proposed or envisaged revisiting one or other of the issues previously resolved in favour of the appellant such a course would attract the obligation imposed by s.425(1). " [emphasis added] 

That was not the case here as the delegate did not make a positive finding about the applicant's claims regarding the DVDs or the Nine Commentaries. In SZIOZ v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1870 (" SZIOZ ") the delegate had concluded that at the most, the appellant was a practitioner of Falun Gong only and had no profile in China, and then found that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution. The dispositive issue in the Tribunal's decision was the claim that the appellant was a Falun Gong practitioner ( SZIOZ at [57]). Besanko J found that this amounted to a breach of s.425 and continued: 
 
 "[59] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 911">56 But moreover, it found, as a fact that '... it does not accept that she is currently a genuine practitioner' (my emphasis). There is nothing in her claim for a protection visa, the delegate's decision, or in the tribunal's statement of decision and reasons which put the appellant on notice before the tribunal's decision was made that the appellant had engaged in conduct here to strengthen her claim and that such conduct, went to her credibility. Nor could the s 424A letter that was sent after the hearing raise any new issue so as to satisfy the requirement in s 425(1) that the tribunal invite the applicant for review to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review: SZIOZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1870 at [59] per Besanko J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 2009">He submitted that this is an argument currently under consideration on appeal before the Federal Court ( SZIOZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (" SZIOZ ")) (NSD 203 of 2007)), and that if this issue was to be determinative of the matter before this Court, then this Court could await the handing down of this judgment. I note that at the time of the handing down of this judgment, that judgment has just been handed down in SZIOZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1870. While the Court found for the applicant, the Court did so on the basis of a ground other than in relation to s.424A. But in any event, I do not see this issue as being determinative of the applicant's complaint, given what I have said above about the application of what the High Court said in SZBYR to this case. </sentence>
