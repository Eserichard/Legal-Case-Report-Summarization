<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 740">In relation to the assets of those respondents and also the fifth respondent referred to in a Notice of Motion filed 11 May 2009, freezing orders have been sought by the applicant under Order 25A rules 5(4) and 5(5) of the Federal Court Rules to prevent an abuse or frustration of the process of the Court in respect of the primary claims for relief. In relation to applications such as this, I would refer to the applicable principles as summarised by me in Ron Medich Properties Pty Ltd v Bentley-Smythe Pty Ltd (No. 3) [2009] FCA 335 ('Medich') at [10]-[24]. None of the parties to whom this judgment relates submit that the summary of the principles in Medich contains any errors. </sentence>
