<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1464">The law on what constitutes a "market in Australia" is far from settled. One thing that is clear is that a market which is wholly outside Australia is not comprehended by the statutory definition: see Singapore Airlines Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCAFC 136 ; (2009) 260 ALR 244 at 254; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1976 ; (2008) 253 ALR 89 at 112. The existence of a global market which extends into the geographic boundaries of Australia does not, on the other hand, preclude a finding that there exists a "market in Australia". There can, therefore, be no objection to the applicant pleading, as it has done, that there is a global market for air freight services and that part of that market is a "market in Australia", provided that material facts are pleaded which establish the existence of those markets: see Sammy Rosso Supplies Pty Ltd v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-641 at 41-094 per Goldberg J. </sentence>

These included the propositions that: the Court is not obliged to commence its reasoning with the level of the agreed penalty and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the range; the Court is entitled to address the question independently at the outset of its reasoning; the admissions and agreed facts should not be approached as if they had been "tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the [regulator] in proving its case"; the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning said to justify a discounted penalty. </sentence>

Much has been said in the authorities about the need to deter conduct which is antithetical to the promotion of competition and the seriousness of Parliament's intentions in that respect: NW Frozen Foods at 293---294; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Limited [2001] FCA 383 ; (2001) ATPR 41-815 at [13] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 329 at [22]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) [2005] FCA 265 ; (2005) 215 ALR 301 at [39] . As Lindgren J observed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1976 ; (2008) 253 ALR 89 at [25] , the principles governing the imposition of penalties for contravention of Part IV should be considered in light of the most recent Full Court pronouncement in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 ; (2004) ATPR 41-993. In that case, at [51], the Full Court listed six propositions that emerge from NW Frozen Foods . They were listed by Lindgren J in Qantas at [26] as follows:- 
 (i) It is the responsibility of the court to determine the appropriate penalty; 
 (ii) Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science and the courts have acknowledged that within a permissible range, a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another;
 (iii) There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation, particularly where it is likely to be lengthy;
 (iv) The view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is relevant, but not determinative, and its views on matters within its expertise will usually be given greater weight than its views on more "subjective" matters;
 (v) The court examines all the circumstances of the case, and where the parties have advanced an agreed statement of facts, the court may act on it if it is appropriate to do so; and
 (vi) Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty, it is not useful to investigate whether the court would have arrived at that precise figure; the figure will be appropriate if within the permissible range.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FCA 312">The notion of a 'market in Australia' was recently referred to by Lindgren J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1976 , where his Honour stated (at [33]-[34]): 
 Although the notion of a "market in Australia" in s 4E has been referred to in two cases ( Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] per Hill J and Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2008) ATPR 42-256 at [19] per Tracey J), the concept has not been the subject of extensive judicial consideration. 

 
 In Riverstone , Hill J rejected the proposition that in order to be a "market in Australia" a market must be wholly within Australia. His Honour said (at [21]) that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products. As the Commission points out, a contrary view would considerably reduce the efficacy and utility of the competition law provisions of the Act, especially in the modern telecommunications era. 
  Justice Lindgren went on to conclude that the definition of "market in Australia" in s 4E excludes a market that is wholly outside Australia, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree. As other aspects of the decision in Qantas [2008] FCA 1976 proceeded upon agreed facts, however, that case provides little assistance in determining the other issues raised before me which involved 'a concrete dispute reached after contest in argument': see Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at [62] (per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FCA 263">Section 76 relevantly provides as follows:
 
 (1) If the Court is satisfied that a person: 
 (a) has contravened any of the following provisions: 
 (i) a provision of Part IV ...; [or] 
 ... 
 (b) has attempted to contravene such a provision; 
 ... 
 the Court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty, in respect of each act or omission by the person to which this section applies, as the Court determines to be appropriate having regard to all relevant matters including the nature and extent of the act or omission and of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission, the circumstances in which the act or omission took place and whether the person has previously been found by the Court in proceedings under this Part or Part XIB to have engaged in any similar conduct. 

 
 (1A) The pecuniary penalty payable under subsection (1) by a body corporate is not to exceed ... for each [relevant] act or omission ...---$10,000,000. 

 The principles regarding the imposition of pecuniary penalties, including penalties jointly proposed by the parties, were recently considered by Lindgren J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd [[2008] FCA 1976 at [16]- [27] ] and Finkelstein J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Oobi Baby Pty Ltd [[2008] FCA 1488 at [9]]. Finkelstein J summarises the position as follows: 
 
 So far as the penalties were concerned many cases have examined the Court's task in considering a joint position on penalties. The applicable principles are authoritatively dealt with in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [ [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 ] and Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd . A third reason is that a powerful supplier may insist that minimum prices be imposed on its retail goods. Yet another view is that resale price maintenance inevitably eliminates dealer competition with the undesirable consequence that consumers are limited in the range of choices they have with respect to price. 

 The contraventions the subject of this proceeding are serious, and deterrence, which is the "principal object of imposing a penalty under section 76"[ Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1976 at [20] per Lindgren J], requires a significant penalty to be imposed. This Court has to deal with the present application according to law. The above observations which I have quoted recognise that.</sentence>
