But this was a case in which a whole ground of fear had not been taken into consideration by the Tribunal. After expressing in terms which it is worth recalling at [46 and 47] the general principles that a court should look at when considering whether or not the failure to consider a piece of evidence constitutes jurisdictional error the court said at [48]: "[48] In the present case it was clearly a significant element of the appellant's application before the Tribunal that the marriage of his son S to a Muslim woman would have repercussions for him and his wife upon their return to Iran. It is also clear that he was contending that these repercussions would amount to persecution for a Convention reason. That is to say the religion of S and his wife ... [49] The material put before the Tribunal on the son's inter-marriage issue and the contentions advanced in respect of it went directly to the criteria for the grant of a protection visa set out in s.36. While the Tribunal recounted the appellant's claims on this issue earlier in its reasons, its failure to consider the evidence and the contention leads to the inescapable conclusion that it failed to address the issue.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 819">It is only failure to have regard to evidence that may amount to jurisdictional error and not a failure to discuss each piece of evidence with the Applicant. The Court was referred to the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in WAFP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [12] , also the decision of Jacobson J in Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [13] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 583">First, the Tribunal is not required in its written reasons to deal with every piece of evidence that might be thought to be relevant ( SZEHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1389 , per Lindgren J and authorities there cited, Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1113). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 233">It is well established that the Tribunal need not uncritically accept an applicant's claims: Randhawa v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 437 at 451. To the extend that the applicant's complaint may be construed as a complaint that the Tribunal failed to consider evidence that would support findings contrary to those ultimately made by the Tribunal, this complaint is not made out. First, the Tribunal is not required in its written reasons to deal with every piece of evidence that might be thought to be relevant: SZEHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1389 , per Lindgren J and authorities there cited, Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1113. Second, the Tribunal is not required to make findings on each piece of evidence before it, nor to refer to each individual piece of evidence to demonstrate that it has taken into account the fact or facts to which the evidence refers: Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf (2001) 206 CLR 323 ; [2001] HCA 30 at [68] , [73]-[74] and [91], Applicant A169/2003 v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 8 at [24] , WAEE v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 ; [2003] FCAFC 184 at [47] , Paul v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 113 FCR 396 ; [2001] FCA 1196. Third, in my view, having regard to the Tribunal's reasons for decision, and on a plain reading of it, there is no suggestion that the Tribunal failed to undertake a "proper, genuine and realistic consideration [of] the merits of the case": SZEJF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 724 at [39] , per Rares J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 1507">However it may be noted that even if the report had been overlooked by the Tribunal that would not demonstrate jurisdictional error. There is a distinction between failing to take account of a claim and failing to take into account individual items of evidence. Only the former suffices to establish jurisdictional error: Singh v MIMIA [2006] FCA 1113 (Jacobson J) at [21-36]; SZHPI v MIAC [2008] FCA 306 (Branson J) at [15]. The report here is plainly in the latter category (as was found to be the doctor's report in Singh ). Consideration

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 306">15 It would have been desirable for the Tribunal to deal explicitly with the earlier qualification that the appellant placed on his evidence and its failure to do so leaves one with a sense of unease. Nonetheless, the authorities make it clear that the Tribunal is not required to deal in its written reasons for decision with every piece of evidence that might be thought relevant (see particularly, the authorities cited by Lindgren J in SZEHN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1389 and Jacobson J in Singh v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1113). The appellant placed reliance on WAFP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 319. As Jacobson J explained in Singh at [25], WAFP is not to be understood as having elevated a failure to refer to relevant evidence to a ground of jurisdictional error; it was concerned with relevant material which it described as so fundamental as to go to jurisdiction. The appellant's answers in this case do not have this fundamental character.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 133">Mr Johnson further submits that a distinction between relevant and irrelevant material should not be blurred. In MZWBW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 94 at [26] , Black CJ, Sundberg and Bennett JJ stated: 26 In Rezaei v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1294 Allsop J said that Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs vYusuf (2001) 206 CLR 231: "does not stand for the proposition that a relevant consideration has not been taken into account and the decision-maker thereby has failed to embark on or complete his or her jurisdictional task merely because some piece of evidence which the court thinks is relevant in the evidential or probative sense can be seen not to have been weighed or discussed. 'Relevant' for this purpose means that the decision-maker is bound by the statute or by law to take this into account. " This passage was approved by Cooper and Finkelstein JJ in Thirukkumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 268 at [29] . 
See also Singh v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1113 per Jacobsen J at [23]-[35] and [39]-[41]. </sentence>

 43. Further, in support of the distinction, Mr Johnson referred to: 
 
 
 1) Jacobson J in Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1113 (at [22]-[35] and [39]-[42]),
 2) MZXGP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1314 , per Middleton J at [14]:
 "Failure to deal with a particular piece of evidence is neither a failure to take into account a relevant consideration, nor a failure to deal with a relevant claim. " 
 3) Mayadeen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1522 , per Heerey J for the proposition that any failure to deal with the letter in question "would amount to no more than a defect in the fact finding process" and not a jurisdictional error. </sentence>
