<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 819">I form this view for the following reasons: As I have already found in the context of O 15A r 6, I am not satisfied on the material before me that there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court. I have already observed that the standard of satisfaction required by O 15A r 6 is lower than that of a prima facie case. It follows that, similarly, the applicant has not established a prima facie case against the fourth respondent, in the sense that the applicant has not lead evidence which is sufficient to support its allegations and which will lead to judgment in its favour unless there is evidence which rebuts those allegations ( KGL Health [2007] FCA 1410 at [9] ). Even if I were satisfied that the applicant had a prima facie case against the fourth respondent, I am not persuaded that there is any risk of frustration or inhibition of the Court's process such as to justify a freezing order as sought by the applicant. The events complained of by the applicant occurred two years ago. Key aspects of the application of O 25A r 2 include: Exercising the power conferred by O 25A r 2 is at the discretion of the Court. The applicant must establish a prima facie cause of action against the respondent to warrant exercise of the power ( KGL Health Pty Ltd v Mechtler [2007] FCA 1410 at [4] - [5], Patterson v BTR Engineering (Aust) Limited (1989) 18 NSWLR 319 at 321-322). The Court must be satisfied that there is a danger that the prospective judgment of the Court will be wholly or partly unsatisfied because the respondent's assets could be disposed of, dealt with or diminished. A freezing order should be viewed as an extraordinary interim remedy because it can restrict the right to deal with assets even before judgment ( KGL Health [2007] FCA 1410).  There is no suggestion by the applicant that these activities constitute dissipation of assets --- indeed the progress of these activities is anticipated by the revised draft freezing order. I note the evidence of Ms Cooley that a freezing order on her assets would stifle the growth of the new business operated by Mr Cartan and herself (affidavit of Jennifer Cooley sworn 23 July 2009 para 25). This impact on an unrelated business of Mr Cartan and Ms Cooley in my view is a factor I should take into consideration, in the sense that the freezing order is a "substantial encroachment on the basic right and freedom of the respondent to deal with ... her property" ( KGL Health [2007] FCA 1410 at [12] ).  Key aspects of the application of O 25A r 2 include: Exercising the power conferred by O 25A r 2 is at the discretion of the Court. The applicant must establish a prima facie cause of action against the respondent to warrant exercise of the power ( KGL Health Pty Ltd v Mechtler [2007] FCA 1410 at [4] - [5], Patterson v BTR Engineering (Aust) Limited (1989) 18 NSWLR 319 at 321-322). The Court must be satisfied that there is a danger that the prospective judgment of the Court will be wholly or partly unsatisfied because the respondent's assets could be disposed of, dealt with or diminished. A freezing order should be viewed as an extraordinary interim remedy because it can restrict the right to deal with assets even before judgment ( KGL Health [2007] FCA 1410). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 611">In KGL Health Pty Ltd v Mechtler [2007] FCA 1410 at [12] , Tamberlin J noted: 
 The protection afforded by a preservation order to an applicant is a substantial encroachment on the basic right and freedom of the respondent to deal with his or her property. Practice Note 23 emphasises this point when it states that the purpose of the order is to prevent abuse of process and not to provide security in respect of the judgment. The restraint must be regarded as an extraordinary remedy because it restricts the right to deal with property even before judgment. This level of interference confirms the necessity of the person seeking the freezing order to provide sufficient oral or documentary evidence of his or her prima facie case. The mere making of allegations in correspondence or the assertion of a case in a Statement of Claim is not of itself ... sufficient to make out a good arguable case. [emphasis in original]

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 404">14 In relation to the absence of the lawyer's certificate, it is said that that is of no remaining significance as the cross-claim was filed by a solicitor on behalf of Meribal, thus, carrying with it the same assurance. Such a serious misstatement can hardly be swept aside in that fashion but, in any event, there is no explanation as to how, on the basis of the normal solicitor's assurance, a claim could be valued fully without discount to reflect the chances of failure and for costs ( KGL Health Pty Ltd v Mechtler [2007] FCA 1410). Counsel for Vatera points out that the only particularised claim at that time was $270,000. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 273">2 The background to and nature of the principal proceedings in this matter are set out in a previous judgment given by me in relation to an application by the applicants for an asset preservation order: see KGL Health Pty Limited v Mechtler [2007] FCA 1410. I will not reiterate those matters.</sentence>
