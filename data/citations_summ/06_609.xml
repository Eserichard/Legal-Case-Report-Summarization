Justice Heerey in SZCJD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 609 discussed s.424A(3)(b) applying to exclude the operation of s.424A(1) because details of the visa application in that case were discussed with the applicant at that Tribunal hearing. His Honour stated at [40]-[43]: [40] In any case, I do not accept the appellant's argument that the Tribunal contravened s 424A(1) at the time it sent the 23 September letter.

In that case, the Tribunal described the applicant's claims (from his original visa application) of association with the Awami League as vague and lacking in details. It then questioned the applicant about his involvement with that organisation.

Further, I note submissions by Mr Johnson today and agree with him that to the extent that it could be said that the Tribunal relied on information arising by way of "cross-examination" of the applicant at the hearing before the Tribunal, then this is information falling within that exception from the obligation pursuant to s.424A(1) of the Act ( SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 , SZJCD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 609). </sentence>

Whilst the Tribunal did, in its findings and reasons, at page 75 of the Court Book, refer to a statement in the Applicant's Protection visa application, this information was canvassed at the hearing with the Applicant and the Applicant expanded on it. Accordingly, that information falls within the exception contained in sub-section 424A(3)(b). This information is information given at the hearing for the purpose of the application and I am referred to the decision in SZCJD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 609 at [42] .

 57 In SZCJD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 609 ('SZCJD'), Heerey J said at [42] that the exception in s.424(3)(b) would apply to information which is affirmed by an applicant for the purposes of the review, even if the information might also have been obtained by the Tribunal from another source.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 826">45 As Young J noted in NBKT at [55], the Full Court's approach in SZEEU to issues of this kind must also take into account its treatment of a similar question in the appeal in SZDXA , also reported with SZEEU . The relevant information in SZDXA was the fact that the appellant had a temporary business visa to Australia. Moore J concluded that, although the Tribunal had acquired this information from sources other than the appellant, the Tribunal had discussed the fact with the appellant at the hearing and the appellant had affirmed that he had entered Australia on a business visa. In this circumstance, Moore J concluded, at 242, that the information fell within 424A(3)(b) and Weinberg J agreed, at 254, observing, at 255, that the adoption of an earlier statement at the hearing can bring that statement within the exception. Allsop J agreed, at 268, with Moore J in relation to SZDXA . The Full Court in NBKT reached a similar conclusion in relation to the information in question in that case: see NBKT at [60]-[63] per Young J. See also SZCJD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 609 at [43] per Heerey J; and SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] per Kenny J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 792">11 Third alleged breach: The contradiction between the protection visa application and oral evidence about the circumstances surrounding the giving of a public address by 'C. '
 
 His Honour determined in relation to the second and third potential breaches that the information did not form part of the reasons for affirming the decision of the delegate and that, therefore, it was not comprehended by s 424A(1) of the Act . It was the answers provided by the appellant to questions about being general secretary of the Chatra League and the speech which led the Tribunal to reject his claims in this regard. The Federal Magistrate referred to the decision of Heerey J in SZCJD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 609 at [40] --- [43] explaining that s. 424A(3)(b) applied to exclude the operation of s 424A(1) because details of the visa application were discussed with the applicant at the Tribunal hearing. His Honour determined that the various inconsistencies and implausibilities emerged from the questioning of the appellant during the hearing. No jurisdictional error was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FMCA 656">In the event that there had been some prior provision of this information to the department, authorities such as Goo v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 391 , SZCJD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 609 , SZESF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 6 indicate that the repetition of such information at the Tribunal hearing brings it within the reach of s.424A(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 472">It is now settled in this Court that information which is given orally in a hearing before the RRT, whether volunteered or in answer to a request for confirmation of material before the RRT in some other form (e.g. an original application for the visa in question) is to be regarded as 'information ... that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application' (i.e. the application for review) and hence within the exception in s 424A(3)(b) to the requirement in s 424A(1) and (2) that it be given to an applicant in writing and his comments invited (see SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ) [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at 242 [91] , 254 [173] and 268 [264], SZCJD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 609 at [42] - [43], SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] and NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 at [59] - [60], SZHFC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1359 [24]. 11 In the present case, confirmation at the outset that the matters advanced in the visa application and the accompanying statement were true and correct and still relied upon was a basic starting point for the discussion which followed. The allegation of a breach of s 424A of the Act therefore cannot be made out.</sentence>

His Honour referred to Moore J's reasons in SZEEU at 242 [91], with whom Weinberg J at 254 [173] and Allsop J at 268 [264] agreed. In circumstances where the information is necessarily within the knowledge of the applicant himself, his Honour held at [43] that:
 
 'To conclude that an applicant "gave" information for the purpose of the Tribunal application it is not necessary that the information was initially volunteered by the applicant. Information is equally given if it comes in response to questioning by the Tribunal. ' 


There is no inconsistency between this approach and SZEEU : see also SZHFC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1359 at [24] - [25]. 21 The appellant submitted that this Court should adopt Heerey J's approach to the grant of leave to raise a s 424A claim in VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ( 'VWBF' ) at [23]:
 
 '[T]here is [a] question whether leave should be granted to raise this point, which was not argued before the Magistrate. For the reasons given in SZCJD [2006] FCA 609 at [19] , I think the appellant should have leave. The operation of s 424A has been the subject of a recent Full Court decision handed down on 24 February 2006, SZEEU [2006] FCAFC 2. In that case there crystallised for the first time at Full Court level what Weinberg J at [121] described as the "unanticipated but potent combination" of the Full Court's decision in Al Shamry (2001) 110 FCR 27 and the High Court's decision in SAAP (2005) 215 ALR 162. It may be true, as counsel for the Minister in the present case pointed out, that there were single judge decisions in June and July 2005 which considered this point, and the hearing before the Magistrate took place on 7 September 2005. Nevertheless some reasonable allowance should be made for the blizzard of cases concerning the Act that descend upon the profession and some time allowed before they can be taken as absorbed into the general understanding, even of those specialising in this area.
