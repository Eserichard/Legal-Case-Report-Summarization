<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 369">There is now a body of authority in this Court in which final injunctions limited as to time have been granted (see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Wizard Mortgage Corporation Ltd [2002] FCA 1317 ; [2002] ATPR 41-903 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Signature Security Group Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 375 ; [2003] ATPR 41-942 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v George Weston Foods Ltd [2004] FCA 1093 ; (2004) 210 ALR 486 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 683 ; [2005] ATPR 42-070 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777 ; (2006) 157 FCR 162 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 1546 ; [2007] ATPR 42-192 ; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1976 ; (2008) 253 ALR 89). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1976">Finally, in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 1546 ; (2007) ATPR 42-192 , his Honour had to consider a proposed four year time limit. Of this limit, his Honour said (at [8]): 
It provides a limit to the remedy of contempt of Court for breach. More particularly, it sets a period during which the party restrained will have a very powerful incentive to ensure that there is no further contravening conduct. By the end of that period it is to be hoped that the procedures and, perhaps, the culture of the organisation will be such that further contravention is unlikely. It seems to me that the undertakings which have been obtained in relation to compliance programs are appropriate for that purpose.
