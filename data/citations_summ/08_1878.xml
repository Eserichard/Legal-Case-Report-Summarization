<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 18">The practice of this Court, on one possible view, appears to have departed from the terms of the rules in two ways which are pertinent. First, it has on occasions been assumed that the procedure of a notice of objection to competency is available in s 44 appeals: Alexakis v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1878 at [1] and [28] per Jacobson J; Burgess v Secretary, Department of Families Housing Community Services and Indigenous Affairs [2009] FCA 861 at [10]- [11] per Graham J. Secondly, one view of the same decision is that a notice of object to competency is a species of application by which proceedings may be dismissed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 124">1 By Notice of Appeal filed on 9 January 2009, Mr Alexakis ('the appellant') appeals from the decision of the primary judge delivered on 12 December 2008 in Alexakis v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1878 ('the decision'). The decision was made in proceedings instituted by the appellant arising out of a reduction in his social security payments in consequence of him having received compensation, as defined in s 17(2)(b) of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth). </sentence>
