<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1236">The failure on the part of Chalice to issue the Notice was due to inadvertence and not through any act of dishonesty or wilful intention not to issue the Notice. I accept the explanation as to the other extraordinary activities at the time which gave rise to the oversight. Inadvertence has its normal meaning as suggested in the authorities, for example, Blaze Asset Pty Ltd v Target Energy Limited [2009] FCA 698 per Barker J (at [35]). On the basis of the evidence and applying some common sense, it is plain that the oversight in failing to give the requisite Notice was caused by inadvertence. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 955">In Blaze Asset Pty Ltd v Target Energy Limited [2009] FCA 698 at [31] --- [33], following consideration of authority, I made the following observations concerning the exercise of the power under s 1322(4): 
 In my view, the exercise of the power under s 1322(4) involves in effect a two stage process. First, the Court needs to determine whether, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the general objects of the CA it is appropriate to make an order extending a relevant period, or abridging a relevant period. Secondly, if those circumstances are made out, then the Court must address the question whether any substantial injustice has been or is likely to be caused to any person by the making of such an order.</sentence>
