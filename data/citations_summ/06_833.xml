<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] QCAT 114">The question which then arises is whether some deduction from the replacement cost is to be allowed for any "betterment" to the plaintiff.

And the quantum of that cost is not diminished by any betterment of the plaintiff's property as a result of the repairs which the plaintiff achieves provide that the plaintiff does not act extravagantly: Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc [2004] FCA 1211 ; (2004) 140 FCR 445 at 542 [485] - [486] per Hely J.

 As Hely J explained in Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc [2004] FCA 1211 ; (2004) 140 FCR 445 at [486] - [487]: 
"486 Subject to questions of extravagance, there is no rule that requires a plaintiff to account for any advantage or betterment which the plaintiff has obtained by repairing an old article with new materials or by acquiring a new article for old in the case of a replacement after total loss, although any savings or profits which the plaintiff makes by use of the new article must be brought to account. Whether damages for notional loss of rent for the period of delay in the completion of the construction of a house should take into account interest that would have been paid on borrowings when the ability to pay off the when the interest on the borrowings has merely been delayed.

 In repairing or replacing a chattel, there are often practical difficulties in obtaining an exact replacement for the chattel which was damaged or destroyed. The question which then arises is whether some deduction from the replacement cost is to be allowed for any "betterment" to the plaintiff. There is no general rule requiring such a deduction to be made: see Consort Express Lines Ltd v J-Mac Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 833 ; (2006) 232 A.L.R. 341 at [14] :
 
"[14] The principle identified by these authorities establishes that a tortfeasor must bear the cost of replacement or repair of the plaintiff's property where that has been damaged or destroyed by the tortfeasor's negligence.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 2014">110 The usual practice of the Court when awarding interest under s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is to adopt the rates of interest applied by the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the Court is sitting. I have previously considered that to be appropriate in a case like the present: Consort Express Lines Pty Ltd v J-Mac Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 833 ; (2006) 232 ALR 341 at 358 [97] . The Supreme Court of New South Wales has a similar power to order interest before judgment under s 100 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). As with s 51A, there is no prescribed rate under s 100 of the Civil Procedure Act . However, Schedule 5 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) prescribe as the rate payable on judgment debts 9% per annum for the period between 1 March 2002 and 31 December 2006 and 10% thereafter. That compares to 10.5% which, since 1997, O 35 r 8 of the Federal Court Rules 2001 (Cth) has prescribed as the equivalent rate on judgment debts in this Court. The practice in the Supreme Court of New South Wales has been to use its prescribed rates as a 'broad standard approach' to the award of prejudgment interest: Kalls Enterprises Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Baloglow (No 3) [2007] NSWCA 298 at [22] per Giles, Ipp and Basten JJA.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] WASCA 276">38 An issue that arises in cost of cure claims is whether, if the costs have not been incurred at the time of trial, it is reasonable to award that measure in the absence of evidence that the plaintiff intends to incur the costs by effecting the cure. Australian courts ordinarily apply the general rule that a court is not concerned with what a successful plaintiff proposes to do with its damages: Bellgrove v Eldridge (620); De Cesare v Deluxe Motors Pty Ltd (1996) 67 SASR 28 , 35; Consort Express Lines Ltd v J-Mac Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 833 ; (2006) 232 ALR 341 [68]. However, it is unnecessary to determine that issue in this case because the uncontradicted evidence of a common director of both respondents was that the damages would be expended on re-creating the drill work.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] NSWSC 1345">30 In another case in the Federal Court, Consort Express Lines Ltd v J- Mac Pty Ltd (2006) FCA 833 where, so far as the judgment of Rares J reveals, there was no issue as to the reasonableness of the sums claimed, His Honour indicated that he regarded reasonableness as a relevant element, in paragraphs 77 and 79 of his judgment :

"77 I am satisfied that the repairs performed to the hydraulics of the vessel's cranes by Perrott Engineering Pty Ltd in November 1999 were necessary and the sum claimed for them is reasonable. .......................................

79 Having reviewed the evidence in the schedule, and the affidavit material relied on by Consort before me, I am satisfied that the costs claimed and the repairs and restoration work performed which are the subject of those claims were reasonable. I find that the repairs and restoration work were at a cost which was reasonably appropriate to bring the vessel into the condition which J-Mac's admittedly negligent reports had described as being 'in good condition for her age'.
