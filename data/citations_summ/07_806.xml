<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1176">
 
 

 
 
 
 Imprisonment 
 
 

 
 
 
 1.8 It is widely accepted that the court should only impose a term of imprisonment in the most serious criminal contempt cases: Keeley v Justice Brooking [1979] HCA 28 ; (1979) 143 CLR 162 at 179; Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238. 
 
 

 
 
 
 1.9 In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Hickey [1999] FCA 259 , Carr J held that imprisonment is a "last resort": see also R v Vasin (1985) 39 SASR 45 ; James (1985) 14 A Crim R 364 ; Skipper (1992) 4 A Crim R 260. 
 
 

 
A Court has considerable flexibility in that it may impose a penalty of fines or imprisonment and then suspend such penalty on conditions or terms: see Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey [2007] FCA 806 ; (2007) 73 IPR 45 at [90] ; Pattison (Trustee), in the matter of Bell (Bankrupt) v Bell [2007] FCA 137 at [49] .

As indicated above (par 1.6), a court has considerable flexibility in that it may impose a penalty of fines or imprisonment and then suspend such penalty on conditions or terms: see also Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey [2007] FCA 806 ; (2007) 73 IPR 45 at [90] ; Pattison at [49].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] WASC 29">78 In Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey t/as DVD Kingdom [2007] FCA 806 [102] the court observed that an order for payment of indemnity costs recognizes both the public interest in ensuring that orders of the Court are complied with and the equity in ensuring, so far as is possible, that an applicant required to take the further step of contempt proceedings should be protected by an appropriate costs order.</sentence>
