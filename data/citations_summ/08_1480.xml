<citphrase id="cp38.19" type=cited from="[1979] FCA 85">trade practices act 1974 (cth), s. 45d (1). the appellant, tillmanns butcheries pty. ltd. ("tillmanns"), was a wholesale and retail butcher carrying on business in canberra and queanbeyan. the first-named respondent, the australasian meat industry employees' union ("the union") was an organization of employees including employees of wholesale and retail butchers and employees in abattoirs. the third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents were the president, secretary and two organizers of the union respectively. in december 1977 two of the respondents entered tillmannss' shop in queanbeyan and asked to see the employees. the request was refused by tillmanns' managing director because it was neither smoko nor lunchtime. the union retaliated by imposing a black ban upon tillmanns' shops. at that time canberra abattoir pty. ltd. ("canberra abattoir"), a company which conducted an abattoir in the australian capital territory, held for tillmanns thirty-two cattle awaiting slaughter and the carcasses of twenty head of cattle and seventeen pigs. as a result of the black ban by the union the live cattle were not slaughtered for some weeks and the carcasses were released to tillmanns only about a week later to avoid deterioration. the appellant instituted an action in the federal court of australia seeking an injunction and damages under ss. 80 and 82 in relation to s. 45d of the trade practices act 1974 ("the act ") alleging that the respondents acted in concert to prevent supplies of meat to tillmanns in breach of s. 45d of the act . the trial judge declined to find that the respondents' conduct had the relevant effect and refused to award damages or to grant an injunction. he stated in his judgment, inter alia, that the plaintiff (appellant) was not entitled to argue that the conduct complained of would be likely to cause substantial loss where the means of proving whether in fact it did cause substantial loss were in its power. the appellant appealed to the full court of the federal court of australia against this judgment claiming that an injunction should have been ordered.  held: per curiam</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp38.20" type=cited from="[1979] FCA 85">the appeal against the first, third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents should be upheld, the cross appeal of those respondents should be dismissed and the appellant should be granted injunctive relief against the above-named respondents because: (1) the appellant was entitled to seek relief on the ground that the relevant conduct of the respondents, if continued, would or would be likely to have the effect of causing substantial loss or damage to the appellant's business.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1074">The section has been recognised as " a qualified and complex deeming provision ": Ackers v Austcorp International Ltd [2009] FCA 432 at [354] per Rares J. It is, however, properly characterised as an interpretation provision and " does not of itself create a cause of action, nor define a norm of conduct ": Ting v Blanche [1993] FCA 524 ; (1993) 118 ALR 543 at 552. Notwithstanding some divergence of views as to the manner of operation of s 51A(2) (see: Readymix Holdings International Pte Ltd v Wieland Process Equipment Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1480 at [91] to [99]), it is considered that s 51A is to be interpreted and applied in the manner explained by Emmett and Allsop JJ in McGrath v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 2 , 165 FCR 230. Emmett J there observed: 
 
 [44] Under s 51A(1) of the Trade Practices Act , a representation is to be taken to be misleading if it is a representation with respect to any future matter and the maker of the representation does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation. Under s 51A(2), the maker of the representation with respect to any future matter is to be deemed not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation unless it adduces evidence to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 407">Section 51A of the Trade Practices Act provides as follows: 
 
 Interpretation 
 (1) For the purposes of this Division, where a corporation makes a representation with respect to any future matter (including the doing of, or the refusing to do, any act) and the corporation does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation, the representation shall be taken to be misleading. 
 
 
 
 
 (2) For the purposes of the application of subsection (1) in relation to a proceeding concerning a representation made by a corporation with respect to any future matter, the corporation shall, unless it adduces evidence to the contrary, be deemed not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation. 
 
 
 
 
 (3) Subsection (1) shall be deemed not to limit by implication the meaning of a reference in this Division to a misleading representation, a representation that is misleading in a material particular or conduct that is misleading or is likely or liable to mislead. 
 

 
Notwithstanding some divergence as to the manner of operation of s 51A(2) (cf. Readymix Holdings International Pte Ltd v Wieland Process Equipment Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1480 at [95] to [99]), it is considered that the provision is to be interpreted and applied in the manner explained by Allsop JJ (Emmett J agreeing) in McGrath v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 2 , 165 FCR 230. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 136">Insofar as the former difficulty is concerned, s 51A of the 1974 Act assumes prominence.
