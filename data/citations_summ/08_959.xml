<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 91">The first respondent also submitted that the omission was only a minor omission and that it was apparent that the intention of the Tribunal was that the decision include the third applicant. Reference was made to authorities to the effect that omissions or typographical errors generally do not amount to jurisdictional error (see SZJRW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 959 , SZMAD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1275 and " CCC" v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 682). Reference was made to the fact that the decision record was a statement of reasons, not the decision itself (see Yusuf ). It was said to be without doubt that the decision made by the Tribunal was that it could not be satisfied that the third applicant met the criteria in s.36(2)(b) of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 447">In relation to ground 4, the reference to the Tribunal using " very old information " which was " produced on 2005 " has not been explained to me. It may refer to the Canadian information which the Tribunal had relied upon when treating some of the documentary material presented by the applicants as unreliable corroborative evidence. The Canadian information had, however, been repeated in an authoritative 2009 report relied on by the Tribunal, and I do not accept that the Tribunal did rely on any " very old information ". Moreover, the choice of the general country information used by the Tribunal was a matter within its jurisdiction, and I cannot see that any jurisdictional error arises from its reliance on such information in the present case (see SZMGS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 168 at [9] , SZJRW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 959 at [47] - [48], and SZDZY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1782 at [23] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 341">It is apparent having regard to the transcript of the Tribunal hearing, that some of the references to Mr Karimov in this summary of the oral evidence at the hearing are typographical errors and should refer to Mr Kurbanov. It is clear from the whole of the Tribunal decision, in particular the findings and reasons part of the decision, that the Tribunal understood that this oral evidence related to the applicant's claimed meeting with Mr Kurbanov (transcript pp.16 --- 19). The applicant did not raise any issue about the incorrect references to Mr Karimov. Having regard to the Tribunal decision as a whole it is not apparent that such typographical errors affected the exercise of power by the Tribunal (cf SZIFI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 63 ; (2007) 238 ALR 611 at [45] per Greenwood J. As in SZJRW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 959 the Tribunal comprehensively examined all the underlying facts going to the applicant's claims (at [68] per Greenwood J and see SZMAD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1275 and " CCC" v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 682). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1188">This is not a case in which it can be said that the Tribunal simply relied on out of date or less current information rather than engaging in an enquiring or analytical approach to the question before it (see SZJRW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 959 at [49] per Greenwood J). The Tribunal comprehensively reviewed all of the evidence before it. It had regard to the applicants' claims about the operation of population and birth control regulations in Fujian as well as the country information in issue. It cannot be said to have failed to take into account a relevant consideration which it was bound to take into account. Insofar as the applicants' argument amounts to an argument that the Tribunal failed to give sufficient weight to the information contained in other documents, such a contention does not establish jurisdictional error. No jurisdictional error is established on this basis. Impact of the social compensation fee
