<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 86">More generally, insofar as Mr Gorczynski sought that this court go behind the judgments of the Local Court by way of revisiting the costs assessments (as he had sought to do in the application for leave to appeal from the costs assessments), in an appropriate case the court has the power to go behind a judgment debt to determine whether there is in truth consideration for a judgment debt on an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice, as well as on the hearing of a creditor's petition. However substantial reasons must be given for questioning whether there is, in truth and reality, a debt due to the creditor (see Olivieri v Stafford ; Goyan v Motyka [2009] FCA 776 ; and Boglari v Coadys (a firm) (2009) 7 ABC(NS) 553; [2009] FCA 1398). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1360">Each proceeding was instituted in the Federal Magistrates Court on 29 April 2008 and transferred to this Court by order made by the Federal Magistrates Court on 9 July 2008. From 29 April 2008 to 13 February 2009, the proceedings have proceeded together and the applicants have been represented by the same solicitors and counsel. On 13 February 2009, the solicitors and counsel previously acting for both applicants announced that they no longer had instructions to act for Mrs Goyan. They were given leave to cease acting for her. Counsel for Mr Goyan then indicated that Mr Goyan was no longer pressing his application and I made an order that it be dismissed. The question of costs was reserved. Mrs Goyan, who was now unrepresented, pursued her application to hearing but was unsuccessful: Goyan v Motyka [2009] FCA 776 (" Goyan v Motyka "). Her application was dismissed on 24 July 2009. </sentence>
