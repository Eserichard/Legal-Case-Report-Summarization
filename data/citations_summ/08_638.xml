<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 42">Fourth, there is some force in the Liquidators' submission that many of the claims made by Altinova against OPSL can sound only in damages and that Altinova seeks to improve its position by agitating the claims as proprietary in nature. Mr Strong therefore submitted that the observations about the grant of leave to pursue proprietary claims made by Finkelstein J in Phisci Pty Ltd v Green Frog Nominees Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 638 at [22] are distinguishable. </sentence>
