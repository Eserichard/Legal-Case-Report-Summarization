<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 558">As the Tribunal has a complete discretion to invoke the provisions of s 424AA , it was not necessary for the Tribunal to comply with section 424AA. Finally, non compliance with the provision (even if embarked upon) would likely not amount to jurisdictional error in any event: see SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 per Tracey and Foster JJ at [103] --- [104], Moore J agreeing at [1]. [15] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 471">There are a large number of authorities to support the above. (See SZMMP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 per Lander J at [63], and also SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 per Cowdroy J, SZMAE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 per Edmonds J, SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1866 per Middleton J, SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 per Gilmour J and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 per Jaggot J, cited in SZMMP at [63] and in SZMCD at [98]. See also SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [99] . ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 46">98 At [63] of his Honour's reasons, his Honour noted that his Honour's decision was consistent with decisions of other judges of this Court in SZLXI [2008] FCA 1270 (Cowdroy J), SZMAE [2008] FCA 1701 (Edmonds J), SZITH 105 ALD 541 , [2008] FCA 1866 (Middleton J), SZLWI [2008] FCA 1330 ; 171 FCR 134 (Gilmour J) and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 (Jagot J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 233">The applicant's contention as to the construction in s 424AA has been considered and rejected by other members of the Court in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 (Cowdroy J), SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 (Edmonds J), SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1866 ; (2008) 105 ALD 541 (Middleton J), SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 (Gilmour J) and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 (Jagot J). Although the reasons in those cases may not be as these reasons, I agree in the results. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 224">Mr Cleary of counsel who appeared for the Minister submitted that the grounds in the amended application did not disclose jurisdictional error. In particular he submitted that a failure to comply with s.424AA of the Act does not constitute jurisdictional error and referred the Court to the Full Court appellate decision of SZLWI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [7] particularly at [19] where his Honour Gilmour J referred to the operation of s.424AA and spoke with approval of the decision of this Court in SZMCD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [8] at [56] and other paragraphs. I was also referred to the decisions of SZLML v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [9] , SZMAE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [10] and SZITH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [11] on that same point. Further, it was submitted that even though there was no obligation, nor can there be, to comply with s.424AA of the Migration Act , the Tribunal did in fact do so as appears from the decision record. </sentence>
