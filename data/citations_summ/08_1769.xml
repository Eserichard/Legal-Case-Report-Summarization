<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 735">In any event, the Commission submits that the question of discretion is not the overriding consideration in the grant of leave to serve outside the jurisdiction. It relies on what was said by Finkelstein J in Brookfield Multiplex Limited v International Litigation Funding Partners PTE Ltd [2008] FCA 1769 at [7] to the effect that, if the conditions provided for in O 8 r 3 are satisfied, it usually follows that leave to serve outside the jurisdiction will be granted. As it was put by Black CJ and Finkelstein J in Humane Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd [2006] FCAFC 116 ; (2006) 154 FCR 425 at [3] , if the required conditions for leave are fulfilled, leave should be given in the absence of some countervailing consideration. Their Honours said at [10] that, provided the jurisdiction of the Court is engaged by an action in respect of subject matter with which the Court can deal, the action is instituted by an applicant who has standing, the action is not oppressive, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process and the Court can assume jurisdiction over the defendant, the Court cannot refuse to adjudicate the dispute. Their Honours continued at [11] to express the opinion that it would be ' curious and anomalous if matters that could not be raised in answer to the appellant's claim by a defendant served within the jurisdiction could nevertheless be taken into account when deciding whether to allow service out of the jurisdiction '. </sentence>
