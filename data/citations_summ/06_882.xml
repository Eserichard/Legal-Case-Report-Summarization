<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] AATA 1055">18. For the review, we have no new medical opinions or reports apart from a supplementary report furnished by Dr Silva on 22 March 2006 at the request of the respondent. We have before us a MRI scan report furnished on 24 July 2006, after the making of the reviewable decision (T172, 530). We also heard oral evidence from Dr Silva. Mr Phillips gave us some definitions of medical terms such as 'ligament', 'sprain' and 'strain' which he obtained from an internet source. Unfortunately, Mr Phillips has not obtained or provided to us any independent medical opinion or legal advice although this course of action was suggested to him by Cowdroy J in Federal Court proceedings he took and which are reported as Phillips v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2006] FCA 882 (7 July 2006).</sentence>
