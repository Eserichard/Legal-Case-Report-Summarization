<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] WAIRComm 668">The point was illustrated in Bank of Queensland Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2008] FCA 324. There Greenwood J at [84] said the relevant parties were entitled to have the Court decide whether a particular agency agreement fell within the scope of the Independent Contractors Act 2006 (Cth) and whether an inconsistency with the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) arose. That is, the scope of the Commonwealth Act needed to be first determined and then a decision made about whether the agency agreement was within that scope. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1435">36 Paragraphs 110 to 116 of the amended defence make allegations as to the effect of particular clauses within an OMB Agreement either alone or, as the case may be, when read with what is described as "the Fit-out Loan" and then plead that the clause or clauses concerned do not constitute a contract for services. In an earlier interlocutory judgment in respect of the then defence, Bank of Queensland Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2008] FCA 324 at [92] to [94] Greenwood J ordered to be struck out particular paragraphs which did no more than set out a contended construction of an OMB Agreement to be struck out. In the subsequent interlocutory appeal, Rossmick No 1 Pty Ltd v Bank of Queensland Ltd [2008] FCAFC 81 at [12] --- [13], the Full Court expressed agreement with the "general thrust" of this approach. </sentence>
