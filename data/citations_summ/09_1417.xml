(1) where any organization or person bound by an order or award has committed a breach or non-observance of a term of the order or award, a penalty may be imposed by the court. . .   "(1a) subject to the next two succeeding sub-sections, where a court finds that two or more breaches by the same organization or person of a term of an order or award have been committed and those breaches appear to that court to have arisen out of a course of conduct by that organization or person, those breaches shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated as constituting a single breach of that term.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1205">His breach could have earned him a dismissal but that penalty was not imposed upon him. It would be wrong not to take those matters into account. In a recent decision, Australian Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union v Rail Corporation of New South Wales (No 2) [2009] FCA 1417 at [13] , Jagot J noted that, although general deterrence will almost always be important, a penalty must be proportionate to the gravity of the particular breach in question. In that case, as in the instant case, the employer's breaches were not deliberate and its actions were motivated by a desire to act fairly towards its employees. 
 The respondent is a substantial company and, as I have said, a subsidiary of an even more substantial one.</sentence>
