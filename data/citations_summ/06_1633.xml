<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] WASC 96">101 As noted, counsel for the plaintiffs relied on observations by Jessup J in Chipper v Octra Nominees Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 1633 for the proposition that the combination of the availability of the equitable remedies of injunction to prevent the breach of a negative stipulation in a contract (not to sell without offering the subject matter to a person who had a contractual right of pre-emption) associated with specific performance, or an order in the nature of specific performance, to compel the delinquent vendor to observe the requirements of the right of first refusal, gave rise to a species of property analogous to an equitable interest which would be accorded priority over a later interest of a purchaser acquiring, with notice, property from the vendor in breach of the requirements of a right of pre-emption. Jessup J, at [84] - [125], relied heavily upon Manchester Ship Canal Co v Manchester Race Course Co and appears to have endorsed submissions to that effect. However, an appeal from that decision succeeded in Octra Nominees Pty Ltd v Chipper [2007] FCAFC 92. The appeal was allowed largely because the Full Court of the Federal Court concluded that the holder of the right of first refusal had lost that right upon declining to purchase the property when given the opportunity to do so by the vendor, after which the vendor sold to a third party on the same terms as had been offered. The Full Court held that subsequent minor variations in the terms of the contract of sale to the third party which made the purchase more attractive to the third party did not give rise to an obligation by the vendor to re-offer the property for sale to the holder of the right of first refusal on the modified terms because, by then, a completed and enforceable agreement to sell to the third party purchaser had been reached, notwithstanding that this was later slightly varied in favour of the purchaser. Accordingly, it was not necessary for the Full Court to examine the effect of the alleged breach of the obligation to give a right of first refusal or the nature of equitable relief which would be accessible had that occurred. Nevertheless, Tamberlin, Gyles and Gilmour JJ observed at [56] that:
 
 Considerable caution needs to be exercised when it is sought to convert an in personam contractual promise into what amounts to a new form of property right enforceable against third parties (cf, in another context, Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22 at [118] - [120].  94 The plaintiffs' claims for relief depend, to a significant extent, upon their contention, already noted, that the right which a member of the partnership of the Atwell Family Agency had at any one time to insist upon strict observance of the pre-emptive rights provisions is a species of property, an equitable interest, not only which endured after an occasion when it had been wrongly disregarded but which takes priority over subsequent proprietary or equitable interests acquired in the partnership and in the partnership property by persons, whom the plaintiffs allege, were wrongly admitted to membership in disregard of the pre-emptive rights provisions. While they acknowledge that the pre-emptive rights provisions in the 1976 agreement are, in substance, negative contractual stipulations ( Tabcorp Holdings Ltd v Bowen Investments Pty Ltd [2009] HCA 8 ; (2009) 253 ALR 1 [12]) which could attract the grant of an injunction if sought in time to prevent their infringement, the plaintiffs contend that they hold more than a mere contractual right and do, in fact, enjoy an equitable proprietary interest capable of specific performance. Counsel for the plaintiffs accepted the established distinction between an option and a right of pre-emption and accepted that the grant of a right of pre-emption conferred on the grantee no right to call for a transfer of the property unless the grantor chose to fulfil the conditions on which the right became exercisable: Pritchard v Briggs [1980] Ch 338 ; [1980] 1 All ER 294 , 418; and Rosebridge Nominees Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] WASCA 107 [26]), but submitted that once the pre-emptive right is triggered by a decision to dispose of the property, the grantee has a proprietary interest capable of enforcement in equity which will rank for priority according to the ordinary rules including that, generally speaking, the interest first in time prevails. In support of the proposition that the negative contractual stipulation, once the right of pre-emption is triggered, is converted to an equitable interest capable of specific performance the plaintiffs rely upon Manchester Ship Canal Co v Manchester Racecourse Co [1901] 2 Ch 37 , 51; Lyle &amp; Scott Ltd v Scott's Trustees [1959] AC 763 ; and Chipper v Octra Nominees Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1633 [84] - [135] (Jessup J). And, for the proposition that the order of priorities of competing equitable interests should usually be determined in accordance with time, they rely upon Heid v Reliance Finance Corp Pty Ltd [1983] HCA 30 ; (1983) 154 CLR 326 ; and Latec Investments Ltd v Hotel Terrigal Pty Ltd (in liq) [1965] HCA 17 ; (1965) 113 CLR 265. </sentence>
