<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1539">40 I will order that leave is granted to appeal against the judgment of Flick J in Tervonen v Finland [2008] FCA 1133. Costs will be reserved. 6 Meanwhile, on 21 December 2007 Mr Tervonen commenced the further proceedings which led to the judgment in respect of which he has sought leave to appeal. On this occasion he filed an application relying on s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) seeking a determination that the extradition request made by Finland on 27 July 2006 was 'invalid'. Those proceedings were dismissed by Flick J on 6 August 2008 ( Tervonen v Finland [2008] FCA 1133). It is against that judgment of Flick J that Mr Tervonen has sought leave to appeal.
