<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 616">The respondents emphasised statements to the effect that the court's power to order that the costs of an interlocutory proceeding be paid forthwith is exercised only in very special circumstances ( Vasyli v AOL International Pty Ltd (unreported, Lehane J, 2 September 1996)). The applicants referred to statements in the authorities to the effect that the power to order that the costs of an interlocutory proceeding be paid forthwith should be used less sparingly than it has in the past: ( Airservices Australia v Jeppesen Sanderson Inc [2006] FCA 906 at [31] per Graham J). 
 

 
 
 23 In addition to the authorities which I have mentioned, I refer to Spotwire Pty Ltd v Visa International Service Association (No 2) [2004] FCA 571 at [103] - [109] per Bennett J; IO Group Inc v Prestige Club Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1147 at [20] - [25] per Flick J; McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 at [13]- [20], [24], [41] per Weinberg J; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 952 at [24] per Gordon J; and Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [35] . 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1360">The Court's power to award costs on an indemnity basis is not in doubt ( Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) s 43 ; Federal Court Rules O 62 r 4). The principles governing the exercise of the power have been discussed in numerous cases and it is sufficient for the purposes of this case to refer to the following: Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd [1988] FCA 202 ; (1988) FCA 202 ; (1988) 81 ALR 397 ; Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 ; Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [32] ). The starting point is that, in the ordinary case, costs are assessed and paid on a party and party basis. There are various categories of cases where a Court will make an order that a party pay costs assessed on another basis, whether it be on a solicitor and client basis or an indemnity basis. The authorities establish that the categories of cases in which such orders may be made are not closed. The respondent did not seek to identify a new category for the purposes of his applications, and the principal categories, in terms of the categories to be considered in this case, are the pursuit of a case where a party, properly advised, should have known the case had no chance of success and the imprudent refusal of a settlement offer by a party. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1064">While the principles articulated in Lenijamar relate to the now defunct O 10 r 7, it is clear that the same principles are applicable in relation to the Court's power under O 35 r 3(1)(a); Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 per Besanko J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 727">In addition to the authorities which I have mentioned, I refer to Spotwire Pty Ltd v Visa International Service Association (No 2) [2004] FCA 571 at [103] - [109] per Bennett J; IO Group Inc v Prestige Club Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1147 at [20] - [25] per Flick J; McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 at [13] - [20], [24], [41] per Weinberg J; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 952 at [24] per Gordon J; and Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [35]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1375">

31 Other cases decided recently in this Court show that these principles are regularly applied: see, e.g., Barrett Property Group Limited v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 (" Barrett ") at [3]-[5] per Gilmour J; Xat Ky v Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd (No 2 ) [2007] FCA 1785 at [12] - [13], [29] per Middleton J; Access for All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] per Collier J; Jainshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 per Besanko J; and Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] - [5] per Finn J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1043"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1010">11 The applicants accept that the decision of Besanko J in Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 means that an order for judgment against the respondent as sought by the applicants would only be made if there has been very substantial default or blatant disregard of prior orders by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 629">The aim is not to punish or deter future litigants but simply to compensate a party fully for costs which normal party-party costs could not be expected to do, where it was unreasonable for that party to be subjected to any expenditure of costs, such as where a hopeless proceeding is brought: Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4]- [5]. Any departure from this general rule requires a special reason: Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] ; Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v Next Publishing Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 971 at [5] . The categories in respect of which departure from the usual rule are contained are not closed: John S Hayes &amp; Associates Pty Limited v [Kimberly-Clark] Australia Pty Limited (1994) 52 FCR [201]; Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [32] . In Colgate-Palmolive, (at p 233) Sheppard J identified various categories which might give rise to an award of indemnity costs. These include: 
&#8226; the making of allegations of fraud knowing them to be false, and the making of irrelevant allegations of fraud;
 
&#8226; evidence of particular misconduct that causes loss of time to the Court and to other parties;
 
&#8226; the commencement or continuation of proceedings for an ulterior motive; 
 
&#8226; wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law; 
 
&#8226; the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions; and 
 
&#8226; an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FamCA 296">The wording of O.10 r.7 of the Federal Court Rules and O.4 r. 1A of the Family Law Rules were very similar. See also Fisher and another v Rural Adjustment &amp; Finance Corporation of Western Australia (1995) 57 FCR 1 and Sheikholeslami v Brungs [2006] FCA 933 . In Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 903 Besanko J said at paragraph 25 that previously the power to make self executing orders was contained in O 10, r 7 of the Federal Court Rules and the power is now contained in O 35A, r 3(1). Order 35A of the Federal Court Rules commenced on 30 August 2004. His Honour then said that in Lenijamar Pty Ltd v AGC (Advances) Ltd (supra) Wilcox and Gummow JJ considered the principles which should govern the discretion to dismiss a proceeding under O 10, r 7 of the Federal Court Rules and that in his opinion their Honours' observations apply equally to the power in O 35A, r 3(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 548">18 This statement has been referred to and adopted in many subsequent cases (see, as examples only, Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 at [48] --- [50], Sheikholeslami v Brungs [2006] FCA 933 at [16] --- [17] and Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [25] ). In my respectful view it is equally apposite in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 1823">3 An award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge except as provided by any other Act: Federal Court of Australia Act s 43(2). The discretion must be exercised judicially. In the normal course, costs are ordered to be paid on a party and party basis: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232; Re Wilcox; Ex parte Ventura Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 152 at 158 per Cooper and Merkel JJ. A costs order is not intended to punish the unsuccessful party but rather to compensate the successful party: Hurst and Devlin v Education Queensland (No 2) [2005] FCA 793 at [5] . This is so even where the ordinary practice is departed from. The aim is not to punish or deter future litigants but simply to compensate a party fully for costs which normal party-party costs could not be expected to do, where it was unreasonable for that party to be subjected to any expenditure of costs, such as where a hopeless proceeding is brought: Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] - [5]. Any departure from this general rule requires a special reason: Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] ; Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v Next Publishing Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 971 at [5] .
