<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 582">Although Mr Ribbands submitted that Mr Snook, in conducting aircraft maintenance, at no time demonstrated a wilful disregard for his obligations or the regulations, the evidence before us and the findings we have made in respect of the audits of the various aircraft upon which Mr Snook conducted maintenance do not support that submission. In fact, there was evidence of Mr Snook deliberately altering dates on worksheets to make it appear that a category of maintenance certified as having been completed was covered by the worksheet entry in question. In any event, even if it could be said that many of the errors Mr Snook made were simply honest mistakes, that does not provide an answer to the fit and proper question. As Perram J said in Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 at [42] : 
 
 It is possible that his honesty could be seen as going to fitness and propriety but it is difficult to understand, without more, how honesty might be an answer to a lack of fitness said to be constituted by incompetence.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 705">In undertaking that task, it is important to appreciate that a notification of the basis of a decision is conceptually distinct from the decision itself: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [30] per Gaudron J; Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 at [31] and Alexander 
 v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority [2010] FCA 189 ; (2010) 265 ALR 424 at [61] . What I need to be satisfied of, if Dr Chandra is to succeed, is that the decision of the Director is infected with error. Dr Chandra cannot succeed simply by establishing that the Director's expression of the basis for his decision is infelicitous: see Tisdall v Webber [2010] FCA 501 at [13] - [14] per Ryan J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 680">This submission is to be rejected for two reasons. First , this is not how s 43(2B) has been repeatedly held to operate. The High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 331-332 [10] per Gleeson CJ, 349 [77] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ established that provisions like s 43(2B) do not require a decision maker to state findings it should have made but only to state the findings it has made; it is concerned, in other words, with the exposure by decision makers of their subjective reasoning processes. This proposition has been repeatedly applied in this Court: Appellant V324 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 259 at [8] per Hill and Allsop JJ, [54]-[55] per Stone J; Repatriation Commission v Cotton [2006] FCA 1523 ; (2006) 93 ALD 118 at 128 [42] per Rares J; Gilkinson v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1441 ; (2008) 104 ALD 406 at 410 [14] per Rares J; Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 253 ALR 263 at 270 [29] per Perram J; Alexander v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority [2010] FCA 189 ; (2010) 265 ALR 424 at 437 [66] per Bromberg J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 189">It is important to appreciate that the reasons for decision of a decision-maker are conceptually distinct from the decision itself: Yusuf at [30] per Gaudron J; Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Limited [2009] FCA 49 ; [2009] 253 ALR 263 at [31] per Perram J. However, reasons for decision may provide the basis for calling into question the correctness of a decision. The failure of reasons to refer to a consideration may reflect the decision-maker's failure to have taken that consideration into account. That conclusion may more readily be drawn in a case where the decision-maker was duty bound to refer to the consideration in its reasons than in a case where the decision maker was not so bound: Kentucky Fried Chicken Pty Ltd v Gantidis [1979] HCA 20 ; (1979) 140 CLR 675 per Stephen J at 682 and 685 (with whom Gibbs, Mason and Aitkin JJ agreed). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1485">There is no reference, in the Full Court's reasons, to either of the High Court's decisions in Yusuf and Palme . Given that it was common ground that, in giving inadequate reasons, the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error of law, I assume that the Court's attention was not drawn to these decisions although I note that, in the primary judge's reasons, His Honour observed, referring to Yusuf , that "it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional": see Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 108 ALD 329 at 345. Whilst it may be accepted that the failure, on the part of a decision maker, to comply with a statutory obligation to provide reasons might constitute an error of law it does not follow that such an error is jurisdictional in nature such as to justify the setting aside of the impugned decision. That position does not change simply because the decision-maker is no longer available to provide further and better reasons. That circumstance does not, in my respectful opinion, render it inevitable that the decision under review should be set aside.  In Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 108 ALD 329 at 337 Perram J, without expressing a concluded view, said that there was "much to be said" for the views of Finkelstein J in Lees . His Honour suggested two additional considerations which supported Finkelstein J's reasons for doubting the correctness of the decision in Dornan . These additional considerations were: 
"First, the reasons which attend an administrative decision are conceptually distinct from that decision and it is the decision, and not the reasons which accompany it, which is the subject of judicial review or, as here, appeal under s 44.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1134">The question whether the Tribunal has complied with s 43(2B) in a particular case is, I think, a question of law: Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 253 ALR 263 at 271-273 [30] - [37] per Perram J. </sentence>

(a) it was open to the Tribunal to impose those conditions; and
 
(b) the Tribunal had not complied with obligations imposed by s 43(2) of the AAT Act to provide reasons which were adequate.

The summary in Ainger v Coffs Harbour City Council [2005] NSWCA 424 at [47] - [49] about the principles informing the requirement to give reasons is also useful. </sentence>
