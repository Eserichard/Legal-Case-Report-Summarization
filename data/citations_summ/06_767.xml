<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] ATMO 45">In the end, it is the similarities of the trade marks and the effects of those on the minds of the purchasers of the goods which I must consider --- the particular differences between the trade marks which have been stressed by the applicant depend on one having the trade marks side by side for a detailed comparison --- that approach is not appropriate for a consideration of deceptive similarity. It is the impression of the trade marks on the minds of the likely market for the goods that I must consider. In Television Food Network, G.P. v Food Channel Network Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 271 ; (2009) 80 IPR 314 Collier J said (at [147]) in relation to the trade marks FOOD NETWORK and FOOD CHANNEL: 
[T]he fact that the word "network" does not sound like "channel", an issue raised by the respondent in written submissions, is in my view irrelevant. As the applicant submits, there are many cases in which relief has been granted in relation to marks which do not sound similar but the allegedly infringing trade mark has been found to be deceptively similar to the claimant's mark (I note, for example, such cases as Re Application by PPI Industries Pty Ltd (1989) 17 IPR 667 (Poly drain and Poly Pipe), Effem Foods Pty Ltd v Wandella Pet Foods Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 767 ; (2006) 69 IPR 243 ("Whackos" and "Dogs go wacko for Schmackos") and Newell v Mattel Inc (2001) 55 IPR 648 (Bar-B-Cute v Barbie) as well as the extensive list of such trade marks and decisions in the Appendix to Shanahan pp 955-982); 
 
[T]he contention of the respondent that trade mark 967804 and the applicant's trade marks are substantially different in appearance, and have no resemblance, is not an answer to a claim of deceptive similarity. That factor is of much greater relevance where the claimant alleges substantial identity between the trade marks under s 44(1). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 58">
 

88 Her Honour went on to make the following findings:
 [147] Further, and addressing specific submissions of [Network], I find that: 
 
 
 &#8226; the fact that the word "network" does not sound like "channel", an issue raised by the respondent in written submissions, is in my view irrelevant. As the applicant submits, there are many cases in which relief has been granted in relation to marks which do not sound similar but the allegedly infringing trade mark has been found to be deceptively similar to the claimant's mark (I note, for example, such cases as Re Application by PPI Industries Pty Ltd (1989) 17 IPR 667 (Poly drain and Poly Pipe), Effem Foods Pty Ltd v Wandella Pet Foods Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 767 ; (2006) 69 IPR 243 ("Whackos" and "Dogs go wacko for Schmackos") and Newell v Mattel Inc (2001) 55 IPR 648 (Bar-B-Cute v Barbie) as well as the extensive list of such trade marks and decisions in the Appendix to Shanahan pp 955-982);
 &#8226; the contention of [Network] that trade mark 967804 and the applicant's trade marks are substantially different in appearance, and have no resemblance, is not an answer to a claim of deceptive similarity. That factor is of much greater relevance where the claimant alleges substantial identity between the trade marks under s 44(1);
 &#8226; I do not accept the submission of [Network] that the words "Food Channel" do not constitute an essential feature of trade mark 967804. In my view, while there are various aspects to the trade mark, those words do constitute an essential feature;
 &#8226; I consider this is also the case in relation to the applicant's trade mark 881667 which features a circle which the words "food" and "network" overlap, with the word "food" above the word "network";
 &#8226; I do not accept the submission of the respondent that, in comparing the marks, it is necessary to have regard to each mark as a whole. The question for the Court is whether the marks are deceptively similar. 
 
 
 
 
 [148] In my view trade mark 967804 is deceptively similar to those of [Television] within the meaning of s 44(1) of the Act. Accordingly I find that the delegate erred in finding that trade mark 967804 was not deceptively similar to [Television's] trade marks. Had I not already found for [Television] in relation to its claims pursuant to s 58 and s 59 I would be prepared to make the orders sought by [Television] in light of my findings in relation to s 44(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] ATMO 36">I also note the comments of Collier J in Television Food Network, G.P. v Food Channel Network Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 271 ; (2009) 80 IPR 314 (at [147]) in relation to the trade marks FOOD NETWORK and FOOD CHANNEL: 
[T]he fact that the word "network" does not sound like "channel", an issue raised by the respondent in written submissions, is in my view irrelevant.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] ATMO 107">In further support, Mr Ziehlke referred to Bennett J's decision in Wellness Pty Ltd v Pro Bio Living Waters Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 438 ; (2004) 61 IPR 242 , where her Honour concluded on the facts before her that use of the composite trade mark PRO-BIO LIVING WATERS for bottled water, (with the elements PRO-BIO and LIVING WATERS rendered in different scripts and font sizes and on different lines), did constitute separate use of the words LIVING WATERS as a trade mark in their own right. Mr Ziehlke also referred to Kolotex Glo Australia Pty Ltd v Sara Lee Personal Products (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 1. Here Wilcox J was considering whether use of the tag line "Sheer Relief for Active Legs" in three places on the Respondent's pantyhose packaging, (twice capitalized as just indicated and the third time entirely rendered in capital letters), constituted use of "Sheer Relief" as a trade mark in its own right. His Honour held it did and thus that the Respondent's use infringed the Applicant's registration for SHEER RELIEF, which covered "Hosiery" in Class 25. Finally, in this context, Mr Ziehlke also referred to Effem Foods Pty Ltd v Wandella Pet Foods Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 767 ; (2006) 69 IPR 243. In this case, somewhat at odds with Mr Zielhke's submissions, Moore J held, inter alia, that GO WACKO as used in the tag line DOGS GO WACKO FOR SCHMACKOS did not amount to use of GO WACKO as a trade mark in its own right, (notwithstanding his finding the offending WHACKOS trade mark of the Respondent deceptively similar to the tag line as a whole). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 271">Further, and addressing specific submissions of the respondent, I find that: the fact that the word "network" does not sound like "channel", an issue raised by the respondent in written submissions, is in my view irrelevant.
