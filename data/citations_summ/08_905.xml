<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] WASC 77">18 In this case, the plaintiffs allege a breach of trust by a company of which one of them is a director. They allege the third and fourth defendants participated in a dishonest and fraudulent design by the trustee. Such an allegation should be clearly pleaded and particularised: Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22 ; (2007) 230 CLR 89 , 162 [70]. It is not sufficient to simply plead serious allegations of that nature as conclusions. The statement of claim must contain the relevant facts to support the conclusions that it alleges arise from those facts: H 1976 Nominees Pty Ltd v Galli [1979] FCA 74 ; (1979) 30 ALR 181 , 186 - 187; Spiteri v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 905 [22] - [24].

Rares J also observed that s 31A is engaged only to determine summarily a claim or defence which has no reasonable prospect of success.
