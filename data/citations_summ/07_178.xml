<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 277">The applicant's challenge was in substance directed to the dismissal of his judicial review application on the grounds of res judicata or estoppel. For the reasons set out most recently in SBFF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 178 at [6] ---[10], this gave rise to a final as opposed to an interlocutory judgment: compare, recently, Applicant S1494/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 286 at [16] , [22] and Brock v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCAFC 165 at [45] - [46] , [53]. It follows that the applicant had an appeal as of right. In this event, I would treat the Notice of Appeal, to which the handwritten word "draft" has later been added, as a Notice of Appeal filed in accordance with O 52 r 15 of the Federal Court Rules . For the reasons stated, I would dismiss the appeal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 183">41 The judges of this Court have differed as to the significance of Re Luck : contrast MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 466 at [7] per Kenny J; SZEEO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 546 at [11] per Tamberlin J; NADZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 975 at [29] - [30] per Graham J; and SBFF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 178 ; (2007) 158 FCR 49 (" SBFF ") at 51 per Mansfield J with S1000 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 285 at [2] per Selway J; SZDEG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 748 at [8] - [9] per Branson J; SYWB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 402 at [30] - [49] per Lander J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 2116">16 Whether the Federal Magistrate was right to conclude that the appellant was prevented from raising these matters pursuant to the doctrine of res judicata may be put to one side: cf Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 242 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10 at [39] and MZWHU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1387 (" MZWHU ") and the authorities cited. On any view, the commencement of this proceeding by the appellant was and remains an abuse of process. The proceeding was doomed to fail. It is the latest in the history of repeated litigation over a period of approximately 
10 years during which the appellant has unsuccessfully sought to establish error in a decision of the delegate made on 9 October 1997. The appellant did not raise any matter which would permit him to reagitate issues already considered and determined against him by the Tribunal, the Federal Magistrates Court and the Federal Court: for example, see SBFF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 178 ; (2007) 158 FCR 49 at [23] ; MZWHU at [30] and [31]; SZFOG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1170 at [22] - [29]; SZATR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 986 at [16] - [18]; SYVB v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCA 1093 at [16] and by the Full Court in Chu Sing Wun v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 314 at 323 (per Carr and Sundberg JJ) and 346-347 (per Kiefel J). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 2115">20 While the appellant asserted that the political climate in Sri Lanka had become more unstable, it is apparent that the current proceeding does not raise any issue that was not addressed in the earlier Federal Court proceedings by Heerey J. Whether the Federal Magistrate was right to conclude that the appellant was prevented from bringing the claim pursuant to the doctrines of res judicata and further or alternatively, issue estoppel may be put to one side: cf Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 242 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10 at [39] and MZWHU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1387 (" MZWHU ") and the authorities cited. On any view, the commencement of this proceeding by the appellant was and remains an abuse of process. The proceeding was doomed to fail. The appellant has not raised any matter which would permit him to reagitate issues already considered and determined against him by the Tribunal, the Federal Magistrates Court and the Federal Court: for example, see SBFF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 178 ; (2007) 158 FCR 49 at [23] ; MZWHU at [30] and [31]; SZFOG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1170 at [22] - [29]; SZATR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 986 at [16]- [18]; SYVB v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCA 1093 at [16] and by the Full Court in Chu Sing Wun v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 314 at 323 (per Carr and Sundberg JJ) and 346-347 (per Kiefel J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 721">There is, however, an oblique suggestion by Mansfield J in SBFF v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 178 at [28] , given in the exercise of the Federal Court's appellate jurisdiction from this Court prior to SZICV , which hints at a constitutional argument allowing the effectiveness of 477 to be challenged.</sentence>
