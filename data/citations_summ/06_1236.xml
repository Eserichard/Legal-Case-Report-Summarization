<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] HCA 31">The reasons of the Full Court 
 
 
 A majority of a Full Court of the Federal Court (Nicholson and Tracey JJ) [103] upheld the decision of the primary judge (Edmonds J) [104] , that the Tribunal was limited in its review powers to the facts and matters upon which the Authority's decision had been based. But the primary judge held [71] that neither MARA, nor the Tribunal on review of a decision of MARA, could set conditions for the lifting of a caution administered to a migration agent, if those conditions could not be imposed as conditions of registration as a migration agent. The primary judge did not accept [70] MARA's argument that the Tribunal's imposition of conditions about the appellant's future work as a migration agent showed either that the Tribunal had concluded that the appellant was not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance, or that the Tribunal had misconstrued the Migration Act provisions about a migration agent being a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance. He considered that a "clear line of authority" obliged attention to the integrity or fitness of the appellant to give immigration assistance as at the date of the Authority's decision [19] . That is, it was the view [86] of the primary judge that conditions would not be set for lifting a caution "which could not be imposed as conditions of an individual's registration as a migration agent". This amounted to a second error of law and to further jurisdictional error [22] . MARA's appeal to the Federal Court was allowed [67] . The primary judge concluded [72] that the conditions imposed by the Tribunal in this case were beyond power. The Tribunal's decision was therefore found to be affected by error of law and jurisdictional error [20] . Because the Tribunal had considered the appellant's conduct during the period between MARA's decision to cancel his registration and the Tribunal conducting its review, the primary judge concluded [69] that it had "asked itself the wrong question; and the Tribunal had regard to matters it was bound not to consider". His Honour held that the question that the Tribunal had to ask itself was whether, on 14 July 2003, the correct or preferable decision was to cancel the appellant's registration; which is to say, whether at that date the appellant was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance [107] . The primary judge expressed [85] the relevant criterion as being whether the conditions set for the lifting of a caution are "conditions which are consistent with the migration agent's registration". The primary judge (Edmonds J) concluded [68] that the question for the Tribunal was whether, at the date of MARA's decision, the appellant was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance. See [2007] FCAFC 59 ; (2007) 158 FCR 525 at 527 [4] citing [2006] FCA 1236 ; (2006) 43 AAR 424 at 430 [8] . If "conditions" were to be imposed, they had to be consistent with continuing registration as an agent [21] . Neither the Authority nor the Tribunal could set conditions which could not be imposed upon an individual's registration as a migration agent [114] . Edmonds J held that this was established by a "clear line of authority" [105] in the Federal Court, commencing with Freeman v Secretary, Department of Social Security [106] . In that Court, a majority (Nicholson and Tracey JJ; Downes J dissenting) affirmed orders made by the primary judge (Edmonds J) [2] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 59">1 The principal issue raised by this appeal is what is the relevant date for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) of the cancellation of a migration agent's licence. One possible date is the date on which the cancellation of the licence took place (so that the evidence which should be taken into account is that which existed at the time of the cancellation or, although the review is subsequent, casts light on the facts at the time of the original decision). Alternatively, the review could be conducted with reference to the date of the Tribunal's decision on review (so that the evidence of events since the cancellation can be taken into account in the review). The primary judge (Edmonds J) held in favour of the former view ( Migration Agents Registration Authority v Shi [2006] FCA 1236 ; (2006) 43 AAR 424). The Tribunal favoured the latter view.</sentence>

 Consideration of the Law and findings of fact 
 
 130. The tribunal should have regard to all relevant evidence to enable the making of findings of fact in relation to the cancellation of Mr Puspawardana's and the secondary family unit members' visas as at the date of the decision, that is 15 July 2005: Freeman v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1988] FCA 294 ; (1988) 19 FCR 342 ; Migration Agents' Registration Authority v Shi [2006] FCA 1236. 131. The tribunal has in the past held that it is entitled to look at activities after the date of visa cancellation and up to the date of the hearing where they can be related back to events prior to that date (see Re Lau and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] AATA 703 ; Re Halim and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] AATA 767 ; Re Griffiths and Migration Agents Registration Authority [2001] AATA 240).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] AATA 927">35. Next, I need to consider the likelihood that the conduct may be repeated. In considering this aspect of the matter it seems to me that I am bound to consider the matter by reference to evidence of the position as at the date of the decision. That seems to me to flow from the nature of the decision under review and the jurisprudence regarding cancellation decisions, most recently considered by Edmonds J in Migration Agents Registration Authority v Shi.
