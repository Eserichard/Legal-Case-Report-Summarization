<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1552">4 The appellant was declared bankrupt on 13 August 2008. He appealed from the decision of that date, and judgment on that appeal is to be delivered at the same time as this appeal. For reasons which appear in that judgment: Rana v Chief of Army [2008] FCA 1554 , that appeal is to be dismissed. However, it is common ground that, notwithstanding his bankruptcy, s 60(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) does not apply as s 60(4) of that Act preserves the appellant's right to maintain the proceeding.
