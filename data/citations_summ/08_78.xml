<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 149">2 The proceedings the subject of this appeal have been on foot for almost three years. Relevant background facts appear in the judgments of Dowsett J ( Welsh [2007] FCA 2064) and Collier J ( Welsh v Digilin Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 78) , and may be summarised as follows:
 
&#8226; The substantive application in these proceedings was filed in 2005, although the claims of the appellant relate to events occurring from the mid 1990s. &#8226; The matter was set down for trial before Dowsett J in April 2006, however the trial dates were vacated after the appellant indicated that he intended to raise new issues in the proceedings. &#8226; The matter was re-listed for trial before the primary judge in October 2006, however the appellant indicated that amendment to the statement of claim would be required. 6 On 18 February 2008 Collier J ordered that leave to appeal be granted from the decision of his Honour ( Welsh [2008] FCA 78).
