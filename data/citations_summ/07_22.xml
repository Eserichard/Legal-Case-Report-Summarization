<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1498">The only basis on which Nufarm therefore puts its application is reduced inconvenience and reduced costs on the basis that, currently, Melbourne lawyers are engaged for all parties. Counsel for Dow Agrosciences referred to Baxendale's Vineyard Pty Ltd v The Geographical Indications Committee [2007] FCA 22 in which he says Mansfield J said that the convenience of the lawyers for the parties is to be regarded as a factor of little weight in the determination. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1925">5 I mention, without pausing to discuss, the other cases to which I was referred: Cycles &amp; Wheelman Pty Ltd v Beltech Corporation Ltd (1988) 80 ALR 279 ; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Pauls Ltd [2002] FCA 71 ; Ogawa v Reynolds [2006] FCA 384 ; (2006) 229 ALR 655 ; Baxendale's Vineyard Pty Ltd v Geographical Indications Committee [2007] FCA 22 ; (2007) 156 FCR 444 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Terania Pty Ltd [2007] ATPR 42-173 ; Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Ltd v Hardel Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 873 ; First National Group of Independent Real Estate Agents Ltd v Elyod Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1260. I have considered each of these cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1074">10 As I have noted, the solicitors for the applicant are in Perth and the solicitors for the respondent in Adelaide. In a slightly different context involving the determination of an appropriate Registry where an appeal should be heard, I made the following comments: 
 
 In my view, generally speaking, little weight should be given to the fact that counsel or the solicitors for a party are in a particular location. Principally, that is because the selection of counsel and solicitors is a matter for the parties. Their choice should not be of significance to the identification of the proper place of a matter. The Court is a national Court with Registries in each State and Territory and can sit anywhere in Australia. However, to an extent, there is a tendency for parties to institute proceedings in a Registry of the Court convenient to counsel or the solicitors for the parties rather than in a Registry which has a real connection with the subject matter of the dispute, or indeed with the parties themselves or the witnesses. I do not think that the Registry where proceedings are instituted should be dictated by that consideration. Further, where that is the case, it may well be appropriate to transfer the proceeding to a proper place, having regard to the considerations discussed in Sentry and other cases: Baxendale's Vineyard Pty Limited v Geographical Indications Committee [2007] FCA 22 ; (2007) 156 FCR 444 at 449. </sentence>
