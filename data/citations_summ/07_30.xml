<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1081">Part 5C.2 of the Corporations Act provides the legislative framework for the responsible entity of a managed investment scheme. But, as we have seen, the Corporations Act cannot be read in isolation. The responsible entity must operate the scheme and perform the functions conferred on it by the Project's Constitution and the Corporations Act : s 601FB. For that reason alone, HML is a proper party. It is, on any view, a person with sufficient connection to the controversy: see Edge; Re Eco Panels Australasia Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 30 ; (2007) 61 ACSR 139 at [12] . It is responsible entity of a managed investment scheme in which the members of the scheme raise serious allegations about what was contained in, and omitted from, the Project's Prospectus. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1451">
 It was submitted that the circumstances of that case were relevantly identical to the case before me although the applicant in NAOB of 2002 made a request for consideration under s.417 of the Migration Act . It has also been brought to my attention that Smith FM has also recently held that this Court does not have jurisdiction in relation to a decision of an officer not to refer a request under s.417 to the Minister due to the operation of sub-s.476(2)(d). In SZLJM v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 1945 , it was submitted that both Smith FM and Raphael FM relied on the reasoning in S1083 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1455 and Raikua &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 30 ; ; [2007] FCA 370 ; (2007) 158 FCR 510. Both the Court in S1083 of 2003 and Raikua considered earlier but similar provisions to the current sub-s.476(2)(d) and in each case it was held that the Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Whilst the Minister notes that the applicant placed importance on the fact that the Minister did not personally consider the exercise of the power which takes the action outside of the exclusion from jurisdiction set out in sub-s.4747(a) but all of the cases above were cases where there was a refusal by a departmental officer to refer a request to the Minister.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 8082">6 The Banks are respondents and potentially liable in their own right. ONGC is not a necessary party to the claim against them. It is not necessary for Clough to join ONGC in order to establish its claims against the Banks : Matheson Engineers Pty Limited v El Raghy [1992] FCA 417 ; (1992) 37 FCR 6 at 9; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Albert [2005] FCA 1311 ; (2005) 223 ALR 467 at [34] . Of course ONGC, whilst not a necessary party, is amenable as a "proper" party to be joined if in the jurisdiction. A "proper", as distinct from a "necessary" party, is a person who has sufficient connexion to the controversy that he or she might be joined, "but whose absence will not affect the constitution of the action": Edge, in the matter of Eco Panels Australasia Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 30 at [12] . As a person who would be a proper party if it were in the jurisdiction, ONGC would be thus amenable to the courts jurisdiction under FCR O 8 r 2, Item 18 (like the former FCR O 8 r 1(g)): Quinlan v Safe International F&ouml;rs&auml;krings AB [2005] FCA 1362 at [24] , applying Costa Vraca Pty Ltd v Bell Regal Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 305.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] VSC 32">25 If not a necessary party, Multinet argues that it is a proper party. It says that it has sufficient connection to the controversy that it might appropriately be joined. Its counsel cited Finkelstein J in Edge, in the Matter of Eco Panels Australasia Pty Ltd (in liq) [11] as authority for the proposition that a "proper party" includes a person who has no direct interest in the controversy between plaintiff and defendant, but who may be adversely affected by the order sought, such as by an injunction or the appointment of a receiver. With respect, the case relied upon by his Honour [12] is not authority for such a broad proposition. In any event, no such relief is sought here. </sentence>
