<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 274">In Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 , Rares J observed that the Court ought to be very cautious to ensure that an injustice is not done to a party by summarily dismissing a proceeding where there may be contested questions of fact to be determined at trial and the resolution of that factual controversy might go one way or the other. Rares J also observed that s 31A is engaged only to determine summarily a claim or defence which has no reasonable prospect of success. That view has been followed in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 416 per Jacobson J [39]; Hicks v Ruddoch (2007) 156 FCR 574 per Tamberlin J [13] and Spiteri v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 905 per Edmond J [10] to [15]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1537">28 When the trial began on Monday, 14 March 2006, junior counsel for Mr Spalla announced an appearance with senior counsel, stating that senior counsel was unwell. I subsequently refused an application for an adjournment. In my judgment of 18 April 2006 (see Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 416 at [11] ) which rejected Mr Spalla's bias application, I said:
 
 "Mr Spalla first raised the issue of my decision to continue with the hearing despite the illness of his senior counsel. As the respondents noted, this was a qualified decision. After a colloquy with the applicant's junior counsel (who has apparently over ten year's experience at the bar) I ruled that the hearing should continue in order that the applicant might present his evidence in chief notwithstanding the absence of senior counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] AATA 523">In Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 416 at [9] the Court cited from the case of Johnson: 
 
 The High Court has stressed that the reasonableness of any complaint of apprehended bias is "to be considered in the context of judicial practice" 
 Thus, events occurring within the ordinary course of litigation will not give rise to an apprehension of bias. Those authorities included Re Seven Network Limited v Another (2004) 182 FLR at 169 Goldberg J, Expectation Pty Ltd v PRD Reality Pty Ltd ( No.2) --- [2006] FCA 392 , Re JRL Ex Parte CJL [1986] HCA 39 ; (1986) 161 CLR 342 , Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2000) CLR 337 , Antoun v The Queen [2006] HCA 2 and Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 416.</sentence>
