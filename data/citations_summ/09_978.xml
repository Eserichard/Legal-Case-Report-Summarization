<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 69">The primary judge identified in Aye v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 978 ; (2009) 111 ALD 546 at [34] , the particulars which were said to support the claim that the determination was void and ought to be quashed which constituted the first two grounds for relief: 
 
 (a) The foreign minister denied the applicant procedural fairness by not inviting comment from her before making the determination. 
 

 
 
 (b) The foreign minister took into account an irrelevant consideration, namely, that the applicant is the daughter of someone subject to sanctions. 
 

 
 
 (c) The foreign minister failed to take into account a relevant consideration, namely, the fact that he did not have anything adverse whatsoever against the applicant herself. 
 

 
 
 (d) The foreign minister asked the wrong question in that he asked whether the applicant was the child of a senior member of the Burmese regime when he should have asked whether the applicant, being a child of a senior member of the Burmese regime, associated herself with her father in support of the regime by any of her actions or in any other way supported the Burmese regime. 
 

 
 
 (e) The foreign minister exercised a discretionary power in accordance with a policy without regard to the merits of the particular case. 
 

 
 
 (f) The foreign minister misinterpreted the words "associate" and "supporter" to mean a child of a senior member of the Burmese regime whereas, contextually, the true meaning of the words is someone retrospectively associated with or supporting whatever activities of the Burmese regime that had brought about the sanctions.
