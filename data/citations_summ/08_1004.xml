(2) the affidavit must show that the debtor has a prima facie case by way of counterclaim, set-off or cross demand which equals or exceeds the cross demand and which case could not have been set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained.  ebert v. union trustee company of australia ltd.

(3) when, as here, the affidavit did not reveal why the alleged counterclaim, set-off or cross demand could not have been set up in the original court proceedings, such affidavit did not comply with the act, with the result that there had been no deemed extension of time to comply with the requirements of the bankruptcy notice.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 45">In Dekkan v Evans (2008) 6 ABC(NS) 334; [2008] FCA 1004 at [52] Jacobson J pointed out that the applicant must satisfy the Court of three inter-related and sometimes overlapping matters: that he or she has a prima facie case, (even if the evidence is not adduced which would be admissible on a final hearing), that he or she has a fair chance of success and that the claim is genuine or bona fide (and see Guss v Johnstone (2000) 74 ALJR 884 ; [2000] HCA 26). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 281">The act of bankruptcy on which the petition is founded is the failure to comply with the bankruptcy notice NN0324/08 served on Mr Dekkan on 17 February 2008. Mr Dekkan applied to the court to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice but on 3 July 2008, I ordered that the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice be dismissed: Dekkan v Evans [2008] FCA 1004. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1985">It is not considered that any state of satisfaction could possibly be reached that Mr Harding has any counter-claim, set-off or cross demand which it is " just " to be resolved before allowing the bankruptcy proceedings to continue: Dekkan v Evans [2008] FCA 1004 at [54] per Jacobson J; Dekkan v Macquarie Leasing Pty Ltd (No 2 ) [2008] FCA 1431 per Buchanan J; Re Cox (1934) 7 ABC 98. The task to be undertaken was formulated in Guss v Johnstone [2000] HCA 26 , 171 ALR 598 by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ as follows: 
 [39] In Vogwell v Vogwell [(1939) 11 ABC 83] , Latham CJ said, in relation to a corresponding provision: 

 
"[T]he authorities show that the matter to which the court looks is this, --- whether it is just that the claim should be determined before the bankruptcy proceedings are allowed to continue; in other words, whether it is a claim which it is proper and reasonable to litigate. "
 
 
 [40] The state of satisfaction referred to in s 40(1)(g), and s 41(7), involves weighing up considerations as to the legal and factual merit of the claim relied upon by the debtor, and the justice of allowing the bankruptcy proceedings to go ahead or requiring them to await the determination of the claim. 

 
It is, with respect, not even possible to be satisfied that Mr Harding has a " shadowy " claim that could be litigated: cf Re Rivett; Ex parte Edward Fay Ltd (1932) 5 ABC 182 at 188. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1371">The evidence is not such as to satisfy the Court that the bankruptcy notice should be set aside on the basis that the applicant has a counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the judgment debt or sum payable under the final order that he could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained within s.40(1)(g) of the Act . There is nothing in the material before the Court to establish that the debtor has a " prima facie case" or " a fair chance of success " (see Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd [1980] FCA 78 ; (1980) 30 ALR 433 at 438 --- 9 per Lockhart J and Re Glew; Glew v Harrowell Of Hunt &amp; Hunt Lawyers (N7350 of 2002) [2003] FCA 373 ; (2003) 198 ALR 331) such that it is just that the claim that the applicant makes in relation to an intention to seek to " reconstitute " an appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal should be determined before the bankruptcy proceedings are allowed to continue. The debtor has not shown the existence of a counter-claim set-off or cross-demand by producing evidence. As Jacobson J pointed out in Dekkan v Evans [2008] FCA 1004 at [54] it is not sufficient that a debtor believes he has a genuine claim. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1452">18 A debtor cannot " satisfy " the Court, for example, by showing no more than the fact that a claim is made and how the claim may be made out: Re Duncan, Ex parte Modlin (1917) 17 SR (NSW) 152 per Street J. It is not sufficient that a debtor believes he has a genuine claim; what is required is that the Court must be satisfied that it is just that the claim should be determined before the bankruptcy proceedings are allowed to continue: Dekkan v Evans [2008] FCA 1004 at [54] per Jacobson J. See also: Dekkan v Macquarie Leasing Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1431 per Buchanan J; Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 139. Mere production of a statement of claim, without more, is not sufficient: Re Cox (1934) 7 ABC 98. Nor is a " shadowy " claim that could not fairly be litigated: Re Rivett; Ex parte Edward Fay Ltd (1932) 5 ABC 182 at 188.</sentence>
