<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 346">In any event the Court proceeded to make what it described as "observations" in respect of two further grounds of appeal vis : (a) that the Tribunal had confused the conditions of 'anxiety disorder not otherwise specified' and 'generalised anxiety disorder' when considering the Statement of Principles to be applied to the applicant's claimed anxiety condition; [7] and (b) that there was little or no evidence to support a finding that the 'generalised anxiety disorder' was war-caused. [8] 
While they were stated to be "observations" by the Court [9] and that findings were unnecessary, the Court proceeded, at least in respect of (b), to set aside and remit that "aspect of the decision" for further hearing. [10]

  ( Repatriation Commission v Brady [5] ) There was no cross appeal lodged against the first Tribunal's determination that the applicant did not suffer PTSD. The Court only noted that finding of the Tribunal in its consideration of the appeal. [6] It is the decision of the Court which is determinative of the future course the Tribunal is to take with respect to a review when the appeal is allowed and remitted for rehearing. A rehearing in the Tribunal is by way of a de novo hearing. In the absence of an order to the contrary from the Court, the Tribunal, when conducting a rehearing, is not restricted to a consideration of only those grounds advanced by a successful appellant in a Federal Court appeal.  In any event the Court proceeded to make what it described as "observations" in respect of two further grounds of appeal vis : (a) that the Tribunal had confused the conditions of 'anxiety disorder not otherwise specified' and 'generalised anxiety disorder' when considering the Statement of Principles to be applied to the applicant's claimed anxiety condition; [7] and (b) that there was little or no evidence to support a finding that the 'generalised anxiety disorder' was war-caused.

  However, in determining to remit the case, the Court did not state that the appeal was allowed and remitted with the hearing to be restricted to which, if either, of the two alcohol related conditions applied, as it is empowered to under s 44(4) and (5) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (the AAT Act). It merely stated that the case was to be reheard.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 658">In case we are wrong in our conclusion that there is appropriate medical evidence before us, in the form of the evidence from Dr Furze, that the clinical onset of PTSD occurred before the onset of alcohol dependence, we now turn to the question of whether we can consider lay evidence in relation to the date of clinical onset. Some authorities suggest that it is necessary for the tribunal to have evidence from a medical practitioner determining, for the purposes of assessing the date of clinical onset of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, that the condition was present at a particular time: see Repatriation Commission v Brady [2007] FCA 1087 at 36 --- 37. In other cases, however, it appears that the Court has considered lay evidence as well as medical evidence. For example, in Lees (supra) a Full Federal Court held that the history of symptoms provided to a psychiatrist was material which the tribunal should have considered as bearing upon the date of clinical onset of the disorder in issue. And in Cornelius (supra) Branson J at [30] pointed out that there was no material before the tribunal which suggested that any medical practitioner had in fact said that a feature or symptom reported by the veteran within the specified time period enabled him or her to say that the veteran had the condition in question. Her Honour nevertheless then proceeded to examine whether there was other relevant material before the tribunal that pointed to the relevant feature or symptom, being material that did so by inference. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] AATA 163">Dr Anderson [18] appears to have agreed with Dr Varghese. Dr Anderson referred in places in his written report and oral evidence rather loosely to both alcohol abuse and dependence. However the diagnostic criteria do not allow for a dual diagnosis. One criterion for a diagnosis of alcohol abuse is that the criteria for alcohol dependence have never been met. [19] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 5">In the present case, Dr Rees has diagnosed PTSD, alcohol dependence and a major depressive disorder and the Tribunal has accepted those diagnoses. Dr Rees also opines that all three conditions have a relationship with the incidents claimed to have occurred on operational service. He attributes PTSD to the incidents raised and that that condition was manifest from the late 1980s. He says the condition had a delayed onset and that is consistent with the pattern of other veterans. He also suggests that alcohol dependence is difficult to estimate in 1973 or indeed 1990 but notes that his alcohol consumption had increased by 1973 and that by that time he would have satisfied the diagnosis of alcohol abuse. He concluded that alcohol dependence resulted subsequently. That is consistent with the decision of Constable v Repatriation Commission [2005] FCA 928 and Repatriation Commission v Brady [2007] FCA 1087. He also suggested a depressive condition is recorded at the earliest in 1980/1981 and that it probably pre-dates alcohol dependence. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1674">43 The clinical onset of such a condition is a diagnostic issue requiring medical opinion: see Cornelius [2002] FCA 750 at [28] ; Lees [2002] FCAFC 398 ; 125 FCR 331 ; Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 ; (2006) 43 AAR 565 at [34] ; Repatriation Commission v Brady [2007] FCA 1087 at [36] . </sentence>
