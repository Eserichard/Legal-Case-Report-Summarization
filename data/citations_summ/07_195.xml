<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] SADC 147">Where the primary and substantial right of action is direct pecuniary loss to property or the estate of the bankrupt, the right to sue passes to the trustee notwithstanding that it may have produced personal inconvenience to the bankrupt. Where the essential cause of action is injury to the personal feelings of the bankrupt, the right to sue remains with the bankrupt: Faulkner v Bluett [1981] FCA 3 ; (1981) 52 FLR 115 at 119. In Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 195 , Greenwood J noted (at 49) that the accepted test, as formulated by Sir Owen Dixon in Cox v Journeaux at 721 was whether any part of the damages arising out of the contravention are to be estimated by immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his mind, body or character and without reference to his rights of property. In Bryant v Commonwealth Bank (1997) 75 FCR 545 , O'Loughlin and Merkel JJ concluded that (at 564):
 ...Mr Bryant's causes of action, as pleaded in his statement of claim, are essentially claims which are referable to his financial and property rights. That is not to deny him his right to allege "personal injury or wrong done to" him or members of his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1093">While TRS cannot proceed on the case as presently pleaded it should be given the opportunity to yet again seek leave to reformulate its statement of claim. This is because s 31A "is not activated by mere deficiencies in the pleadings": Butorac v WIN Corporation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1503 , [19]; see also Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 195 , [59]. If TRS does seek and is granted leave to deliver a further amended statement of claim (a matter which must be of some doubt at this stage of the litigation game), it may be able to show a claim that should be allowed to go to trial. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] APO 13">In Les Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Pty Ltd [2008] APO 11 the delegate noted that a change had been made to section 31A since General Steel (supra) and Stack (supra) which meant that:
 
"the principles set out in General Steel (supra) are not given "canonical force" in summary dismissal proceedings ( Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 425 at 427). Rather, a proceeding may be dismissed where a party has "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding" (see for example Garrett v Macks [2006] FCA 601 , White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 , Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 , Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 , Vans, Inc. v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 , E . &amp; J. Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 136 , and Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227). "
 
 
As noted in the Servier decision, a similar approach is also applied in England and Queensland. It seems clear that Parliament has decided that the approach to summary judgment in all federal courts should be the same, and that the same approach applies to all matters (not just to migration cases). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 476">In determining whether a chose in action is property which remains with the Trustee or a right which does not, it is the character of the cause of action as pleaded or claimed that is important.

Where the essential cause of action is injury to the personal feelings of the bankrupt, the right to sue remains with the bankrupt: Faulkner v Bluett [1981] FCA 3 ; (1981) 52 FLR 115 at 119.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] APO 5">In Les Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Pty Ltd [2008] APO 11 the delegate noted that a change had been made to section 31A which meant that:
 
"the principles set out in General Steel (supra) are not given "canonical force" in summary dismissal proceedings ( Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 425 at 427). Rather, a proceeding may be dismissed where a party has "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding" (see for example Garrett v Macks [2006] FCA 601 , White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 , Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 , Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 , Vans, Inc. v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 , E . &amp; J. Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 136 , and Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227). "
 
 
As noted in the Servier decision, a similar approach is also applied in England and Queensland. It seems clear that Parliament has decided that the approach to summary judgment in all federal courts should be the same, and that the same approach applies to all matters (not just to migration cases). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 959">Insofar as the respondents seek summary dismissal, in White Industries Aust Ltd and Another v Federal Commissioner of Taxation and Another (2007) 160 FCR 298 ; [2007] FCA 511 at [58] --- [59], Lindgren J suggested that a test in terms such as in rule 13.10 was a test of whether the prospect was real and not fanciful or merely arguable (also see Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd (ACN 107 746 798) and Others (2008) 250 ALR 82 ; [2008] FCA 1304 and Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1283 ; (2008) 78 IPR 51). However in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 at [59] , Greenwood J suggested that the court would rarely be satisfied that there was no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a claim, except in the most transparent of cases, on the strength of the conclusion that an applicant's statement of claim was deficient in whole or in part, having regard to the fact that leave to replead might reveal material or facts, within a properly identified legal framework, that on proof, gave rise to a recognised remedy. In Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 Gilmour J at [6] pointed out that in a case where evidence could " give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 936">In Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 195 Greenwood J was satisfied that there was no prospect of the applicant succeeding in the proceedings were they allowed to go to trial in the ordinary way and thus there was a high degree of certainty as to the ultimate outcome. That degree of certainty was informed not just by deficiencies in the pleading but by reason of the weight to be given to factors discussed in the reasons for judgment. His Honour described his conclusions at [64] in the following terms: Perhaps the test in determining a reasonable prospect of successful prosecution of a proceeding is whether there is a demonstrated ' real (as opposed to fanciful) issue of fact to be decided' (Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 , per Rares J [31]---[48]). However, the 'real issue of fact' must be framed within a comprehensible cause of action (in respect of which the applicant has standing) so that findings of fact in favour of the applicant give rise to a recognised remedy. </sentence>

21 In another of those earlier cases, Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 , which again came before Greenwood J, his Honour commented (at [44]):
 Moreover, if the services relied upon by Mr Rogers for the purposes of s 60 of the TPA are financial services as the pleading seems to suggest, s 51AF(1) provides that Part V of the Act within which s 60 falls 'does not apply to the supply, or possible supply, of services that are financial services'. The relevant statutory instrument regulating financial services is the [ASIC Act].  39 In Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 195 , Greenwood J did no more than acknowledge a theoretical possibility, recognised in the authorities to which his Honour referred, of a severable personal injuries claim. As it transpires, Mr Rogers' endeavour to engage that theoretical possibility in practice is, at least as presently revealed, futile, in my opinion. 23 Insofar as those perceived grievances are now presented in a different guise:
 
(a) any cause of action under the ASIC Act that does not fall within s 116(2)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act is vested in Mr Rogers' trustee in bankruptcy; and
 
(b) having regard to Mr Rogers' affidavit of 1 November 2007 and the other evidence upon which he relies, the following further observations made by Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 remain apposite, even though the claim is now formulated by reference to the ASIC Act rather than the Trade Practices Act :
 
 (i) (at [45]) "In truth, Mr Rogers seeks to recover the lost value of the rights and entitlements he says he ought to have enjoyed by reason of the fulfilment of the promises of the relevant respondents in respect of each of the various property transactions pleaded in the statement of claim. Any such claim is vested in the trustee of the estate of Mr Rogers. "; 
 
(ii) (at [55]) "Damages for anxiety or stress may, however, be consequential but severable in the sense of being capable of estimation without regard in the estimation , to the bankrupt's rights of property. The claim by Major Wilson [in Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd [1920] AC 102] considered by Dixon J [in Cox v Journeaux (No. 2); [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 721] was emblematic of a consequential but severable claim which was capable of agitation by the bankrupt. If the damages are capable of estimation in such a way and are capable of being understood as severable from any claim on behalf of the trustee, it seems to me that the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [(1997) 75 FCR 545] applying Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) contemplates that such a claim resides with the bankrupt even though it may be properly described as a consequential claim. " (Emphasis in original; explanatory case references or citations added). 35 The reference to "the principle stated by Dixon J" is a reference to the reasons for judgment of his Honour in Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 721 to which reference is made in the passage which I have quoted above from the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195.  07.12.06 Justice Collier dismissed the balance of proceeding QUD130/2006: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 1708. 15.12.06 Mr Rogers commenced proceeding QUD504/2006 by way of an appeal against Justice Collier's decision in QUD130/2006. 23.02.07 Matter QUD504/2006 dismissed by Justice Greenwood: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195. 14.06.07 Mrs Rogers commenced proceeding QUD173/2007 against the First to Seventh Respondents, seeking virtually the same relief claimed in proceeding QUD525/2005 (which as at the time remained reserved by Spender J) and relief on the same facts, matters and circumstances. 30.08.07 Justice Spender dismissed proceeding QUD525/2005, with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 984">Those principles were summarised by Jacobson J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1416 at [30] in the following terms: &#8226; In assessing whether there are reasonable prospects of success, the Court must be cautious not to do an injustice by summary dismissal. &#8226; There will be reasonable prospects of success if there is evidence which may be reasonably believed so as to enable the party against whom summary judgment is sought to succeed at the final hearing. &#8226; Evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects. &#8226; Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, the discretion under s.31A cannot be enlivened. 
His Honour also noted that it would be wrong to determine an application to dismiss proceedings on a narrow approach to the pleadings where the evidence was incomplete and perhaps ambivalent and which might, at a final hearing, and with amended pleadings, produce a verdict for the applicant. See also Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCAFC 60">161 There is limited authority in Australia on the finality of a summary judgment order: see eg Schiffer v Pattison [2005] FCA 494 ; (2005) 143 FCR 328 at [56] - [64]. In Schiffer , the court attempted to distinguish between summary orders granted in favour of an applicant as opposed to those granted in favour of respondents. Other cases have attempted to address the question by treating the summary judgment order as "effectively final" such that "a prima facie case exists for granting leave to appeal": Duncan v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2007] FCA 507 at [18] quoting Ex parte Bucknell [1936] HCA 67 ; (1936) 56 CLR 221 at 225; see also Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 195 at [32] ; Paramasivan v Flynn [1998] FCA 1711 ; [1998] FCA 1711 ; (1998) 90 FCR 489 at 492-493. Such fine gradations and doctrinal distinctions are unnecessary - either an order finally disposes of the parties' substantive rights, in which case an appeal lies as of right, or it does not, in which case appeal is a matter of discretion rather than right. Moreover, these approaches misconceive the nature of summary judgment, at least to the extent that they rest upon the view "that no final disposition of rights occurs because there has been no adjudication of the controversy of fact nor a dispositive application of the law to the facts as found": Rogers [2007] FCA 195 at [32] . As noted above, the whole point of summary judgment is to dispose of claims on the merits, as a matter of law, precisely because there is no relevant controversy of fact such as to make a full evidentiary proceeding necessary.  161 There is limited authority in Australia on the finality of a summary judgment order: see eg Schiffer v Pattison [2005] FCA 494 ; (2005) 143 FCR 328 at [56] - [64].

Pursuant to this change, the principles set out in General Steel (supra) are not given "canonical force" in summary dismissal proceedings ( Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 425 at 427).

He referred to the judgment of French J in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401. Greenwood J said that the necessary state of satisfaction 'will rarely be achieved (except in the most transparent of cases) on the strength of a conclusion that the applicant's statement of claim is deficient either in whole or in part' because of the facility for leave to replead. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FMCA 2104">This is not a case where deficiencies in pleading are asserted which would raise issues such as was seen in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 and in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1401. The question here, as was discussed by French J in the Fortron case, is whether the party against whom the application is made has any "reasonable prospect" of successfully prosecuting "the proceeding" or the "part of the proceeding" in issue. In White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation at [50] Lindgren J said that s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance not just with form. </sentence>

The applicant has further submitted that the matters are different because they are brought under different statutory schemes and that since QUD525/2005 was commenced "new breaches" had occurred (TS p 20, ll 43-44).</sentence>
