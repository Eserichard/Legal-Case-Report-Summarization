[58] Penalties were increased appreciably, more than five-fold, in 2006, and indicate the Parliament's intention that contraventions of industrial law be treated seriously and that appropriate penalties be imposed. [59] These are matters to be considered in imposing, or deciding whether to impose, a penalty on Buildpower. The totality principle
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 977">The Commissioner submits that the penalty arrived at must reflect the need for specific and general deterrence, as indicated by the general principles stated above. Specific deterrence is directed to ensuring that the contravener is not prepared to embark upon the risk of re-offending. General deterrence is directed to ensuring that the penalty will act as a deterrent to others who might be likely to offend. The penalty should be of a kind that it would be likely to act as a deterrent in preventing similar contraventions by like-minded persons or organisations. If it does not demonstrate an appropriate assessment of the seriousness of the offending, the penalty will not operate to deter others from contravening the relevant provision: see for example, R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 468; ACCC v IPM Operations and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCA 11 at [66] . </sentence>

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 1040">Section 3(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act specifically states that the main object of the Act is "to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building work to ensure that building work is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole". The imposition of penalties for contraventions of provisions such as s 43 is one way in which this is achieved. As already noted, the contraventions under consideration were clear. Bearing these factors in mind, the need for general deterrence is plain enough, with the result that penalties should be imposed at what has been termed a "meaningful level" to serve as a general deterrence to others who may be disposed to engage in the conduct in question: see Stuart-Mahoney 177 IR 61 at 72 [58], citing Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 11 at [66] ; Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia 224 ALR at 479 [41]; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd [2001] FCA 383 ; [2001] ATPR 41-815 at [13] . </sentence>

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Application 
 By application made on 12 September 2007 the Applicant, a workplace inspector appointed pursuant to s.167(2)(a) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth), [1] alleged that the Respondent had contravened various sections of the WR Act , namely ss.337, 341 and 342. The Applicant sought that the Respondent pay a pecuniary penalty under ss.407(1)(b) and 407(2)(g) of the WR Act , and that that penalty be paid to the Commonwealth under s.841 of the WR Act .  Specific deterrence relates to the need to deter a contravener from further contravention of the BCII Act, whilst general deterrence refers to the need to deter others from contravening the BCII Act by showing the seriousness with which the Court considers the contraventions. The penalties must be meaningful and consistent with other considerations to be taken into account in determining an appropriate penalty. [19] In the light of legislative changes in recent years, a "light handed approach" is no longer applicable to the imposition of civil penalties for breaches of industrial law. [20] The penalty imposed in Commonwealth Bank for breach of s.298K of the WR Act was reduced from $600,000 to $300,000 on appeal but a penalty of $150,000 for breach of a certified agreement was not reduced. [21] The reduction in the s.298K penalty was because the penalty was "manifestly excessive" having regard to previous penalties under s.298K of the WR Act.</sentence>

There is a need, as his Honour said, to show "the seriousness with which the Court considers such contraventions". </sentence>

 THE COURT DECLARES AND ORDERS:
 
 DECLARES: 
 
 (1) That each of the Respondents has contravened s.38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 . (2) That the First Respondent has contravened clauses 14 and 27 of the Roche Mining/CFMEU Murray Basin Development Project Construction Sites Agreement for the reasons set out in the Reasons for Judgment herein.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2007] FMCA 1526">Specific deterrence relates to the need to deter a contravener from further contravention of the BCII Act , whilst general deterrence refers to the need to deter others from contravening the BCII Act by showing the seriousness with which the Court considers the contraventions. The penalties must be meaningful and consistent with other considerations to be taken into account in determining an appropriate penalty. [42] In the light of legislative changes in recent years, a "light handed approach" is no longer applicable to the imposition of civil penalties for breaches of industrial law. [43] The penalty imposed in Commonwealth Bank for breach of s.298K of the WR Act was reduced from $600,000 to $300,000 on appeal but a penalty of $150,000 for breach of a certified agreement was not reduced. [44] The reduction in the s.298K penalty was because the penalty was "manifestly excessive" having regard to previous penalties under s.298K of the WR Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2007] FCAFC 132">9 Thus the primary judge found such a contravention occurred in two ways, one of which was claimed on appeal to have been outside the pleadings. In a later judgment he imposed a pecuniary penalty of $125,000 on the CEPU and granted an injunction restraining any future conduct of this kind for three years ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 11 ('penalty judgment')). The CEPU has appealed against his Honour's findings on liability and, if that be unsuccessful, on penalty. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2007] FCA 144">2 The CEPU contested the allegations made against it. The proceeding, in so far as it involved allegations against the CEPU, went to trial before Young J. On 19 December 2006 his Honour made orders declaring that the CEPU had been an accessory to the contraventions, by Edison, of ss 45E(3) and 45EA of the Act. His Honour further ordered that the CEPU be restrained for a period of three years from engaging in any repetition of such conduct directed to Edison: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777. Having heard further submissions relating to the quantum of penalty and costs his Honour, on 16 January 2007, ordered that the CEPU pay a penalty of $125,000 and costs of $200,000: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCA 11. The CEPU has lodged an appeal against his Honour's decision. The appeal grounds challenge his Honour's findings in relation to liability and penalty. 11 Initially, I was concerned that the imposition of a monetary penalty on Edison which was only slightly less than that imposed on the CEPU might not be in accord with the parity principle having regard to the finding of Young J that the CEPU was the instigator of the offending conduct and that the CEPU could not claim the benefit of any discount by reason of any cooperation with the ACCC's investigation or an early willingness to acknowledge liability. However, having heard argument on the point, I was persuaded that the imposition of a penalty of $120,000 on Edison would not contravene the parity principle. I have come to this view having regard to a number of factors. The first is that the CEPU was penalised as an accessory rather than a party principal. Moreover it was penalised in respect of a single course of conduct which extended over two weeks: see [2007] FCA 11 at [40] - [41], [50]. Edison, on the other hand, committed two separate contraventions of the Act, one under s 45E and the other under s 45EA. The contravention of s 45E occurred when Edison, in August 2001, entered into the agreement with the CEPU. The contravention of s 45EA , which occurred when Edison gave effect to the agreement, involved conduct undertaken over a period of more than two years (21 August 2001 until 20 November 2003).</sentence>
