<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 78">The applicant contended that at the hearing she had the right not only to provide oral evidence but also to rebut the points the Tribunal had doubts about, and that the Tribunal had failed to give her this opportunity. As stated by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 228 CLR 152; [2006] HCA 63 , the Tribunal's obligation under s.425(1) of the Act extends to the identification of dispositive or determinative issues arising in relation to the decision under review. However the Tribunal's obligation does not extend to putting its preliminary reasoning to the applicant, in the sense of giving advance notice of proposed adverse findings (see SZIUD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1555 at [15] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 970">In regard to the ground contained in the original application, which seems to me to be the same as ground (2) in the written submission, it is clear that the Tribunal is not required to provide the applicant with a draft of its findings and ask him to comment upon them; SZIUD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1555. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 927">The applicant made a lengthy submission to me at the hearing today. He repeated his claims about illogicality, which I have already dealt with. He asked a number of rhetorical questions which went directly to the evidence and would thus strengthen the view that I have taken that this is merely a strong disagreement with the findings. He claimed that there were no reasons given as to why the Tribunal concluded that he was not a member of the local church in China but that cannot stand a reading of the Tribunal's grounds for decision. He felt that he should have been sent a letter by the Tribunal, telling him why it proposed to find against him. But as Spender J said in SZRUD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1555 at [15] : "Finally, there is no obligation in the Tribunal to give advance notice of its proposed adverse findings. The Tribunal is obliged to hear the applicant and the case he wishes to present. Its obligations to inform the applicant concerning matters are exhaustively set out in s.424A of the Migration Act . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 395">On 5 November 2008 the applicant filed an application in this court. The grounds of the application are fairly lengthy. They commence by a suggestion that the Tribunal did not comply with s.424 of the Migration Act 1959 (the "Act") and breached its obligations under s.424A by not discussing with the applicant independent information or giving him an opportunity to provide an explanation in relation to the findings of the Tribunal. But this is not a ground that can be sustained. In SZIUD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FCA 1555 Spender J said at [15]: Finally, there is no obligation in the Tribunal to give advance notice of its proposed adverse findings. The Tribunal is obliged to hear the applicant and the case he wishes to present. Its obligations to inform the applicant concerning matters are exhaustively set out in s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 317">The final matter contained in the further amended application is that the Tribunal breached s.424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) by failing to disclose to the applicant that it was of the opinion that the deed of agreement was not genuine. As Spender J in SZIUD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1555 at [15] : "Finally, there is no obligation in the Tribunal to give advance notice of its proposed adverse findings. The Tribunal is obliged to hear the applicant and the case he wishes to present. Its obligations to inform the applicant concerning matters are exhaustively set out in s.424A of the Migration Act 1958 . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 891">Before me today the applicant said that he thought that the Tribunal had fallen into jurisdictional error because it had not told him that it proposed to make an unsatisfactory decision and given him some opportunity to make further submissions. It is now well-established that there is no obligation on the Tribunal to give advance notice of its proposed adverse findings: SZIUD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1555 per Spender J at [15]. </sentence>
