Relevant to the exercise of that discretion by the tribunal in the present context is the legislative direction that it must conduct its review in a manner which "is fair, just, economical, informal and quick".

On occasions this Court has made orders that a matter be remitted to the Tribunal in a manner " differently constituted ". Indeed, it has been said that the " usual position [is] that remission to a differently constituted tribunal is the ordinary way to proceed ": Industry Research and Development Board v IMT Ltd [2001] FCA 85 at [40] . See also: Mines v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 1331 at [60] , [2004] FCA 1331 ; 86 ALD 62 at 77; NBMB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 149 at [39] , [2008] FCA 149 ; 100 ALD 118 at 129. Cf. SZJFI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 1860 , 206 FLR 205.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 62">Whilst it was conceded by Mr Ower, Counsel for the applicants, that the decision of Flick J in NBMB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [1] was binding on this Court and was against the applicants' case on this point, he nevertheless sought to put the argument so that the matter might be agitated on any appeal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 61">However as the respondent submitted the Tribunal was within its rights to exercise its discretionary powers under section 363(1)(b) in refusing an adjournment. As Flick J said concerning that power in NBMB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [6] : "The Tribunal unquestionably has a discretionary power to adjourn proceedings; section 427(1)(b) [363(1)(b)] of the Migration Act . Decisions as to whether or not hearings should be adjourned are largely within the discretion of administrative decision makers. Relevant to the exercise of that discretion by the Tribunal in the present context is the legislative direction that it must conduct its review in a manner which "is fair, just, economical, informal and quick". Procedural decisions of Tribunals such as the [Migration Review Tribunal] should not be lightly disturbed. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1436">Consideration of those factors relevant to an informed decision being made to abandon an argument in circumstances more apposite to civil litigation in which litigants are well-represented may assume little (if any) importance in an appeal such as the present. But some significance, it is considered, is nevertheless to be given to even an ill-informed unrepresented litigant apparently abandoning an argument otherwise available to him and thereafter seeking to resurrect on appeal the very same argument. The " interests of justice ", it is to be recalled, encompass the interests of both the unrepresented Appellant and the interests of the Respondents to an appeal. An unconstrained freedom on the part of an unrepresented Appellant to pursue all such arguments as may advance his own interests may well be inconsistent with the interests of a respondent or the more generally expressed public interest in the orderly administration of justice. An absence of prejudice claimed by a respondent may not be a sufficient reason to allow an argument to be raised for the first time on appeal: e.g. NBMB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 149 at [23] to [33] [2008] FCA 149 ; , 100 ALD 118 at 128. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 782">In my view the conduct of the Tribunal in this case is a very long way removed from that in NADH . A reasonable apprehension of bias must be firmly established: NBMB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 149 at [18] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 554">In NBMB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 149 ; (2008) 100 ALD 118 ( NBMB ), delivered on 26 February 2008, Flick J reached a different conclusion. As it happened, his Honour's conclusion was not part of the ultimate reason for deciding the case. In the course of a challenge to a decision of the Tribunal, the applicant sought leave to amend the application to allege that the reconstitution of the Tribunal on the remittal of the review had been improper.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 341">This case differs from cases such as NADH , SZKLK v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1125 and NBMB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 149 which concerned the veracity of the applicant's religious beliefs in circumstances where there had been Tribunal questioning on such matters which has led the Federal Court to express some disquiet (see Wang and Others v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 477 ; (2002) 119 FCR 405 and SBCC ). In this case the Tribunal's credibility appraisal related to whether certain claimed past events had occurred. The applicant had not submitted corroborative material in support of his claims and aspects of his submissions could be seen to be vague and general in certain particulars, albeit consistent with country information. In those circumstances the manner in which the Tribunal sought to test the veracity of the applicant's claims during the hearing by reference to differences between his claims as made at the hearing and his claims made in writing or by raising matters which appeared to the Tribunal to be of questionable plausibility does not demonstrate either actual or apprehended bias from the perspective of the appropriately informed, reasonable observer. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 1719">I note that in NBMB v Minister For Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 149 ; (2008) 100 ALD 118 at [14] Flick J said: "The tribunal unquestionably has a discretionary power to adjourn proceedings: s.427(1)(b) of the Migration Act . Decisions as to whether or not hearings should be adjourned are largely within the discretion of administrative decision-makers. Relevant to the exercise of that discretion by the tribunal in the present context is the legislative direction that it must conduct its review in a manner which "is fair, just, economical, informal and quick". Procedural decisions of tribunals such as the Refugee Review Tribunal should not be lightly disturbed. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 238">48 It is to be remembered that the proceedings before a Tribunal are inquisitorial in nature. There is a distinct difference between judicial officers and Tribunal Members. Judicial officers are required to act both impartially and in a "judicial" manner. A Tribunal Member's role in conducting a review is to "get any information that it considers relevant"; s 424(1) of the Act : NBMB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 149 at [7] . In Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at 435 the court said:
 
 Where, as in the present case, credibility is an issue, the person conducting inquisitorial proceedings will necessarily have to test the evidence presented --- often vigorously. Moreover, the need to ensure that the person who will be affected by the decision is accorded procedural fairness will often require that he or she be plainly confronted with matters which bear adversely on his or her credit or which bring his or her account into question...
 
 Where however, parties are not legally represented in inquisitorial proceedings, care must be taken to ensure that vigorous testing of the evidence and frank exposure of its weaknesses do not result in the person who's evidence is in question being overborne or intimidated. If that should happen, a fair minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person might readily infer that there is no evidence that the witness can give which can change the decision maker's view. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 631">As relevantly observed by Flick J in NBMB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 149 , at [40]: There is no reason to impose any constraint upon the power conferred by s 421(2). The decision of the initial Tribunal having been set aside, the exercise of the power conferred by s 421(2) thereafter arose for consideration. It is a power that can be exercised from time to time: Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), s 33(1). The discretion to be exercised by the Principal Member -- or his delegate -- was a discretion to be exercised in light of all the circumstances, including the order of the Federal Magistrates Court and what is recognised as "justice being seen to be done. " Section 421(2) confers a power of appointment upon the Principal Member -- or his delegate: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 at [40], [2003] HCA 11 ; 215 CLR 518 at 532 per McHugh J. In the present proceedings, that power was exercised by a person with an appropriate delegation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 562">It is clear from the Tribunal reasons for decision that the applicant did at one point request an adjournment. The Tribunal has power under s.427(1)(b) of the Act to adjourn the hearing from time to time. The discretion of the Tribunal under s.427(1)(b) of the Act is confirmed by what was said by Flick J in the recent decision in NBMB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 149 at [14] . However this is a discretionary power. It is relevant to the exercise of that discretion that the Tribunal must conduct its review in a manner which, by virtue of s.420 of the Act, is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. There is no suggestion that the Tribunal failed to consider the application for an adjournment in a manner which negated the applicant's opportunity to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence. </sentence>
