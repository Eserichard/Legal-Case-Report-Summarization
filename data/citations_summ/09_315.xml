<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 1002">The Tribunal gave some consideration to the applicant's claim relating to the forced sterilisation. As Ms Sirtes notes in her helpful written submissions forced sterilisation was a matter which exercised the Federal Court in SZJRU v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 315 ; [2009] 108 ALD 515. But that was a case in which the applicant claimed that if she returned to China she would be forced to undergo sterilisation. Regrettably this applicant has already undergone such an operation and therefore there would be no fear involved. Having considered the Tribunal's decision as a whole I am unable to see any basis upon which it could be claimed that it is the product of a jurisdictional error. The application must therefore be dismissed. I order that the Applicant pay the First Respondent's costs which I assess in the sum of $5,500.00. 
 I certify that the preceding twelve (12) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Raphael FM

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 838">More recently, in the context of consideration of "particular social group", Besanko J in SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [8] stated: "Notwithstanding these principles, it is not necessarily an error for the Tribunal not to begin with (or even to deal with) the question of whether there is a particular social group. The relevant part of the definition of refugee consists of a number of elements and, although they each form part of a compound conception ...failure to comply with one is sufficient to defeat the claim. If the serious harm results from the application of a law of general application and there is no discrimination and therefore no persecution, the claim must fail ... . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 56">Jurisdictional error may lie where the Tribunal "makes a finding and that finding is a critical step in its ultimate conclusion and there is no evidence to support that finding": see SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 at 407 [19] ; see also SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315 ; (2009) 108 ALD 515 at [53] - [54] and cases cited therein; Applicant A227 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 567 at [44] . Another approach to this question is 'jurisdictional fact' analysis: see, e.g., Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21 [39]; VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (' VWBF ') [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at 306 [19] , citing Colonial Bank of Australasia v Willan (1874) LR 5 PC 417 at 442---443 and VXDC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1388 ; (2005) 146 FCR 562 at [13] ; SZAPC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 995 at [47] , [57]. For present purposes, it is unnecessary to determine whether these two approaches co-exist and, if a choice is to be made, to identify the preferred approach. Under either approach, it is necessary to identify with precision the factual finding said to be unsupported by the evidence. Once this is done, it is clear enough that the appellant's no evidence ground fails. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 1165">The applicant relies on SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315 (" SZJRU ") (at [51] to [53] per Besanko J) for the proposition that a finding of fact, for which there is no evidence, may amount to jurisdictional error. Mr Karp submitted that what the Tribunal found at paragraph 41 (see [43] above) was integral to its decision. It was a critical step in the Tribunal's ultimate conclusion. The Tribunal's chain of reasoning was "broken" because there was no evidence to suggest that the law to which it made reference was the "same in substance" as the "new" Regulation No. 54 of 2007. Ground One: The Response
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 891">The applicant contended that the Tribunal's conclusion in this respect either had no basis in the evidence before the Tribunal or revealed that it had failed to have regard to all the evidence before it. It was submitted that to rely on a fact for which there was no evidence constituted jurisdictional error. Reference was made to SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2009] FCA 315 ; (2009) 108 ALD 515 at [51] --- [56] and the authorities cited therein. In the alternative there was said to have been a failure to consider evidence or information essential to the applicant's case, as considered in WAFP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 319 at [16] --- [19], NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [212] --- [213] and [229] and Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v SBAA [2002] FCAFC 195 at [31] and [44]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 399">In SZJRU v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 315 his Honour Besanko J found that the Tribunal erred in proceeding on the basis that forced sterilisation flowed from the enforcement of a law of general application as a penalty as there was no evidence to support the finding [57] . At [64] his Honour said: It seems to me that it would be open to the Tribunal to conclude that the appellant belonged to a particular social group, being those women who became pregnant in contravention of China's family planning laws and who have been required to have that pregnancy terminated. The Tribunal found the appellant had a well-founded fear of serious harm (that is, forced sterilisation) and it seems to me that it would be open to it to conclude that the harm was for reasons of her membership of the social group and not for the reason of the application of a law of general application. In those circumstances, the appeal must be allowed and the matter remitted to the Tribunal.  The applicant contends that the Tribunal fell into error by conflating the concept of a law of general application with a Convention nexus. The Tribunal's decision was based on its consideration of whether the serious harm which the applicant feared, and which the Tribunal found, arose from the enforcement of a law of general application. The applicant concedes that dealing with the issue of persecution before a Convention nexus (here, membership of a particular social group) was not necessarily an error [43] . The applicant concedes that consideration of a law by reference to the question of whether it is a law of general application bears more on the harm feared as a result of breaching the law, in relation to the question of whether persecution is involved, than it does to whether persons who have breached the law constitute a particular social group. The applicant also concedes that if the Tribunal decides that the serious harm likely to result from a law of general application does not involve discrimination, in the sense discussed by McHugh in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration (1997) 190 CLR 225 , the claim must fail in any event without the need to consider a Convention nexus [44] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 543">I accept Ms McWilliam's submission that this case is not out of the ordinary, so that as a general proposition the Tribunal must consider the appellants' case by reference to the particular social group articulated by them (cf Besanko J in SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315).  In response the respondent submitted in summary: The Tribunal did consider the claim of the appellants concerning their membership of a particular social group, namely wealthy middle class businessmen, but it was in the context of the primary submission of the appellants before the Tribunal which was that the male appellant was being persecuted due to his perceived association and support for various Tamil groups. The issue whether a particular social group needs to be considered if there has been no persecution was recently considered by Besanko J in SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315. The Tribunal found, as a finding of fact, a lack of credibility in the appellants' account of events which formed the basis for the claim of a well-founded fear of persecution. In short, the Tribunal did not accept that the appellants left Sri Lanka in the circumstances claimed, nor that they had been targeted by the Sri Lankan security forces, the army, the paramilitary, the Karuna nor anyone else. No jurisdictional error or error in the decision of the Federal Magistrate was apparent in this ground of appeal. Consideration
  Ms Wheatley for the first respondent also directed my attention to recent comments of Besanko J in SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315 at [50] where, after referring to Dranichnikov (2003) 197 ALR 389 , his Honour said: 
 Notwithstanding these principles, it is not necessarily an error for the Tribunal not to begin with (or even to deal with) the question of whether there is a particular social group ... If the serious harm results from the application of a law of general application and there is no discrimination and therefore no persecution, the claim must fail ...
