<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 1674">29. The Tribunal of course accepted as a fabrication the applicant's evidence about what he did in Thailand, Malaysia and Cambodia because it found his evidence to be vague in general, and again that was a finding that was open to the Tribunal. Whilst the Tribunal discussed the question of relocation within in India, at page 87 of the Court book, the Tribunal did not make any relocation finding. It did not need to do so because it was not satisfied that the applicant had a well founded fear of persecution within India. I am referred to the decision of SZCBC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1535 where Dowsett J endorsed the conclusion of the Federal Magistrates Court that the Tribunal was not obliged to consider relocation where it found there was no well founded fear of persecution.
