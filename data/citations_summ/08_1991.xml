<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 38">There is some debate in the authorities concerning the test to be applied when a mandatory injunction is sought at the interlocutory stage. In State of Queensland v Australian Telecommunications Commission [1985] HCA 25 ; (1985) 59 ALR 243 at 245 Gibbs CJ, in refusing to grant a mandatory interlocutory injunction, adopted the observations of Megarry J in Shepherd Homes Ltd v Sandham [1971] Ch 340 at 351 that, in the normal case, the court must "feel a high degree of assurance that at the trial it will appear that the injunction was rightly granted" and that "this is a higher standard than is required for a prohibitory injunction". This approach has been adopted in a number of cases, including in relatively recent times: see, for example, Storm Financial Limited v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1991 at [5] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 269">Mr and Mrs Cassimatis did point to an interlocutory judgement given by Greenwood J in Storm Financial Limited ABN 11 064 804 691 v Commonwealth Bank of Australia ABN 48 123 123 124 [2008] FCA 1991 in which, at a time before the appointment of the administrators, Storm Financial had sought injunctive relief against the bank in respect of alleged misstatements made by the bank concerning Storm Financial's role in the management of client margin loan facilities. His Honour had stated: For present purposes, I am satisfied by the weight of the applicant's material that had the financial adviser assumed a management responsibility for the margin loan transaction in each case and more particularly a "sole" responsibility for the management of the margin loan account through the period, the documents as between the Bank and Storm and in particular the letter of 18 May 2007 would have said so in clear and transparent terms. Secondly, the documents as between the financial adviser and the client would have reflected that position.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 70">The administrators report that the company, prior to its being placed in administration, had instituted proceedings in this Court against the Commonwealth Bank. The nature of those proceedings is described fully in a judgment delivered by Greenwood J, Storm Financial Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1991. An application was made in those proceedings for interlocutory injunctive relief as against the bank. His Honour, for the reasons that he gave on 24 December 2008, refused that application. The substantive proceedings remain on foot. </sentence>
