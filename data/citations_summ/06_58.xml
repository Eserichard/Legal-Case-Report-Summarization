<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1424">25 In support of these submissions, Mr Bryant pointed to observations by Mason J (as he then was) in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985) 162 CLR 24 at 41 to the effect that a court may set aside an administrative decision that has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or has given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance, on the ground that the decision is manifestly unreasonable. It was also noted, by reference to Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift and Ors [1989] FCA 413 ; (1989) 18 ALD 679 and Riddle v Telstra Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 58 ; (2006) 149 FCR 348 , that these principles apply equally to a decision of the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] AATA 793"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] AATA 626">Although s 14(1) of the SRC Act states that Comcare (in this case the MRCC) is liable to pay compensation in accordance with the SRC Act in respect of an injury suffered by an employee if the injury results in death, incapacity for work or impairment, a determination under s 14 in respect of liability does not necessarily involve a determination that the injury has resulted in death, incapacity for work or impairment (see Riddle v Telstra Corporation [2006] FCA 58 ; [2006] 149 FCR 348 at 353).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCAFC 87">55 Telstra concluded its submissions by drawing attention to the decision of this Court in Riddle v Telstra Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 58 , which was handed down (inclusive of corrigendum ) on 10 February 2006, and thus after the decision of the primary judge here the subject of appeal. That case involved three applications which were heard together, and which were summarised by the presiding judge (Edmonds J) as follows:
 
 (i) an applicant's seeking of review of an AAT decision of 6 January 2004, which had affirmed a determination made by Telstra on 28 October 2003 ceasing liability in respect of an aggravation of pre-existing spinal canal 'stenosis at L4/5' on and from 28 October 2003;
 
 (ii) the same applicant's further seeking of review of an AAT decision of 19 August 2004, which had affirmed a determination made by Telstra on 4 August 2004 denying liability in respect of permanent impairment allegedly resulting from that condition;
 
 (iii) the same applicant's further seeking of review of an AAT decision of 26 October 2004 which had affirmed a determination made by Telstra on 6 October 2004 that the applicant had not suffered any injury as a result of the nature and conditions of his employment with Telstra. 

All three decisions had related to claims for compensation submitted by that applicant (Mr Riddle) following the alleged onset of symptoms affecting his lower back and right buttock on 19 February 2003 whilst he was walking from a railway station on his way home from work.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] AATA 223">Nor would it be appropriate for this Tribunal to attempt to disturb those determinations by making inconsistent findings that are not germane to the matters now in issue ( Hannaford v Telstra Corporation Limited [2005] FCA 1298 , Riddle v Telstra Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 58).</sentence>
