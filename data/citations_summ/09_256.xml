<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 419">Section 31A permits the Court to make an order giving judgment for a respondent against an applicant in relation to a proceeding if the Court is satisfied that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding: s 31A(2). In making that assessment, the Court need not be satisfied that the proceeding is hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospects of success: s 31A(3). Parliament intended by enacting s 31A to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment or summary dismissal below the level which had been fixed by authorities such as Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125: Deckers Outdoor Corporation Inc v Farley (No 2) [2009] FCA 256 ; (2008) 176 FCR 33 at 3; Dandaven v Hanbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 at [5] . However, the Court has said that the Court should be slow to dismiss a claim under s 31A in case such an order would create a miscarriage of justice. There is a continuing reluctance to deprive a person of that person's right to seek to have the Court adjudicate on an existing dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1431">In Deckers Outdoor Corporation Inc v Farley &amp; Ors (No 2) [2009] FCA 256 ; (2009) 176 FCR 33 at 36-7 I observed that: 
 
 "11 Section 31A of the Federal Court Act was introduced to extend "the power of the court to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": see Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd (2008) 167 FCR 372 at 406 [124] (per Gordon J) (quoting from the Second Reading Speech of the Minister on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 (Cth)). The section empowers the Court to give summary judgement in favour of an applicant if it is satisfied that the respondent "has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding or [a] part of the proceeding": see s 31A(1)(b). A defence may have no reasonable prospect of success notwithstanding that it is not "hopeless" and not "bound to fail": see s 31A(3). 
 

 
 
 12 Plainly, s 31A was, as Lindgren J held in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [54] , designed "to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment" from the level that had been fixed by the High Court in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-2 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 128-130. Although the standard which must be met by an applicant who seeks summary judgment under the Federal Court Act has been expressed in a variety of different ways, where, as here, an application is made under s 31A, the Court is required to give close attention to the statutory language and to apply that test to the exclusion of all others. As Kenny J said in PZ Cussons (International) Ltd v Rosa Dora Imports Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1642 ; (2007) 74 IPR 372 at [13] :
 'The key is to address the statutory question. That is, under s 31A, in order to grant summary judgment, I must be satisfied that the respondents have no reasonable prospects of success in defending the infringement claim. As s 31A(3) makes clear, this does not mean that I must be satisfied that their defence is hopeless or bound to fail. '"

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1298">The procedural history of the matter prior to 24 March 2009 is essayed in Deckers Outdoor Corporation Inc v Farley (No 2) [2009] FCA 256 ; (2009) 176 FCR 33 at 34-36. In that decision, declaratory and injunctive relief was granted to Deckers under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) for infringement of one of its registered trademarks. Hepbourne was one of the respondents against whom summary judgment was then granted. Deckers' application for summary judgment on claims arising under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) ("the Copyright Act "), the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TP Act"), the Fair Trading Act 1999 (Vic) ("the FT Act") and for passing-off was refused. </sentence>

In its Amended Notice of Motion dated 28 August 2008, Deckers had sought an order that Hepbourne and Vaysman pay it $150,000 pursuant to Terms of Settlement which had been entered into between the parties on 10 June 2005: see [2009] FCA 256 at [5].</sentence>
