<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 942">


 
81 In May 2008 the defendant made an application for leave to extend the time for filing an application for leave to appeal against the decision of Cowdroy J. Rares J ruled that there was no reason to doubt that Cowdroy J was correct in characterising the proceedings as an abuse of court process and made orders restricting any further proceedings in the Federal Court or Federal Magistrates Court relating to the cufflinks dispute ( Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 972). His Honour stated at [6]:
 
 
 "The absurdity of this claim is self-evident from the damages sought, the basis for which Mr Croker never particularised ... The proceedings had, on their face, a demonstration of their vexatiousness and absurdity".  In April 2009 (proceedings number 439/09) Balla DCJ struck out the application on the basis that it was "frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of process". She noted that, properly understood, the defendant was in fact challenging the costs order itself, as distinct from decision of the costs assessor. Having acknowledged that the proceedings were in fact yet another attempt to revisit the plaintiff's grievance against the Commonwealth in respect of a pair of cufflinks in circumstances where the issue has already been finally determined by Rares J in the Federal Court ([2008] FCA 972), her Honour nevertheless made the following comments on the question of costs:
 
 
 "The plaintiff says he should not pay any costs because the defendant is a model litigant and that this is public interest litigation. I do not accept these submissions. The defendant is prima facie entitled to a costs order as it was successful and a model litigant is not required to always bear its own costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 612">Relevant to the exercise of the discretion to grant or refuse an extension of time are such factors as: any explanation for delay in making the application; the prospects of success; and any prejudice or injustice that may be suffered by an applicant. 
This list is by no means exhaustive. See: Garrett v Universal Holidays Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 526. Where no reason has been made out upon which an extension of time ought to be granted and where there are no prospects of success and no injustice, an extension of time has been refused: e.g., Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 972. </sentence>
