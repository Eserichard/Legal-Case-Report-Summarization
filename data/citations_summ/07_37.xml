<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 131">72 The primary judge accepted that the only references in the body of the Bennett specification were to a combination trigger but regarded that as illustrative rather than limiting. His Honour drew attention to the following portion of the Bennett specification ( Aristocrat Technologies [2007] FCA 37 ; (2007) 239 ALR 181 , (2007) 71 IPR 259 at [63] ):
 "It will be appreciated by person skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive. " 
However, prior to that passage, the following appears in the specification: 
 "The arrangement is very flexible in that the value of the bonus prize and the line up required to achieve it can be readily changed. " (Emphasis added. )  76 I should say something about an aspect of that approach to the case. At one point of the first judgment, it was said that both sides agreed that expressing the issue as they had did not do away with the necessity of the Court coming to a final view about the proper construction and meaning of the patent application in suit and the earlier patent said to be anticipation of it ( Aristocrat Technologies [2007] FCA 37 ; (2007) 239 ALR 181 , (2007) 71 IPR 259 at [13] ). However, later in the judgment the primary judge said ( Aristocrat Technologies [2007] FCA 37 ; (2007) 239 ALR 181 , (2007) 71 IPR 259 at [80] ) that senior counsel for IGT: 
 "pressed me with the argument that to the extent that novelty was to be decided by what the Bennett Patent taught the reader, there was room for a difference of opinion. In such a case, the relevant disclosure could not, she submitted, be concluded with the necessary clarity. "  73 The critical reasoning by the primary judge on this point is as follows ( Aristocrat Technologies [2007] FCA 37 ; (2007) 239 ALR 181 , (2007) 71 IPR 259 at [73] ---[75]):
 "The phrase "predetermined objective" would be understood by anyone of ordinary knowledge of the subject to include both a combination trigger and a mystery quantum equalisation trigger. Thus the Bennett Patent can be understood to say that that the programme was arranged so that the programme causes the controller to impose a new game common to all machines and to award a bonus prize to the player of any machine first to achieve a predetermined objective whether by combination trigger or mystery quantum equalisation trigger, the embodiments being by reference to combination triggers. In my view, the terms of the Bennett Patent state the use of a mystery quantum equalisation trigger as the trigger to cause the winning of the bonus prize in the second and separate prize awarding phase. So understood, the patent application was anticipated and was and is not novel. " (Emphasis added. )  67 The primary judge summarised the issue for resolution as follows ( Aristocrat Technologies [2007] FCA 37 ; (2007) 239 ALR 181 , (2007) 71 IPR 259 at [11] ):
 "whether it can be concluded clearly or as a matter of practical certainty that the opposition is well made and that the patent, if granted, would be bad, ... the issue for resolution by the court is not whether the matters grounding the opposition (here want of novelty and obviousness) have been made out in the manner required in revocation proceedings. " (Original emphasis. ) 
The parties had agreed upon the formulation of the issue in those terms. His Honour was satisfied that that reflected the effect of the authorities to which he referred. It is difficult to draw that approach from, or reconcile it with, the provisions of ss 49 , 60 , 158 and 160 of the Patents Act 1990 (the Act) (cf Imperial Chemical Industries Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2004] FCA 1658 ; (2004) 213 ALR 399 per Crennan J at [49]---[53]). However, the correctness of the approach is not in issue in this appeal.  76 I should say something about an aspect of that approach to the case. At one point of the first judgment, it was said that both sides agreed that expressing the issue as they had did not do away with the necessity of the Court coming to a final view about the proper construction and meaning of the patent application in suit and the earlier patent said to be anticipation of it ( Aristocrat Technologies [2007] FCA 37 ; (2007) 239 ALR 181 , (2007) 71 IPR 259 at [13] ). However, later in the judgment the primary judge said ( Aristocrat Technologies [2007] FCA 37 ; (2007) 239 ALR 181 , (2007) 71 IPR 259 at [80] ) that senior counsel for IGT: 
 "pressed me with the argument that to the extent that novelty was to be decided by what the Bennett Patent taught the reader, there was room for a difference of opinion. In such a case, the relevant disclosure could not, she submitted, be concluded with the necessary clarity. "  70 The other basis upon which the foregoing claims, together with claims 3, 4, 11 and 12, were held to be invalid was the conclusion that the Bennett patent disclosed a count trigger in the second or prize awarding phase. The primary judge concentrated upon the following parts of the claims of the Bennett patent (which were consistent with the consistory clause) ( Aristocrat Technologies [2007] FCA 37 ; (2007) 239 ALR 181 , (2007) 71 IPR 259 at [61] ):
 "... the programme being arranged so that on receipt of signals from the machines serving to indicate that a predetermined sum had been accumulated for payment as a bonus prize or a predetermined number of games had been played in the machines the programme causes the controller to provide a visible and/or audible indication to each player and simultaneously acts to suspend any game being played on any of the machines and to impose a new game common to all machines and to award a bonus prize to the player of the any machine first to achieve a predetermined objective, the programme thereafter causing the controller to provide an indication on all machines that the bonus prize had been awarded and causing all machines to revert to independent games. " (Original emphasis. )  6 Before the learned trial judge the respondent relied upon a number of grounds of opposition. Those pressed are summarised in the learned trial judge's principal reasons handed down on 7 February 2007 ( Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v IGT (Australia) Pty Ltd (2007) 71 IPR 259 ; [2007] FCA 37). The learned trial judge found that it was the prior patent specification referred to as the Bennett patent (being Australian Patent No 633469) that deprived certain of the claims of novelty because the Bennett patent disclosed the use of a combination trigger. 66 I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of Heerey and Middleton JJ in draft. Those reasons, read in the light of the principal primary judgments ( Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v IGT (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 37 ; (2007) 239 ALR 181 , (2007) 71 IPR 259 ; and Aristocrat Technologies Australia Ltd v IGT (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1540 , (2007) 74 IPR 117) explain the issues and how they arise. I agree that the appeal ought to be allowed and agree with the orders proposed by Heerey and Middleton JJ. In my opinion, that result follows from the nature of the proceeding in issue.  77 The precise content of the suggested agreement as to construction is not clear. Whatever it was, it could not derogate from the essential issue which had been agreed and stated. That issue is applicable to the ground of lack of novelty just as much as it is to all other relevant grounds of opposition. It is to be noted that the primary judge applied it in dealing with the ground of obviousness ( Aristocrat Technologies [2007] FCA 37 ; (2007) 239 ALR 181 , (2007) 71 IPR 259 at [85] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1529">2 Claims 20 and 21 are omnibus claims and claims 8 and 16 were claims that I dealt with in [93] and [94] of my reasons for judgment dated 7 February 2007 (reported at [2007] FCA 37 ; 71 IPR 259). In dealing with those claims in [94], I am persuaded by the diplomatic submissions of both sides that I expressed a misunderstanding of principle and that the claims are not invalid for the reasons I there expressed. I have been shown some of the submissions that were before me in making my decision in February 2007 and the submissions put by the applicant in relation to claims 8 and 16 are described by the applicant itself as "terse". That is an apt description. I do not say that as a reason why I took the course that I did, but it may or may not have had something to do with it.</sentence>
