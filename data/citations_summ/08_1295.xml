<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 61">1 On 21 August 2008 the primary judge found the appellant, Ascot Four Pty Ltd (Ascot Four), guilty on 11 counts of making a false or misleading representation about the price of goods contrary to s 75AZC(1)(g) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ascot Four Pty Ltd (2008) 250 ALR 467 ; [2008] FCA 1295). Under s 75AZC(1)(g) it is an offence for a corporation, in trade and commerce, in connection with the supply of goods or the promotion of the supply of goods, to make a false or misleading representation about the price of goods. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 28">1 On 21 August 2008 I found the defendant guilty of 11 counts of making a false or misleading representation about the price of goods, contrary to s 75AZC(1)(g) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TP Act): Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ascot Four [2008] FCA 1295. The question of the appropriate penalty to be imposed for those contraventions was then deferred. That matter has now been addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 199">22 It was said to be implicit in that reasoning that the hypothetical consumer would not have been concerned with, or made any assumptions about, the savings to be made by other consumers. Counsel for the ACCC then sought to explain the error attributed to the learned primary Judge by saying that his focus on the individual hypothetical consumer had diverted him from the correct question which was said to have been accurately identified by Mansfield J in these passages from ACCC v Ascot Four Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1295 ;
 '99 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant made a representation about the price of each of the 11 jewellery items by its publication of the Christmas catalogue. The strike through price had a purpose. It was to convey to the consumer or potential consumer some relationship between the sale price and the strike through price.</sentence>
