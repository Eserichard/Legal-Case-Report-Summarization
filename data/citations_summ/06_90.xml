<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 352">29 It may well be the case that a claim under s 588M(2) can properly be determined upon admissions (by the party there called "the director") regarding the several elements referred to in s 588M(1) and imported from s 588G: compare, in relation to the analogous case of s 588FF, Dean-Willcocks (as liquidator of SJP Formwork (NSW) Pty Ltd) v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2004] NSWSC 286 ; (2004) 49 ACSR 325 ; Cooper (as liquidator of Wanted World Wide (Australia) Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1063 ; (2004) 139 FCR 205 ; Hall (as liquidator of Reynolds Vineyards Pty Ltd) [2004] NSWSC 950 ; (2004) 51 ACSR 169 ; Young v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 90 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 654 ; Re Harris Scarfe Ltd; Dwyer v R-Jay Pty Ltd [2007] SASC 115 ; (2007) 97 SASR 377. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] NSWSC 1113">3 As between the liquidators and the Commissioner, the controversy is narrow. The Commissioner concedes all matters of fact and law necessary to ground a conclusion that each of the payment transactions in question constituted an "unfair preference" within s 588FA and was, accordingly, an "insolvent transaction" within s 588FC. The Commissioner's concessions or admissions are, of themselves, sufficient to cause the court to be "satisfied" in the manner described in s 588FF: Dean-Willcocks (as liquidator of SJP Formwork (NSW) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2004] NSWSC 286 ; (2004) 49 ACSR 325 ; Cooper (as liquidator of Wanted World Wide (Australia) Pty Ltd) v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1063 ; (2004) 210 ALR 635 ; Hall (as liquidator of Reynolds Vineyards Pty Ltd) v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] NSWSC 950 ; (2004) 51 ACSR 169 ; Young (as liquidator of TransAustralian Pty Ltd) v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 90 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 654 ; Harris (as liquidator of Denlizco Trading Pty Ltd) v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] QSC 108 ; 57 ACSR 706 ; Noxequin Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] NSWSC 87. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] VSC 626">9 Mr Crutchfield then sought orders against the Commissioner including declarations that implicitly find that the company was insolvent at the time of the payments. That raised the issue of whether the Court could or should make a declaration of insolvency without any final determination on the evidence as to the correctness of that determination, where it has not otherwise made any findings on the issue. [1] Mr Crutchfield relied on Young v Commissioner of Taxation, [2] where Tamberlin J stated, after examining the authorities on the issue: 
 
 I consider that on a purposive approach having regard to the practical considerations as to expense, time and the importance of considered admissions in the absence of any real contest are powerful considerations sufficient to demonstrate that Crosbie [3] was clearly wrong, with the consequence that I am not obliged to follow the reasoning of that case. [4] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] NSWSC 998">117 There has been a debate in the authorities about the operation of ss 588FF and 588FGA(1) and (2) in the context of an admission by the Commissioner as to a company's insolvency but denial (or non-admission) of insolvency in the same proceedings by a director sued for indemnity, see for example: Crosbie v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 922 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 1659 ; Harris v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] QSC 108 ; [2006] 2 Qd R 445 ; Young v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 90 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 654 ; Dean-Willcocks v Commissioner of Taxation (No.2) [2004] NSWSC 286 ; (2004) 49 ACSR 325. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] SASC 115">Later decisions have criticised that conclusion: see, for example, Dean-Willcocks Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2004] NSWSC 286 ; (2004) 49 ACSR 325 ; Cooper v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1063 ; (2004) 139 FCR 205 ; Hall v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] NSWSC 950 ; (2004) 51 ACSR 169 ; Young v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 90 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 654 ; and Duncan v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 885 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 555.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] NSWSC 87">Such a concession or admission constitutes a sufficient basis for the court to be "satisfied" as mentioned in s.588FF(1) , as between the liquidator and the Commissioner: Dean-Willcocks (as liquidator of SJP Formwork (NSW) Pty Ltd) v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2004] NSWSC 286 ; (2004) 49 ACSR 325 ; Cooper (as liquidator of Wanted World Wide (Australia) Pty Ltd) v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1063 ; (2004) 210 ALR 635 ; Hall (as liquidator of Reynolds Vineyards Pty Ltd ) v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] NSWSC 950 ; (2004) 51 ACSR 169 ; Young (as liquidator of TransAustralian Pty Ltd) v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 90 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 654 ; Harris (as liquidator of Denlizco Trading Pty Ltd) v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] QSC 108 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 706.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] FCA 885">25 In Crosbie , Finkelstein J also expressed the view, which was not necessary to his decision, that the Court should not act on the parties' admissions as to insolvency without satisfying itself on the evidence as to the correctness of that admission. In his Honour's view, this conclusion followed from the fact that the Court can only make an order under s 588FF if it is satisfied that a transaction of a company is voidable under s 588FE. Subsequent cases have rejected this view, and held that the Court can reach the requisite satisfaction on the basis of the parties' agreement: see Wanted World Wide (Australia) Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1063 ; [2004] FCA 1063 ; (2004) 139 FCR 205 (' Wanted World Wide ') and Young v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 90 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 654 (' Young' ). As I see it, no practical significance attaches to the issue in this case, notwithstanding the settlement reached between the plaintiff and the Commissioner, because the claims made by the plaintiff as to solvency and other matters were contested by Scott and Fairbank. However, if and to the extent that the issue has any significance for this case, I prefer, and would apply, the views expressed in Wanted World Wide and Young .
