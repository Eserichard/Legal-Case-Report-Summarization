<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 520">The plaintiffs in this proceeding have attempted to wind up an unregistered managed investment scheme ( the Scheme ) operating in contravention of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ( CA ). The reasons for that course were outlined in my previous judgment in Lake Coogee Estate Management Pty Ltd ACN 115 352 504 v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2009] FCA 471 (Lake Coogee No 1 ) (and see also the earlier decisions of Nicholson J ( Lake Coogee Estate Management Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2006] FCA 1809 ; (2006) 60 ACSR 281 and Lake Coogee Estate Management Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 692).  The original orders granting that permission were made by Nicholson J in Lake Coogee [2006] FCA 1809 ; (2006) 60 ACSR 281 and in supplementary reasons in Lake Coogee [2007] FCA 692. In orders which I made in Lake Coogee No 1, the supplementary orders in Lake Coogee [2007] FCA 692 were amended to extend the period during which the Scheme was required to be completed but at the same time to improve the reporting of progress in the attempts to complete the Scheme to the investors in it.
