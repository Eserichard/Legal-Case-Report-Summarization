<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 123">NOPL contends that it has suffered loss and damage for the purposes of s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act") by reason of Tarong's contended contraventions of s 52 of that Act. NOPL pleads a number of representations as to future matters and relies upon s 51A of the Act. Section 51A(2) casts an evidential onus upon Tarong to adduce evidence that it had reasonable grounds for making the contended representations as to future matters in the absence of which evidence the deeming effect arises. Once the evidential onus is discharged, a dispositive onus (s 51A(1)) falls upon the applicant to demonstrate that Tarong did not have reasonable grounds for making the representations: North East Equity Pty Ltd v Proud Nominees Pty Ltd [2010] FCAFC 60 ; (2010) 269 ALR 262 at [33] and [36]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Sports Challenge [2002] FCA 1276 ; Fubilian Catering Services Ltd v Compass Group (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1205. </sentence>

 What is said in Universal Sports and Fubilian about the evidential burden as opposed to onus of proof is important in the present case. If s 51A(1) stood alone, an applicant would have to establish the absence of reasonable grounds for making the representation. Without that, the cause of action under s 52 would be incomplete. The deeming effect of subs (2) arises only when the representor fails to adduce evidence to the contrary; that is to say, some evidence that it had reasonable grounds for making the representation.

29 Section 51A(2) imposes an evidential burden on a respondent. It does not impose on a respondent the legal or persuasive burden of proving that reasonable grounds existed for making the representation alleged: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Sports Challenge [2002] FCA 1276 ( Universal Sports ) at [46]. In Fubilian Catering Services Ltd v Compass Group (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1205 ( Fubilian ), French J said at [545]:
 Section 51A '... does not of itself create a cause of action, nor define a norm of conduct' ... It does not create a cause of action independent of that created by s 52 when read with s 82 ... It certainly casts the 'evidential burden' on the respondent in the sense of an obligation to adduce evidence on the issue of whether there were reasonable grounds for making the representation. It does not impose on the representor the legal or persuasive burden to prove that it had reasonable grounds for making the representations alleged ... [T]he section does not refer to the onus of proof when it applies. It merely requires the alleged representor to 'adduce evidence to the contrary'. There may be a question whether the representor can discharge the evidential burden by pointing to evidence which forms part of the applicant's case. In my opinion a respondent may rely upon evidence called by an applicant which answers the description 'evidence to the contrary'.  33 What is said in Universal Sports [2002] FCA 1276 and Fubilian [2007] FCA 1205 about the evidential burden as opposed to onus of proof is important in the present case. If s 51A(1) stood alone, an applicant would have to establish the absence of reasonable grounds for making the representation. Without that, the cause of action under s 52 would be incomplete. The deeming effect of subs (2) arises only when the representor fails to adduce evidence to the contrary; that is to say, some evidence that it had reasonable grounds for making the representation. Once the representor discharges that evidential burden, the matter is thereafter dealt with under subs (1), the obligation being on the applicant to establish that the representor did not have reasonable grounds for making the representation. 32 An appeal to the Full Court in Fubilian [2007] FCA 1205 was dismissed: Fubilian Catering Services Ltd v Compass Group (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 53 , but there was no discussion of the matters canvassed at [29]-[30].</sentence>

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 1288">In Fubilan Catering Services Ltd v Compass Group (Aust) Pty Ltd [30] the Federal Court said that a misleading and deceptive conduct plea which relies upon s.51A of the TP Act should make it clear that it involves the allegation that the representor did not have reasonable grounds, and that if want of reasonable grounds was not expressly pleaded it should be taken as implied, and if it was not able to be implied then the pleading should be regarded as deficient. [31] In Fubilan Catering the Federal Court went on to say: The preceding analysis has consequences for dealing with the way in which the cause of action for misleading or deceptive conduct based upon statements of future fact is set up. The causal connection between the respondent's conduct in such a case and the loss or damage claimed is not the breaking of the promise or the failure of the prediction.

 "It is important however to bear steadily in mind that s 51A does not introduce a rule of law that a promise which is not performed or a prediction which is not fulfilled is thereby misleading or deceptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] QSC 258">No evidence has been adduced, therefore the representation is taken to be misleading within the meaning of s 51A(1). [105] I am satisfied that the plea has been properly raised. As French J (as he then was) stated in Fubilan Catering Services Pty Ltd v Compass Group Aust Pty Ltd: [34] 
 
"541 The cause of action for misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of s52 of the TPA is created by s 82 which provides (1) subject to subsection (1AAA) a person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of a provision of Part IV , Part IVA , Part IVB or V and section 51AC may recover the amount of loss or damage by action against that other person or against any person involved in the contravention. ......So where misleading or deceptive conduct is alleged it must be shown that the applicant suffered loss or damage as a result of that conduct. ...

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] QSC 58">[190] In Fubilan Catering Services Pty Ltd v Compass Group (Australia) Pty Ltd, French J said: [107] 
"[Section 51A] does not reverse the onus of proof when it applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 498">I considered the operation of s 51A of the TPA in Fubilan Catering Services Ltd v Compass Group (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1205 and repeat here the substance of the analysis set out there. It is well established that the making of a promise which is not performed or a prediction which is not fulfilled is not of itself misleading or deceptive: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88; Boll Acceptance Corporation Ltd v GWA Ltd [1983] FCA 269 ; (1983) 50 ALR 242. A promise or prediction may contain an implied representation of present fact such as the promisor's intention or capacity to perform the promise. If such implied representations are false then the promise may be misleading or deceptive within the meaning of s 52 of the TPA. A prediction or promise apparently based on the expertise or experience of the representor may carry with it an implied representation as to the existence of that necessary expertise or experience and an implied representation that relevant inquiries have been undertaken to support the opinion being offered. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCAFC 2">In Fubilan Catering Services Limited v Compass Group (Australia) Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1205 , French J approved of the views of Emmett J in Universal Sports Challenge [2002] FCA 1276 (though not referring to Stone J in Lewarne [2007] FCA 1136) when he said the following at [545]: 

 The way in which the section was pleaded was close to unintelligible. Paragraph 68 seemed to suggest that it was invoked as an element of the prohibition imposed by s 52. But s 51A "... does not of itself create a cause of action, nor ... define a norm of conduct": Ting v Blanche [1993] FCA 524 ; (1993) 118 ALR 543 at 552 (Hill J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCA 1587">19 In Fubilan [2007] FCA 1205 at [543] French J continued that that did not mean the contravention of s 52 needed to be established as the only cause, merely that the misleading or deceptive conduct could set in train a chain of events where an applicant is led into error on the basis of the conduct, either directly or through the inducement of another person who relied on the conduct, which then caused the applicant to suffer the loss or damage. His Honour observed that the way in which s 51A had been pleaded was close to unintelligible. He said that s 51A does not create a cause of action independent of that created by s 52 as read with s 82. 36 When I gave directions on 10 July 2007 and again on 9 August 2007 requiring the formulation of a clear statement of issues, I had emphasised that the Court has for some years insisted that the parties put their cases fairly and squarely on the table, so that each understands what is in issue. As I have identified above, there are substantive overlaps of the factual matters relied upon in different parts of the pleadings. It cannot be said that the plea under s 51A of the Act raised an entirely discrete, stand-alone aspect of the case that can be seen to be divorced from other material facts or evidentiary matters. Nonetheless, the respondents did not articulate clearly their reliance upon matters as going to the identification of reasonable grounds for the evidentiary purposes of s 51A(2), in the sense described in Fubilan [2007] FCA 1205 by French J, with whose reasons on this matter I agree. 21 French J also held that the analysis (which I have been describing) had consequences for dealing with the way in which a cause of action for misleading or deceptive conduct based upon statements of future fact is set up. The causal connection between a respondent's conduct in such a case and the loss or damage claimed is not the breaking of the promise or the failure of the prediction. The causal connection which must be shown to exist is a causal connection between the loss or damage claimed and the making of the promise or prediction without reasonable grounds ( Fubilan [2007] FCA 1205 at [548] ). 17 More recently in Fubilan Catering Services Limited v Compass Group (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1205 , French J considered the operation and pleading of s 51A. He pointed out that the pleading there asserted that in making representations the respondents engaged in conduct that was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, contrary to s 52 of the Act, '... including without limitation, by operation of s 51A ...': Fubilan [2007] FCA 1205 at [535] . French J said that the pleading appeared to misconceive the operation of s 51A. He observed that there was no plea that the respondents did not have reasonable grounds for making the various statements of a promissory or predictive character attributed to them. He then said, as is the case here, that there was a plea that in reliance upon the relevant representations the applicants there entered into an agreement which they would not have done if the representations had not been made. His Honour emphasised that the cause of action was founded on a contravention of s 52 of the Act which led to a situation where loss or damage was caused to the applicant for the purposes of s 82(1) of the Act. 20 French J said that s 51A required that a statement about a future matter made without reasonable grounds would be treated as if it were misleading or deceptive and thus the section could be said to involve a limited extension of the scope of s 52. He emphasised that a pleading of misleading or deceptive conduct which relied upon s 51A should make clear that it involved the allegation for the representor to not have had reasonable grounds for making the statement alleged. In addition, French J noted that a pleading of misleading or deceptive conduct based upon a statement about future facts may not expressly plead want of reasonable grounds, yet invoke s 51A, in which case it could be taken to plead for want of reasonable grounds or, if that implication were not open, it should be regarded as deficient ( Fubilan [2007] FCA 1205 at [547] ). 17 More recently in Fubilan Catering Services Limited v Compass Group (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1205 , French J considered the operation and pleading of s 51A. He pointed out that the pleading there asserted that in making representations the respondents engaged in conduct that was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, contrary to s 52 of the Act, '... including without limitation, by operation of s 51A ...': Fubilan [2007] FCA 1205 at [535] . French J said that the pleading appeared to misconceive the operation of s 51A. He observed that there was no plea that the respondents did not have reasonable grounds for making the various statements of a promissory or predictive character attributed to them.

His Honour emphasised that the cause of action was founded on a contravention of s 52 of the Act which led to a situation where loss or damage was caused to the applicant for the purposes of s 82(1) of the Act. In my opinion a respondent may rely upon evidence called by an applicant which answers the description "evidence to the contrary". To make a promise which is not performed or a prediction which is not fulfilled is not of itself misleading or deceptive. ' ( Fubilan [2007] FCA 1205 [545]-[546]) </sentence>
