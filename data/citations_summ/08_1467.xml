<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 291">Instead, one asks whether the alleged infringer has used the sign so as to indicate that the origin of the services was in itself: see Coca Cola at [20] and [28] and Global Brand at [47];
 
(c) The latter question is the question that has to be determined at this threshold stage: see Coca Cola at [30]. The determination of this threshold question only involves an examination of the impugned mark, not the registered trade mark: Global Brand at [49];
 
(d) In assessing whether the alleged use is use as a trade mark, the Court is required to examine the purpose and nature of the use in its context. This includes factors such as the positioning of the sign, the type of font used, the size of the words or letters, and the colours which are used, as well as how the sign is applied to the advertising material in question: see The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd [1963] HCA 66 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407 (" The Shell Company ") at 422 per Kitto J; Johnson &amp; Johnson at 347 per Gummow J; Sportsbreak Travel Pty Ltd v P &amp; O Holidays Ltd (2000) 50 IPR 51 (" Sportsbreak ") at [14] per Burchett J; Christodoulou v Disney Enterprises Inc [2005] FCA 1401 ; (2005) 156 FCR 344 at [35] per Crennan J; and Anakin Pty Ltd v Chatswood BBQ King Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1467 ; (2008) 250 ALR 620 at [60] to [61] per Branson J;
 
(e) This assessment of the purpose and nature of the use of the sign is objective, ie by reference to what a member of the public could be expected to understand by its use: see The Shell Company at 425 per Kitto J; Sportsbreak at [14] per Burchett J and Aldi Stores Ltd Partnership v Frito-Lay Trading Company GmbH [2001] FCA 1874 ; (2001) 190 ALR 185 (" Aldi ") at [76] per Lindgren J;
 
(f) The words (of a mark) may be used to describe the goods or services concerned, but still serve as a badge of trade origin: see Johnson &amp; Johnson at 343 and 347 and Coca Cola at [26]. The question is whether consumers are being invited to purchase the services on the basis that they are to be distinguished from that of other providers of those services partly because they are described by the words used: see Johnson &amp; Johnson at 347 to 348 per Gummow J, Coca Cola at [26]; and cf Aldi at [23] per Hill J and [60] per Lindgren J;
 
(g) It has been doubted whether the mere registration of a domain name containing the words of a trade mark constitutes the use of those words as a trade mark for the purposes of s 120 of the Trade Marks Act : see CSR Ltd v Resource Capital Australia Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 279 ; (2003) 128 FCR 408 (" CSR Ltd ") at [42] per Hill J and the cases referred to. However, if the registered domain name is linked to a website that contains advertising material that promotes goods or services in relation to which the trade mark is registered, this combination of use could constitute use as a trade mark under s 120 of the Trade Marks Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] ATMO 18">In Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 100 the decision turned on the trade mark owner's own evidence, which was used to highlight confusion about which of two corporate entities was to use the trade mark. In the present matter, in contrast, there is no scope for such debate or for any consequent misapprehension. Again, in Anakin Pty Ltd v Chatswood BBQ King Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1467 , rectification of the register was ordered because, ultimately, the person identified on the register was not the true owner of the trade mark. This had arisen in conjunction with irregularities in terms of the payment of stamp duty and with regard to duties under the Corporations Act . Branson J declined to exercise her discretion and thereby allow the challenged registration to stand.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWSC 1378">44 Reference was made to Anakin Pty Ltd v Chatswood BBQ King Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1467 ; (2008) 250 ALR 620 at 645 [109] where Branson J inferred that the custom of a new restaurant named Chatswood BBQ King included the custom of persons who knew of the BBQ King restaurant and, being under a misapprehension that the Chatswood restaurant was associated with the BBQ King restaurant, ate at the Chatswood restaurant rather than travelling to the city to eat at the BBQ King restaurant. </sentence>
