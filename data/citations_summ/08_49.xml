<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 256">The operation of s 77 was considered by Rares J in The Polo/Lauren Company LP v Ziliani Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 49 ; (2008) 75 IPR 143. His Honour explained (at 162-163) the purpose served by ss 74 and 77 (2) by reference to a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission and to an Explanatory Memorandum presented to Parliament: 
 "The amendments came about following concerns raised in the Australian Law Reform Commission's Report No 74, Designs: see the revised explanatory memorandum accompanying the Designs (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 circulated by the authority of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources in the Senate. The revised explanatory memorandum said: 

 
 The broad policy is that artistic works commercially exploited as three-dimensional designs should generally be denied copyright protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 195">1 The first respondent, Ziliani Holdings Pty Limited, imported into Australia from the United States of America, for the purpose of sale, genuine Polo Ralph Lauren garments. Most, but not all, bore the well-known polo player logo which is a representation of a polo player swinging a mallet whilst astride a cantering polo pony ("the Logo"). Mr Ziliani, who is the principal behind Ziliani Holdings Pty Limited, acquired the garments at various trade fairs in the United States of America where, apparently, last season's fashions may be purchased at a substantial discount: The Polo/Lauren Co LP v Ziliani Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 49 ; (2008) 75 IPR 143 at 146 [18] . It is convenient to refer to Mr Ziliani and his company together as "Ziliani". 13 Polo/Lauren pointed to a passage in the primary judge's reasons in the following terms ( Polo/Lauren [2008] FCA 49 ; 75 IPR 143 at 156-157 [48] ):
 Mr Ziliani said that in his experience in the clothing trade, clothing marketed under a particular name or trade mark, such as GUCCI, CALVIN KLEIN, VERSACE, POLO, PETER MORRISSEY and the like, was generally referred to as being clothing sold under or from a particular "label". Mr Ziliani said that by referring to "well-known clothing labels" he meant the brand of a particular line of clothes. Of course, he appreciated that an item of clothing also could have a physical label which contained a brand name of the maker.  27 We do not accept that the Logo is purely decorative. It also has a function. The primary judge found ( Polo/Lauren [2008] FCA 49 ; 75 IPR 143 at 154 [39] ) that "the [Logo] has considerable significance in identifying clothing as emanating from the Ralph Lauren group". Subject to the trade mark issue, which we will consider below, it is clear that the Logo, which also may be accepted as decorative, at least served the function of identifying those clothes with Polo/Lauren. 30 Polo/Lauren submitted that his Honour had effectively interpreted the expression label to mean trade mark. This submission is correct. His Honour said ( Polo/Lauren [2008] FCA 49 ; 75 IPR 143 at 157 [51] ):
 I am satisfied that a natural and ordinary English meaning of the word "label" includes a brand name, trade mark and the name by which a design or fashion house, and its product, such as "Polo" and "Ralph Lauren" and "Polo Ralph Lauren", is generally known.  47 The learned primary judge concluded ( Polo/Lauren [2008] FCA 49 ; 75 IPR 143 at 165 [84] ) that the 784 stitches making up the Logo were sufficiently three dimensional to amount to visual features of shape or configuration and that, in consequence, the defence under s 77 could be made out.
  26 Polo/Lauren argued that these definitions required that a label had to have a function that usually, but not invariably, was one of identification. Polo/Lauren submitted that "[a]s a matter of language the label will have the characteristic of conveying instructions or details concerning the ownership, use or nature of the item. " The Logo could not, so it was submitted, have that characteristic since it was primarily decorative. Further, Polo/Lauren submitted that the learned primary judge ( Polo/Lauren [2008] FCA 49 ; 75 IPR 143 at 159 [60] ) erred when focusing on the "practical effect" of the Logo. It was submitted that the Logo could only have the practical effect of identifying the garments as being associated with Polo/Lauren if a consumer knew that the Logo connoted a connection with Polo/Lauren. Without such knowledge, the Logo was merely a rider on a horse with a stick, symbolising nothing. Polo/Lauren posited that whether something was a label or not could not depend on the states of mind of consumers. Such a focus, it was said, was more apposite to the tort of passing off and proceedings under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). 23 The learned primary judge considered a number of dictionary definitions in the following terms ( Polo/Lauren [2008] FCA 49 ; 75 IPR 143 at 157 [49] ): 
 Likewise, the Collin's English Dictionary 3rd Aust ed, Harper Collins, 1991gives the following definitions of the noun "label": 
 
 
 1. a piece of paper, card or other material attached to an object to identify it or give instructions or details concerning its ownership , use, nature, destination, etc.
 ...
 4. a trademark or company or brand name on certain goods ... [Emphasis added] 
 
 
The Macquarie Dictionary (online edition) defines "label" as including: 
 
 
 1. a slip of paper or other material for affixing to something to indicate its nature, ownership, destination, etc.
 ...
 5. a trade name, especially of a recording company in the music industry. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 447">7 Before moving to the substantive issues, however, I note that the fact that both the Design Drawings were exploited industrially by application to a T-shirt and swing tag, respectively, will not deprive them of copyright protection (indeed, no suggestion to the contrary was raised by the parties), provided that they are original artistic works; The Polo/Lauren Company LP v Zilani Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 49 at [73] notes that "artistic works exploited in two dimensions as visual features of pattern or ornamentation will ... retain copyright protection" (quoting the Revised Explanatory Memorandum to the Designs (Consequential Amendments ) Bill 2003 (Cth)). </sentence>
