<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1303">I note submissions made in relation to the concerns expressed by Flick J in SZLHM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 754. As I said during the course of the hearing today, I want to respectfully add my voice to the concerns enunciated by his Honour in that case. I particularly add that it is a sorry state of affairs, where applicants who already have so many disadvantages, such as the applicant before the Court today, disadvantages of language, culture and lack of understanding of how the relevant system operates in Australia, put their reliance in "friends" for assistance who clearly lack capacity and knowledge to properly assist in the conduct and prosecution of their matter before the Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1097">This of course is a well established proposition and has been re-stated in various appeals from this Court such as SZHCJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs, [9] SZLHA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [10] and SZLHM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [11] , where Flick J referred specifically to a decision of the High Court in Attorney General New South Wales v Quin [12] , particularly the decision of Brennan J at [35] and [36]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 991">The Tribunal made findings of fact which were open to it on the evidence. The task of making findings of fact, including findings as to credibility, is for the Tribunal alone ( SZLHA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [22] , at [5], citing Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [23] . The Court cannot conduct a merits review of the Tribunal's decision ( Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [24] ; SZHCJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [25] at [3]; SZLHM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [26] at [8] --- [9]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 935">It is for the Tribunal to assess the merits of the evidence. It is no part of the role of a court conducting judicial review to trespass into the realm of reviewing the merits of an administrative decision the subject of the review ( SZLHM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [42] , citing Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [43] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 933">It is for the Tribunal to assess the merits of the evidence. It is no part of the role of a court conducting judicial review to trespass into the realm of reviewing the merits of an administrative decision the subject of the review ( SZLHM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [53] , citing Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [54] ). It was for the Tribunal to decide what weight it should give to various matters ( Abebe v Commonwealth [55] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 1139">However, the Court does not have the power to undertake merits review of the Tribunal decision. This situation was addressed recently on appeal from this Court by Flick J in SZLHM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2008) FCA 754 where his Honour said at paras. 8 and 9: Left to one side is an apparent misapprehension on the part of the appellant as to the role of the Federal Magistrates Court. It simply was no part of the function of that Court to assess the merits of the claims being advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 886">It is no part of the function of this Court to assess the merits of the claims for refugee status being advanced by the applicant; that is the task of the Tribunal, not the Court. As Flick J stated in SZLHM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [10] : It is important for those who apply to the Federal Magistrates Court seeking review of decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal, and who subsequently seek to appeal to this Court, to understand that it is the Tribunal that resolves questions of fact. It is no part of the role of a court conducting judicial review to trespass into the realm of reviewing the merits of an administrative decision the subject of review: Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1. </sentence>
