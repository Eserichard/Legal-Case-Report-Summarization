<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 198">The first respondent submits that nothing in SZEWL gives rise to the proposition that third party documents/statements are not information given by a review applicant in circumstances where they themselves provide them to the Tribunal. Moreover in the extract of judgment set out in paragraph [4] above, Rares J uses the expression "given orally by a witness", his Honour is clearly recognising that distinction which is reinforced in paragraph [45] of judgment where his Honour emphasised that " a witness is not information ". It is the same distinction alluded to by Branson J in SZECG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2006] FCA 733 (cited in SZEWL with approval) at [23] where her Honour speculated that specific information given to a Tribunal orally by a witness at the request of an applicant would be information given by the applicant for the purpose of the application if the information were limited to a particular topic and the nature of the evidence was generally known to the applicant. The distinguishing feature for the purposes of section 359A(3)(b) appears to be the question of certainty. Ordinarily, oral evidence that a witness will give is not finite or absolute at the time an applicant asks a Tribunal to take that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 209">Branson J doubted that it could be said that the appellant "gave" the information implicit in his father's evidence. She said that the hearing before the tribunal was not an inter parties judicial hearing but formed part of an administrative enquiry. Her Honour observed that the appellant there did not call his father to give evidence but rather advised the tribunal that he wanted it to take evidence from his father". Branson J did not reach a concluded view on the question although she doubted that s 424A(3)(b) disclosed an intention that every piece of information that the tribunal gleaned from the evidence of the witness called at the request of an applicant for review was to be treated as evidence given to the tribunal by that applicant for the purpose of the application: SZECG [2006] FCA 733 at [22] - [23].  In SZECG [2006] FCA 733 at [21] Branson J followed the obiter reasons of Lee and Tamberlin JJ in Applicant M164/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 16 at [96] - [99] per Lee J, with whose reasons Tamberlin J agreed at [108]. They held that s 424A was engaged where the tribunal relied on alleged inconsistencies between evidence of the applicant's husband and that of the applicant.  In VBAM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCA 504 at [44] Gray J said: 
 "The evidence of the three witnesses was information that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application. " 

 
His Honour did not refer to the terms of s 426 when arriving at that conclusion. That decision was followed by Gordon J in SZIAT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 766 at [39] . She also referred to Bennett J's decision in SZAQI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1653 at [23] - [24]. There, Bennett J again referred to the concept of an applicant calling a witness to give oral evidence on his or her behalf as being within the scope of s 424A(3)(b). Bennett J distinguished the contrary construction by Branson J in SZECG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 733 at [17] - [22]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 452">In SZILK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 1318 his Honour Smith FM found: 39. The information relating to the statutory declaration which was identified by the Tribunal was that it "does not state that the applicant was a practitioner of Tien Tao in China". I consider that this information was sourced in the statutory declaration, and that it was used adversely as part of the Tribunal's reasoning. However, in my opinion the whole of that statutory declaration, including the limits of its contents, was information which the applicant "gave for the purpose of the application" within the exclusion of s.424A(3)(b). 40. This is because it was, as I have described above, presented by the applicant's agent to the Tribunal in support of her application for review. I do not consider that Federal Court authorities, which are somewhat discordant, in relation to the application of s.424A(3)(b) to evidence orally given by an applicant's witness appearing at a Tribunal hearing have relevance in the present situation (compare Young J's discussion in Applicant M47/2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 176 with Branson J's discussion in SZECG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 733). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 392">He held that their evidence was information that the applicant gave for the purposes of the application. That decision is inconsistent with the remarks of Lee J (agreed to by Tamberlin J; Dowsett J dissenting) in the later decision of the Full Court in Applicant M164/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 16. Branson J followed that later decision in SZECG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 733. In that case, Branson J held that the appellant had not given information to the Tribunal by advising the Tribunal that he wanted the Tribunal to take evidence from his father.
