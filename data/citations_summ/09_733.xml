<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 140">1 On 9 July 2009 a judge of the Court dismissed an application by the present appellant (Mr Lafu) for an order setting aside a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT) affirming a decision of a delegate (Delegate) of the first respondent (Minister) cancelling Mr Lafu's Class TY Subclass 444 Special Category visa: Lafu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 733. The AAT's reasons for decision can be found at: Lafu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] AATA 218 ; (2009) 107 ALD 678. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1057">A Tribunal's compliance with all aspects of s 43(2B) --- be it the requirement to set forth its " reasons ", the requirement to include " findings on material questions of fact " or the requirement that there be " a reference to the evidence or other material " --- is a matter of substance and not form: Dodds v Comcare Australia (1993) 31 ALD 690 at 691 per Burchett J; Comcare v Davies , supra , at [33]. The statutory requirement, it is to be recalled, has as a principal objective the exposure of the reasoning process of the Tribunal to judicial scrutiny. There must be sufficient compliance with each aspect of s 43 such that judicial scrutiny is not frustrated. But the manner in which the Tribunal discharges its responsibility to comply with s 43(2B) must inevitably depend upon --- among other things --- the nature of the cases coming before the Tribunal, the nature of the evidence and legal complexity of each case, and the particular style in which Tribunal members choose to express themselves. The less important a particular matter may be to the conclusion reached by the Tribunal, the less the need for the Tribunal to " refer to " or deal in any depth with the evidence relevant to that matter: e.g. Lafu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 733 at [28] to [30] per Jagot J. A failure to refer to evidence of little ultimate significance to the conclusion reached may not permit an inference that such evidence has not been considered. </sentence>
