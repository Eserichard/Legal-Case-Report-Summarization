<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 203">One of the factors considered by Austin J in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission [2000] NSWSC 316 ; (2000) 174 ALR 688 was the utility of a reinstatement order. As noted by Austin J, the Court is entitled to have regard to public interest. In that case, the public interest was in ensuring the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), as it then was, were enforced. There are similar cases concerning claims for compensation where the ability to pursue such claims was taken into account in the exercise of discretion. The public interest in the Commissioner pursuing a claim for outstanding income tax, in my view, falls within a similar category ( Re James Hardie Australia Finance Pty Ltd (Deregistered) [2008] FCA 1181 ; (2008) 170 FCR 545 (at [16])). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1411">In Re James Hardie Australia Finance Pty Ltd (Deregistered) (2008) 170 FCR 545 ; [2008] FCA 1181 Lindgren J considered an application for reinstatement with a view to making amended assessments. At [13]-[16] Lindgren J said: 
 
 [13] An application under s 601AH for reinstatement of the registration of a company may be made by "a person aggrieved by the deregistration". According to s 601AH(2)(b) , it is a condition of the enlivening of the Court's power to order reinstatement that the Court be "satisfied that it is just that the company's registration be reinstated".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 10">3 In an associated proceeding NSD 910 of 2008 brought by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner) as plaintiff, I delivered two judgments: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation; in the matter of James Hardie Australia Finance Pty Ltd (Deregistered) [2008] FCA 1181 and Deputy Commissioner of Taxation; in the matter of James Hardie Australia Finance Pty Ltd (Deregistered) (No 2) [2008] FCA 1928. I will call them respectively the "Reinstatement Judgment" and the "Directions Judgment".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1928">1 On 8 August 2008, on the application of the plaintiff, the Commissioner (I use the term "Commissioner" to refer generically to the Commissioner of Taxation and the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation), I made an under s 601AH(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Act) that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission reinstate the registration of James Hardie Australia Finance Pty Ltd (JHAF), and that Max Christopher Donnelly of Ferrier Hodgson, the present applicant, be liquidator of JHAF: see Deputy Commissioner of Taxation; re James Hardie Australia Finance Pty Ltd (Deregistered) (2008) 67 ACSR 497 ; 248 ALR 557 ; [2008] FCA 1181. I will take the earlier reasons as read.</sentence>
