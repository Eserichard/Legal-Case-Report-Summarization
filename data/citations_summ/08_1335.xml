<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 691"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 252">On 20 August 2008 Mr Zentai had been committed to prison to await surrender pursuant to s 19(9) of the Act. On the same day, he was released on various conditions, including bail, pursuant to orders I made in Zentai v Republic of Hungary [2008] FCA 1335. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1597">In previous bail applications brought by Mr Zentai (such as Zentai v Republic of Hungary [2008] FCA 1335) it has been accepted that the risk of flight is extremely low. His age, medical condition previously described in earlier applications, long association as an Australian citizen, strong family connections with the Australian community, lack of financial resources (as a pensioner) are circumstances which, of themselves, make any risk of his absconding most unlikely. Added to those circumstances (and accepting that flight risk must be considered independently of any bail conditions), the conditions imposed on the orders directing his release including the impounding of his passport and the requirement that he regularly report to authorities and his movements be restricted realistically mean that there is no risk of Mr Zentai absconding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 511">The general background to Mr Zentai's case is set out at some length by McKerracher J in Zentai v Republic of Hungary [2008] FCA 1335 and for ease this morning, I would adopt that in these reasons.</sentence>
