<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 498">In King v Northern Territory [2007] FCA 944 ; [2007] FCA 944 ; (2007) 162 FCR 89 , Moore J considered the extent to which the claimed native title rights were extinguished by the construction of improvements in exercise of the rights granted by non-exclusive pastoral leases. The parties in that case agreed that his Honour was bound to give effect to the reasoning of the Full Court in De Rose that when certain improvements were lawfully made on leasehold land, native title rights were extinguished on the land on which each improvement was made. The applicants in that case accepted that native title rights were so extinguished by the construction of some forms of improvements, such as homesteads, sheds and buildings, but disputed that they were so extinguished by the construction of other types of improvements such as stockyards and traps yards. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 26">74 A similar set of circumstances can be found in the case of King v Northern Territory of Australia (2007) 162 FCR 89 ; [2007] FCA 944 in which Moore J made a determination in favour of a claimant group which comprised peoples from nine different estate groups and six neighbouring estate groups. All 15 of these estate groups were either Mudburra or Jingili or mixed Mudburra/Jingili. Mudburra and Jingili (the latter often pronounced Jingulu or Jingilu) are distinct languages associated with definable tracts of land. Many of the applicants spoke the Mudburra language fluently, whereas only a small number are fluent in Jingili. In this case the Northern Territory accepted, and the other respondents did not make submissions challenging the view that the applicants constituted a single native title holding community. His Honour found that the evidence supported a finding that they did.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 800">The area for which the determination is sought is, as mentioned above, various allotments in the locality of the town of Elliott. The determination area is part of Mudburra-Jingili country lying to the south and east of the determination area recognised in the matter of King v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 944. (Hereafter referred to as the Newcastle Waters matter. ) The proximity of the determination area to that of Newcastle Waters is relevant to this proceeding as the Applicants are the same estate groups recognised as Native Title Holders by the Newcastle Waters Determination. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1802">22 The lead matter in the Pastoral estate matters was called the Newcastle Waters claim. Judgment was delivered on 26 June 2007: King v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 944. Final orders were made on 26 September 2007. No appeal from that decision has been instituted. 24 At present, I do not consider the power in s 94C(1) is available to be exercised in relation to any of them because the condition for its potential exercise specified in s 94C(1)(e) is not satisfied. It is clear from the matters referred to above that there are no directions in relation to the 44 Pastoral matters referred to in the Registrar's reports which those applicants have failed to comply with. It is also clear that the Court does not presently consider that the applicants in those matters have failed within a reasonable time to take steps to have those claims resolved. The strategy for consideration and resolution of the s 61 claims in the Northern Territory means that now the Court will expect that the decision in King [2007] FCA 944 will provide a foundation or springboard to the progressive resolution of many of the Pastoral matters, including the 44 referred to by the Registrar, in the proximate future. The Court will review the parties' progress in that regard in due course. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1498">1 I gave reasons for judgment in these matters on 26 June 2007: see King v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 944. I ordered the parties to submit a draft determination and related orders within 6 weeks. Both the applicants and the Northern Territory submitted final draft determinations, with the Pastoral respondents primarily in agreement with the draft submitted by the Northern Territory. The final draft determinations left a number of issues to be resolved. The following indicates, in a summary way, how these issues should be resolved. The final determination is Annexure 1 to these reasons. Unless I indicate otherwise, the reference to a clause is to the clause in the final determination. References to "the reasons" are to the reasons given on 26 June 2007.</sentence>
