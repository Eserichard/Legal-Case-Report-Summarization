<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1479">1 On 1 October 2008, the Court dismissed an application by the Applicants under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (AD(JR) Act) for an order of review in respect of a decision by the First Respondent, a Delegate of the Native Title Registrar (the Delegate), made on 14 April 2008 to register an Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) known as the Traveston Crossing Dam Indigenous Land Use Agreement on the register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements (the Register) pursuant to s 24CJ of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (Native Title Act): Fesl v Delegate of the Native Title Registrar [2008] FCA 1469. The Delegate did not take an active part in the proceedings. Instead, and properly in the circumstances, she adopted the stance of abiding the order of the court and not wishing to be heard on any issue save as to costs. Upon the dismissal of the judicial review proceedings, the Delegate, through her solicitors, informed the Court that she sought no order as to costs against the Applicants. </sentence>
