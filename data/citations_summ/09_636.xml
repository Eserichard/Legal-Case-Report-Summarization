<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 1086">14 The principles to be applied in this kind of case have been noted on a number of occasions. As Mr Lyne has pointed out in his submissions, a useful summary of the position is provided in the judgment of Lindgren J in Re Austcorp Group Limited [2009] FCA 636 at paragraph 18:
 

 
 
 "The overlapping considerations affecting the exercise of the discretion whether to extend the convening period may be summarised as follows:
 (a) the Court should recognise the objective of speed of administration that was associated with the introduction of Part 5.3A by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 (Cth) as from 23 June 1993. The Court should also recognise the objectives stated in para 507 of the explanatory memorandum associated with the Bill for that Act, that it was expected that the power to extend the period would be exercised infrequently since it is an important objective of Part 5.3A that creditors be fully informed about the company's position as early as possible and have an opportunity to vote on its future as soon as possible: Mann v Abruzzi Sports Club Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 611 (Young J) at 612; Re Geraldton Building Co Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed); ex parte Trevor [2000] WASC 320 (Owen J) at [5];
 (b) the function of the Court is to strike an appropriate balance between the legislature's expectation that the administration will be a relatively swift and summary procedure, and the requirement that undue speed should not be allowed to prejudice sensible and constructive actions directed towards maximising the return for creditors and any return for shareholders: Re Diamond Press Australia Pty Limited [2001] NSWSC 313 (Barrett J) at [10]; Re Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd [2003] FCA 598 ; (2003) 46 ACSR 77 (Lindgren J) ( Pan Pharmaceuticals ) at [42]; Re New Horizons Corporation; ex parte De Vries [2004] NSWSC 253 (Austin J) at [5];
 (c) the prospects of a better outcome for creditors through a longer period of administration may outweigh the general expectation of a prompt resolution of the administration : Re Fincorp Group Holdings Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 363 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 192 (Barrett J) ( Fincorp ) at [18];
 (d) a particular consideration against the too ready grant of an extension is the fact that while the voluntary administration continues there is an embargo or moratorium on the enforcement of remedies by secured creditors, lessors and others: Fincorp [2007] NSWSC 363 ; 62 ACSR 192 at [4] ; Chamberlain, in the matter of South Wagga Sports and Bowling Club Ltd (Administrator Appointed) [2009] FCA 25 (Jacobson J) at [9];
 (e) the application is to be assessed by reference to whether an extension is necessary to enable the administrators to prepare and provide the report and statements, and, in particular, to arrive at the opinion referred to in s 439A(4), in order to inform creditors adequately so that they will be in a position to decide whether to terminate the administration, execute a deed of company arrangement or place the company in liquidation : Pan Pharmaceuticals [2003] FCA 598 ; (2003) 46 ACSR 77 at [41] ; ABC Learning Centres Limited, in the matter of ABC Learning Centres Limited; application by Walker (No.7) [2009] FCA 454 (Emmett J) ( ABC Learning Centres) at [28];
 (f) it is often desirable that any extension be accompanied by an order under s 447A, permitting the meeting to be held at any time during the convening period as extended: see the order made in Re Daisytek Australia Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 575 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 446 ( Daisytek ) at [10]---[18]. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 468">In Silvia, in the matter of Austcorp Group Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2009] FCA 636 , Lindgren J surveyed the relevant considerations and recognised that lengthy extensions had been granted. His Honour stated: 
 
 
 [19] Lengthy extensions have been granted where the administrator's investigations are complex, see, for example Re AFG Insurances Ltd [2002] NSWSC 803 (Barrett J) (five months); Re Chemeq Ltd (Administrators Appointed) ; ex parte McMaster [2007] WASC 154 (Le Miere J) (almost six months); ABC Learning Centres [2009] FCA 454 (Emmett J) (ten months). 
 
 

  In Re Riviera Group Pty Ltd (admins apptd) (recs and mgrs apptd) [2009] NSWSC 585 ; (2009) 72 ACSR 352 , Austin J at para 11 surveyed the authorities and summarised, at para 13, the reasons given for extension in cases subsequent to Mann v Abruzzi Sports Club Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 611 as follows: 
 
 
 [13] The reasons given for an extension in subsequent cases can be grouped into the following broad categories: 
 
 
 the size and scope of the business: Lombe, Re Babcock &amp; Brown Ltd (admins apptd) [2009] FCA 349 ; Worrell; Re Storm Financial Ltd (recs and mgrs apptd) [2009] FCA 70 ; ABC Learning Centres Ltd, Re of ABC Learning Centres Ltd; application by Walker (No 5) [2008] FCA 1947 ; substantial offshore activities: Lehman Bros Australia Ltd [2008] NSWSC 1132 ; large number of employees with complex entitlements: Re S &amp; D International Pty Ltd (in liq); Malhotra v Tiwari [2005] VSC 496 ; Re Ansett Australia (All admin apptd) and Korda (As admins) [2002] FCA 90 ; complex corporate group structure and intercompany loans: Lombe, Re Babcock &amp; Brown Ltd (admins apptd) [2009] FCA 349 ; Re Octaviar Ltd (admins apptd) (recs and mgrs apptd) [2008] QSC 272 ; Re of LED Builders Pty Ltd (admins apptd); LED Builders Pty Ltd (admins apptd) [2008] NSWSC 633 ; Hall, Re of Australian Capital Reserve Ltd (admins apptd) [2007] FCA 1328 ; complex transactions entered into by the company (eg securities lending or derivatives transactions): In Re Lift Capital Partners Ltd (admins apptd) [2008] NSWSC 446 ; complex prospects of recovery proceedings: Worrel, Re Storm Financial Ltd (admins apptd) [2009] FCA 70 ; Deputy Cmr of Taxation v Wellnora Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1324 ; lack of access to corporate financial records: Sims, Re Destra Corporation Ltd [2008] FCA 2002 ; Fincorp Group Holdings Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 363 ; the time needed to execute an orderly process of disposal of assets: Carter, Re SFM Australasia Pty Ltd (admins apptd) (No 2) [2009] FCA 419 ; ABC Learning Centres Ltd, Re ABC Learning Centres Ltd; application by Walker (No 7) [2009] FCA 454 ; the time needed for thorough assessment of a proposal for a deed of company arrangement: Silvia, Re Austcorp Group Ltd (admins apptd) [2009] FCA 636 ; where the extension will allow sale of the business as a going concern: Lombe Re Australian Discount Retail Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 110 ; Stewart, Re Kleins Franchising Pty Ltd (admins apptd) [2008] FCA 721 ; Uni-Aire Security Pty Ltd (admins apptd, Re of Uni-Aire Security Pty Ltd (admins apptd) [2006] FCA 1423 ; more generally, that additional time is likely to enhance the return for unsecured creditors: Deputy Cmr of Taxation v Scottsdale Homes No 3 Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 190 ; Fitzgerald, Re of Primebroker Securities Ltd (admin apptd) (recs and mgrs apptd) [2008] FCA 1247 ; Ex parte Vouris; Re Marrickville Bowling and Recreation Club Ltd (under Administration) [2008] DCA 622. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] NSWSC 451">14 In exercising the s 439A(6) power, the court should have regard to, and balance, the interests of creditors in a speedy administration and the need to allow sufficient time to administrators to carry out their function properly and maximise the benefit to creditors through a proper administration: Re Diamond Press Australia Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 313 at [10] , Re Austcorp Group Ltd [2009] FCA 636 at [18] , Re The Griffin Coal Mining Co Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 30 at [15] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 30">The Court has jurisdiction to make the extension orders sought by reason of s 439A(6) CA. In exercising that jurisdiction, the Court should have regard to, and balance, the interests of creditors in a speedy administration and the need to allow sufficient time to administrators to carry out their function properly and maximise the benefit to creditors through a proper administration: Re Diamond Press Australia Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 313 at [10] , Re Austcorp Group Ltd [2009] FCA 636 at [18] .  A variety of other reasons which would also justify an extension are categorised by Austin J in Re; Riviera Group Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 585 ; (2009) 72 ACSR 352 at 355, [13] where his Honour said:
