<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 23">Third, as a necessary prerequisite to the development of the means of infringement test, the trial judge distinguished between what he described as the "APRA cases" and the "technology cases". However, and as APRA submitted: 
At the factual level, there is no basis for such a distinction. APRA is inevitably engaged in technological developments impacting the performing right of the APRA Repertoire, rather than merely cases involving the "traditional" performance in public spaces (as in Adelaide Corporation v APRA [1928] HCA 10 ; (1928) 40 CLR 481 , APRA v Canterbury-Bankstown League Club Ltd [1964-5] NSWR 138 , APRA v Jain (1990) 26 FCR 53 and APRA v Metro on George Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1123 ; (2004) 210 ALR 244). Examples are:
 
(a) the music-on-hold litigation culminating in Telstra Corporation Ltd v APRA [1997] HCA 41 ; (1997) 191 CLR 140 ;
 
(b) APRA Ltd v Monster Communications Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1806 ; (2006) 71 IPR 212 , concerning the licences granted by APRA to download ringtones to a user's mobile phone, of which, as at 30 June 2006, there were 47: see at [6]; and
 
(c) the digital downloads determination of the Copyright Tribunal [2009] ACopyT 2 referred to more than thirty entities (notably, Apple) with licences from APRA authorising online downloading of music: [2009] ACopyT 2 at [24] . More importantly, there is no legal basis for the distinction adopted by the primary judge. Some classes of infringing conduct involve digital technology, some do not. True it is that where digital technology is involved, it will be necessary for the Court to hear evidence and make findings as to what precisely occurs, and in particular the matters to which s 101(1A) requires the Court to have regard may involve technically complex and highly contestable issues (cf Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd (Kazaa) [2005] FCA 1242 ; (2005) 220 ALR 1 at [195] - [330]). But that is merely applying identical legal principles to different factual circumstances. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 876">These matters suggest that the person who presents the ticket agrees to be bound by its terms, and to the extent that it effectively imports the provisions of the Act and Rules, those provisions as consideration for Lotteries' promise to pay the prize if it is a winning ticket. As Lord Wilberforce said in New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v AM Salterthwaite &amp; Co Ltd [1974] UKPC 1 ; [1975] AC 154 at 167, the law of contract takes a practical approach in commercial situations "... often at the cost of forcing the facts to fit uneasily into the slots of offer, acceptance and consideration". In Australasian Performing Right Association v Monster Communications Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1806 ; (2006) 71 IPR 212 at 229 [71] I said: 
 
 "The use of the concept of agency to overcome the need for privity is a technique which was described in Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 ; at [79] by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ adopting the words of Lord Bingham of Cornhill (in Homburg Houtimport BV v Agrosin Private Ltd [2003] UKHL 12 ; [2004] 1 AC 715 at 744 as "a deft and commercially-inspired response to technical English rules of contract, particularly those governing privity and consideration". As their Honours went on to note in the case of a stevedore seeking the benefit of a Himalaya clause against a consignee of damaged cargo, courts have been ready to conclude that the carrier was acting with the stevedore's authority.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1298">Counsel for Deckers invites a comparison of the circumstances of the present case with a large number of other cases in which both compensatory and additional damages have been awarded for copyright infringement. Attention was also directed to the quantum of the damages awarded in those cases. They include Aristocrat Technologies , Microsoft Corporation v Glostar Pty Ltd (t/as Downtown Technology Centre) [2003] FCA 210 ; (2003) 57 IPR 518 ; Vivid Entertainment LLC v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FMCA 748 ; Microsoft Corporation v Ezy Loans Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1135 ; (2004) 63 IPR 54 ; Microsoft Corporation v Goodview Electronics Pty Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 578 ; Zero Tolerance Entertainment Inc v Venus Adult Shops Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 155 ; Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 64 IPR 18 ; Bailey v Namol Pty Limited [1994] FCA 1401 ; (1994) 53 FCR 102 ; Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd [1992] FCA 542 ; (1992) 24 IPR 461 ; Foxtel Management Pty Ltd v Mod Shop Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 463 ; (2007) 72 IPR 1 ; Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Monster Communications Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1806 ; (2006) 71 IPR 212 ; and Elwood Clothing Pty Ltd (ACN 079 393 696) v Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd (ACN 052 130 462) (2009) 8 IPR 378. These authorities are of limited assistance. They emphasise the unfettered nature of the discretion conferred on the Court in fixing an appropriate measure of additional damages. They demonstrate that, depending on the circumstances of the case, a significant award of additional damages can be made even though compensatory damages are fixed at a nominal sum; and that additional damages are often fixed at a lower sum than that awarded for compensatory damages. They make it plain that there is no recognised practice of awarding additional damages in an amount equal to or lower than compensatory damages: cf Raben Footwear at 104 (per Tamberlin J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] NSWSC 157">61 The matter was litigated by both parties adopting a number of approaches. At least one common approach was to address submissions as to what a reasonable person subscribing to a basic package plus a tier comprising the Movie Channels would or would not consider to be the retail price for the Movie Channels. The alternative submissions were as follows :
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 i. TMNC contended that such a reasonable person so subscribing to such a basic package plus a tier would consider that the retail price for the movie channels was the price of the whole package, including the price of basic and the price of the tier
 
 [inter alia citing Rares J Australasian Performing Rights Association Limited v Monster Communications Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1806 at [72] . His Honour had held that the ordinary and natural meaning of "retail price" was the price at which a particular service was advertised for sale and applied it in the construction of a licence agreement] 
 
 ii. Optus Vision contended that such a reasonable person would conclude that the retail price was no more than the price of the tier that comprised the movie channels. [the defendant's fuller contention was that if the tier comprised just the movie channels, the retail price would be the price of the tier and that if the tier comprised movie channels and other channels, the retail price would be (no more than) the price of the tier]. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] NSWSC 542">19 It was suggested for NCH that McHugh's right to apply for removal must be exercised within "a reasonable time", for which the judgment of Rares J in Australian Performing Rights Association Ltd v Monster Communications Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1806 was invoked. But the implication of such a limitation would fly in the face of the words "at any time" in clause 14.1, an express provision, and it is of course fundamental that a term is not to be implied if it would be inconsistent with the express terms of the contract. A fortiori , it would be impossible to imply into clause 14,1 a proviso to the effect that the right would exist at any time after termination "but only so long as a s 42 application were not successful", or to that effect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCAFC 38">53 It is necessary to construe an agreement so as to avoid making it commercial nonsense or working commercial inconvenience. The commercial purpose of the provision, that is to say the purpose of a reasonable person in the position of the parties to the contract, is relevant. That in turn requires attention to the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context, and the market in which the parties were operating, as known to both parties: Zhu v Treasurer of New South Wales [2004] HCA 56 ; (2004) 218 CLR 530 at 559 [82] (see too Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Monster Communications Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1806 ; (2006) 71 IPR 212 at 236-237 [105] - [108] ).</sentence>

Here, cl 4.1 would have been understood by a reasonable person in the position of the parties as requiring Edison to insist that any electrical contractor waiting to perform work at its Loy Yang B site, including in the construction of the peaker plant had an EBA with the CEPU. The reasonable person would reject the self serving construction now urged by the CEPU as not reflecting the parties' intention in light of the objective matrix of facts. The CEPU's construction of cl 4.1 should be rejected.
