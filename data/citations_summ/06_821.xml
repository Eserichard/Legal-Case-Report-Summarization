<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 668">Such a legislative purpose is also discernable both from the circumstances in which the amendments arose, and the context in which Items 11 and 12 appear in the Table. This was recognised by Gzell J in P &amp; N at [32]: 
 There is a lot to be said for the submission of the Commissioner that when the compromise was made for a qualified exemption for food to ensure the passage of legislation, as Sundberg J points out Cascade Brewery Co Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 821 ; (2006) 153 FCR 11 at [40] , the legislature seems to have drawn the line between exempt and non-exempt food supplies in favour of food that is fresh, natural or unprocessed. For example, the beverages that are not included in the table to cl 1 of Sch 2 of the GST Act and are therefore not GST-free, include soft drinks and cordials, flavoured milk (Item 2) and flavoured soy milk and rice milk (Item 4). The only carbonated beverages that are GST-free are those satisfying Item 11, and water (Item 14), is GST-free only if it is non-carbonated and without any other additives. 

 First Issue: Whether the Edenvale products consist wholly (Item 11) or at least 90% by volume (Item 12) of the juices of fruits? The phrase 'juices of fruits'
  Reference was made to Cascade Brewery Company Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 821 ; 153 FCR 11 where Sundberg J said at [40]: 
 The reason for the qualified exemption of food from GST is well-known, and was common ground. It was the political compromise reached in order that the GST scheme might become law. The distinction drawn in Totalizator between an exemption directed at a particular person or body and one that encourages a particular activity is applicable here.</sentence>
