200. The words 'in relation to' have a very wide meaning, but like the expression 'in respect of', they do not extend to 'any relationship however tenuous' ... " [181] 
 
 
199. At first instance, [180] Goldberg J had noted that the expression " in relation to " has been the subject of judicial consideration in a variety of contexts and that each is limited in its precedential value by those contexts.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 27">On 30 November 2007 I dismissed the application against Mr Narain I found, relevantly that: 
(a) the letters sent to the Stock Exchange were not statements in relation to a financial product or service; 
 
 
(b) Mr Narain was not personally liable for the sending of the letters to the Stock Exchange, 
 
 
so that Mr Narain did not contravene s 1041H of the Act. I therefore found it unnecessary to make any findings as to the statements in the letters and their contents or as to any liability of Mr Narain under s 180 of the Act: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citrofresh International Ltd [2007] FCA 1873 ; (2007) 164 FCR 333. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCAFC 120">31 First, the primary judge found that Mr Narain did not engage in conduct "in relation to" a financial product. His Honour was of the view that the statements in the announcement on which ASIC relied were not made in relation to shares in the Company but were made in relation to the Company itself or to a product manufactured and sold by it: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citrofresh International Ltd [2007] FCA 1873 at [74] .</sentence>

122. At first sight, my conclusion may appear to be at odds with the principles expressed by Goldberg J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citrofresh International Ltd [155] but, when the principles in his Honour's judgment are analysed, I do not think that it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 370">121 I note that recently, in Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v Citrofresh [2007] FCA 1873 , Goldberg J (at [71]) expressed similar cautions about a too expansive approach to the phrase "in relation to".
