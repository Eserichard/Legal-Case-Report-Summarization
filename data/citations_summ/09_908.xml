<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 152">There are also limited circumstances in which a claim should be considered even though it may not be clearly articulated: NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) (2004) FCAFC 263 , 144 FCR 1 at 18 to 19. Black CJ, French and Selway JJ there expressed the circumstances in which such a case may arise as follows: 
 
 [58] The review process is inquisitorial rather than adversarial. The tribunal is required to deal with the case raised by the material or evidence before it ... There is authority for the proposition that the tribunal is not to limit its determination to the "case" articulated by an applicant if evidence and material which it accepts raise a case not articulated ... By way of example, if a claim of apprehended persecution is based upon membership of a particular social group the tribunal may be required in its review function to consider a group definition open on the facts but not expressly advanced by the applicant ... It has been suggested that the unarticulated claim must be raised "squarely" on the material available to the tribunal before it has a statutory duty to consider it ... The use of the adverb "squarely" does not convey any precise standard but it indicates that a claim not expressly advanced will attract the review obligation of the tribunal when it is apparent on the face of the material before the tribunal. Such a claim will not depend for its exposure on constructive or creative activity by the tribunal. 
 

 
Their Honours there also went on to approve the observations of Selway J in SGBB .
