<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 988">Having regard to the above, our client submits that the period within which the first applicant was required to lodge his application to the Tribunal should be calculated as follows: (a) the date of the delegate's decision was 20 April 2010; (b) the date on which the first applicant is taken to have received the letter notifying him of the delegate's decision, being 7 working days after the date of the delegate's decision (and noting that 26 April 2010 was a public holiday), was 30 April 2010; and (c) the date by which the first applicant was required to lodge his application to the Tribunal, being 21 days after 30 April 2010, was 21 May 2010. 7. Our client notes that the interpretation of the applicable provisions set out above is supported by the decision of Siopis J in Keo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 676 ; (2009) 177 FCR 479 at [3] to [10]. 8. Our client further submits that, as the Tribunal was correct to find that the first applicant's application had been lodged within the time allowed, no issue arose which our client ought to have brought to the Court's attention at the directions hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1104">I have dealt with the foregoing matters in a little detail to dispel any impression which might otherwise be generated that the appellants had been dealt with harshly and in an overly technical manner. However, the obstacle which faces them in their appeal to this Court is even more substantial. Section 476A(3) of the Act prohibits an appeal to this Court from a judgment of the FMCA refusing to extend time under s 477 of the Act. It is competent for the Parliament to limit the jurisdiction of this Court in that way (see SZICV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 39 ; (2007) 158 FCR 260 ; Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 ; (2007) 162 FCR 299 ; SZAJB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 75 ; [2008] FCAFC 75 ; (2008) 168 FCR 410 ; Keo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 676 ; (2009) 177 FCR 479). The discussion in the cases referred to concerned the terms of s 477 of the Act in an earlier form but the principle applied yields the same conclusion in the present case. The jurisdiction of this Court has been effectively excluded if, as occurred in the present case, an application for judicial review is dismissed because it is brought out of time and no extension of time is granted by the FMCA. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 879">Before 15 March 2009, s 477 of the Act imposed strict time limits on applications to the FMCA for judicial review of decisions of the RRT. Such an application was required to be made within 28 days of the actual notification of a decision of the RRT or (if an extension to this effect was granted) within a further 56 days. If a relevant application had not been made within the 84 days allowed by s 477 in total, relief against a decision such as that made by the RRT on 11 November 2008 was statute barred ( SZICV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 39 ; (2007) 158 FCR 260 ; Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 ; [2007] FCA 591 ; (2007) 162 FCR 299 ; SZAJB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 75 ; (2008) 168 FCR 410 ; Keo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 676 ; (2009) 177 FCR 479). </sentence>
