<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 238">On 13 November 2006 Tracey J of the Federal Court of Australia dismissed the appeal ( SZIJA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1484). Again, it is apparent from Tracey J's decision that he had regard to the decision of the Tribunal. In particular, Tracey J noted that: " the task of the Tribunal is to come to a judgment, based on the evidence before it, as to whether an applicant might face persecution for Convention reasons if returned to his or her country of origin. Any such judgment must, however, be based on evidence. The Tribunal in this case, found itself in the unhappy position of having insufficient evidence before it to enable it to form the necessary judgment one way or another. In these circumstances it could not engage in conjecture or surmise. " </sentence>
