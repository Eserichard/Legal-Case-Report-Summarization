Mr. Brett said that he came into the matter shortly prior to the trial, and that there was a need at that stage for the preparation of statements of witnesses. Mr. Brett also said that the evidence of a Christine McIlwee was important to Mr. Coggin's case. That is confirmed by the decision of Heerey J in the Federal Court: see Coggin v Telstar Finance Company (Q) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 191 @ [20] to [25]. </sentence>
