<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 56">The finding in the above paragraph is a credit finding based on the Tribunal's observation of the Applicant's demeanour while he was giving evidence to the Tribunal. Such findings are a factual finding and a matter for the Tribunal in par excellence : Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Re; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at 67. When the Tribunal makes a credit finding it is entitled to have regard to and base findings on the Applicant's demeanour while giving evidence: Re Refugee Review Tribunal, Re; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at 34. Particularly, as the Federal Court has held, where the Tribunal finds as to an Applicant's credibility not made on demeanour alone: SZCOS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 570 at 18. [18] The Tribunal was entitled to have regard to and base findings on the appellant's demeanour while giving evidence ( Re Refugee Review Tribunal, Re; Ex parte H (2001) 179 ALR 425 at [34]; W148/00 A v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (2001) 185 ALR 703 at [64]). However, in assessing the appellant's credibility, the Tribunal's findings were not made on demeanour alone. The Tribunal assessed the appellant's claims and made findings on credibility that it explained; based on its observation of the appellant, the way he presented his claims, the lack of consistency that it discerned in the claims made and what it found to be implausible. Those were findings of fact for the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 909">The decision is a credit finding based on the Tribunal's observations of the Applicant's oral and written evidence that was provided to the Tribunal. It is well established that credit findings are a factual finding and a matter for the Tribunal "par excellence" ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Re; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at [67] ). Further, the Tribunal's findings as to the Applicant's credibility were not made on demeanour alone ( SZCOS v MIAC [2008] FCA 570 at [18] ). The Application cannot be sustained and consequently, the Application should be dismissed with costs. 
 I certify that the preceding twenty-eight (28) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Lloyd-Jones FM

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 309">The Tribunal also considered whether the appellant would suffer persecution if he returned to Pakistan. As it was not satisfied that the appellant had suffered any past harm for a Convention reason as claimed, the Tribunal found that there was no credible evidence upon which it could find that there was a real chance that he would suffer Convention-related harm in the reasonably foreseeable future if he returned to Pakistan. The Tribunal properly had regard to the probability that the appellant suffered harm in the past as he claimed in determining whether there is a real chance that a similar event will occur in the future ( Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 576). The appellant did not raise any particular reasons why he would be more susceptible to harm in Pakistan now than he had been in the past. On the basis that the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant suffered harm in the past at all, by reason of being a moderate Muslim or because he had spoken publicly against the TNSM, it was open for the Tribunal to conclude that there was no real chance that he would suffer harm by reason of being a moderate Muslim, who did or did not speak out, in the reasonably foreseeable future if he returned to Pakistan. The Tribunal concluded that it was not satisfied that the appellant attracted the adverse attention of the TNSM in Swat or that he attracted adverse attention because of the matters he related as being anti-extremist or, put another way, moderate. The Tribunal was in no doubt that nothing in the appellant's history gave rise to a well-founded fear of persecution ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam (1999) 93 FCR 220 at [68] per Sackville J, North J agreeing; SZCOS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 570 at [48] per Bennett J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 145">Nor was the Tribunal under any obligation to assess the applicant's claimed history or any component of it, including the interrelationship of land developers and government agencies, upon a hypothesis that its findings might have been wrong in finding that the applicant had not been involved in any activities which gave rise to past persecution and might give rise to future persecution (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Guo (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 575-576, Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 544-545, Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 719 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 at 239-241, Applicants A233 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCAFC 296 at [11] - [14], SZCOS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 570 at [42] - [53]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1332">In respect of fourth ground of the original Application, the Federal Magistrate noted that it is now well established that the Tribunal is not obliged to consider an applicant's claims upon the hypothesis that they are based on truth, if it has arrived at firm conclusions to the contrary. The Federal Magistrate cited Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam and Others [1999] FCA 719 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 at 239---241, Applicants A233 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCAFC 296 at [11] - [14] and SZCOS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 570 at [42] - [53] in support of this contention. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1316">The second ground of appeal appears to raise concerns about the application of the "real chance test". It is well established that the Tribunal was entitled to reject the appellant's claims on credibility grounds and, having done so, was not required to proceed to apply the "real chance test": see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 719 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 at [60] --- [67], and SZCOS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 570 at [47] --- [48] per Bennett J. In this case, since the Tribunal found in quite clear terms that the appellant's claims were not credible and fabricated, there was, therefore, no obligation on it to proceed to consider the application of the "real chance test". It follows that the second ground of appeal also has no merit and must be rejected. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 857">Ground 4 appears to present a contention that the Tribunal was bound to have been left in doubt about the truth of the applicant's claims, and then to have given him the benefit of the doubt pursuant to the 'real chance test'. However, it is now well established that the Tribunal is not obliged to consider the applicant's claims upon the hypothesis that they were based on truth, if it has arrived at firm conclusions to the contrary (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 719 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 at 239---241, Applicants A233 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCAFC 296 at [11] ---[14], and SZCOS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 570 at [42] - [53]). In the present case, I can detect no doubt attaching to the Tribunal's rejection of the applicant's claims, and I can therefore find no error in its application of the real chance test. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 679">The second ground is obscurely worded, but appears to contend that the Tribunal misapplied the "real chance test" by failing to give the benefit of the doubt to the applicant in relation to her claimed history. However, very well established authorities allow the Tribunal to put at the forefront of its consideration whether it is satisfied as to a claimed past history before it applies the real chance test in relation to a risk of future harm (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Guo (1997) 191 CLR 559 , Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 719 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 , and SZCOS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 570 at [42] - [53]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 539">Putting aside this inconsistency within Ground 1, I can detect no error by the Tribunal in relation to its findings about the truthfulness of the applicant's refugee claims, nor any obligation on the Tribunal to consider the hypothesis that its adverse view of the applicant's credibility might be wrong. The Tribunal made clear findings on the evidence, and gave reasons which were rational and open to it on the material for forming a positive opinion that it was not satisfied as to the claimed history. In those circumstances, on current authorities it was not obliged to consider the applicant's evidence on the hypothesis that the Tribunal's factual conclusions might be wrong (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Guo (1997) 191 CLR 559 as discussed in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 719 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 at 239---241, Applicants A233 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCAFC 296 at [11] - [14], and SZCOS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 570 at [42] - [53] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 484">Insofar as it might be said that the Tribunal had regard to the applicant's demeanour in coming to a decision about his credit, it has been said that it is open to a Tribunal to do so (see SZCOS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 570). In any event the Tribunal gave reasons for its findings, relating not only to the rehearsed and contrived nature of the applicant's evidence but also to the implausibility of explanations which it did not accept, the fact that it found certain explanations to be fabricated and the evidence that the applicant himself gave in relation to the circumstances in which and reasons for which he obtained a passport, his intention to travel to the United Kingdom and what occurred after he came to Australia. The fact that the Tribunal did not accept the applicant's claims does not establish bias or other jurisdictional error and I note that there is no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal making a wrong finding of fact ( Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [137] ). As no jurisdictional error has been established the application must be dismissed.

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 1177">Guo , and Federal Court authorities which have explained its effects, allow the Tribunal to be satisfied that there is no 'real chance' of future persecution, if it is left in no doubt that the claimant has failed to satisfy it as to any relevant history which might give rise to a risk of persecution (cf. Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingham (1999) 93 FCR 719 at 239 --- 241, Applicants A233 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCAFC 296 at [11] ---[14], and SZCOS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 570 at [42] - [53]). However, it is important for the Tribunal not to confuse its fact-finding about the probable occurrence of the applicant's claimed past history, with its predictions about future risks once it has performed that fact-finding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 1022">Bennett J considered the authorities on the "real chance" test in SZCOS v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 570 at [42] - [44]: "In Chan, McHugh J explained that a person can have a well-founded fear of persecution even though the possibility of the persecution occurring is as small as a 10 per cent chance and even if the evidence does not show that the persecution is more likely than not to occur (at 429). In support of his argument that the Tribunal applied the wrong test (the probability test) to his evidence, the appellant points to the High Court decision in Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Guo (1997) 191 CLR 559. In Guo , the High Court emphasised that the "real chance" test is not a substitute for the Convention term "well-founded fear" (at 572).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 904">84 Reference was made to Sackville J's leading judgment in Rajalingam where 'what if I am wrong? ' terminology had been used. In SZCOS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 570 Bennett J referred to Sackville J's distillation of principle in Rajalingam as follows, at [46] and [48]:
 '46 In Rajalingam Sackville J, with whom North J agreed, discussed the various observations concerning the obligation of the Tribunal to consider, in its assessment of well-founded fear ..., whether there is "real doubt" that findings of fact as to past events were correct. At [60] Sackville J distilled those observations into the principle that there are circumstances in which the Tribunal must take into account the possibility that alleged past events occurred, even though it finds that those events probably did not occur. If the Tribunal makes an adverse finding in relation to a material claim of an appellant but is unable to make the claim with confidence, it must proceed to assess the claim on the basis that the claim may possibly be true.</sentence>
