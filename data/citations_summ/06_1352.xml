(g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial;
 
(h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects;

In my assessment of these proceedings I have also considered the useful summary provided by Gilmour J in Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 (" Dandaven ") at [5] and [6] which was relied on by Foster J in Wang v Anying Group Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1500 , at [44]. In Dandaven, Gilmour J said: Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] . Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: 
(a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings;
 
(b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; 
 
(c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; 
 
(d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success.</sentence>

However one might view Ms Lin's claims, it is plain that they have been brought too late for the purposes of any limitation provision and must fail. Exercising the caution which is necessary before concluding that a litigant should be summarily prevented from pursuing a cause of action, I am nonetheless satisfied that the proceedings should be dismissed because there is no likelihood that Ms Lin will be able to prosecute them successfully: see also Boston Commercial Services Pty Limited v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 at 731 [44] - [46] . </sentence>

Where the evidence may have an ambivalent character or where it is likely that contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed, it may be the case that there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s 31A ( Boston Commercial at [45] per Rares J). </sentence>

But he went on to say that at [44]:
 
 "In a case to which s 31A applies, where there is a real issue of fact to be decided in the sense identified in the above principle, and, possibly, where there is a real issue of law of a similar kind, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. And, one must be mindful that in Hocking v Bell (1945) 71 CLR at 487, Dixon J said that in effect, every judge who had heard the matter (through four trials, two Full Court appeals and, to that point, the appeal to the High Court) would have formed the view that the plaintiff should have failed had they been able to decide the facts, yet the Privy Council restored the second jury verdict in her favour and so concluded the litigation. This raises a very real question, as to what reasonable prospects are for present purposes. "

<sentence id="cs28" from="[2010] FCA 283">Before considering the particular issues in this matter, it is convenient to mention how the exercise of the power conferred by s 31A should be approached. In the present case, the question is whether any of the respondents have no reasonable prospect of defending the proceedings or any part of the proceedings. How this question should be answered was recently discussed by Foster J in Wang v Anying Group Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1500 at [43] : 
 
 The critical words of s 31A(1), when applied to the present case, require me to be satisfied that the respondents have "... no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding ...". The following principles may be extracted from the authorities: 
 

 
 
 (a) The moving party does not have to demonstrate that the defence is hopeless or unarguable; 
 

 
 
 (b) The Court must consider the pleadings and the evidence with a "critical eye" in order to see whether the respondent party has evidence of sufficient quality and weight to be able to succeed at trial ( Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 at [23] (p 382) (per Finkelstein J)); 
 

 
 
 (c) The respondent party is not obliged to present its whole case in order to defeat the summary judgment applicant but must at least present a sufficient outline of the evidence in order to enable the Court to come to a preliminary view about the merits for the purpose of considering the statutory test in s 31A(1)(b) ( Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; 167 FCR 372 at [22] (p 382) (per Finkelstein J)); and 
 
 
 
 
 (d) The test may require greater scrutiny of the pleadings and evidence in some cases than in others. In my judgment, the words of s 31A(1) compel a flexible approach. The real question in every case is not so much whether there is any issue that could arguably go to trial but rather whether there is any issue that should be permitted to go to trial. This seems to be the approach of Finkelstein J in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; 167 FCR 372 and of Gordon J in the same case (as to which see [123]---[134] (pp 406---409)), although Rares J in that case at [73]---[74] (p 394) and in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 esp at [45] (p 731) favoured a test which is much closer to the older test articulated in authorities decided under Rules of Court expressed in terms different from the language of s 31A(1)).

 Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] . Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: 
 
 
 
 (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings;
 (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; 
 (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; 
 (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. In my judgment, the words of s 31A(1) compel a flexible approach. The real question in every case is not so much whether there is any issue that could arguably go to trial but rather whether there is any issue that should be permitted to go to trial.

It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; 
 (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial;

  In my judgment, the words of s 31A(1) compel a flexible approach. The real question in every case is not so much whether there is any issue that could arguably go to trial but rather whether there is any issue that should be permitted to go to trial.

<sentence id="cs34" from="[2010] FMCA 40">A little later in his reasons [at paragraph 57], His Honour said: "The purpose of introducing s.31A into the Court's armoury or dealing with litigation which ought not be allowed to go to trial was to expand the capacity of the Court summarily to dismiss matters. " 29. In deciding these applications I take into account what Rares J said in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 esp at 731 [45] concerning the test to be applied under s.31A of the FCA Act [and therefore s.17A of the FM Act] which he paraphrased in Jefferson Ford as being whether there is "a real issue of fact or a real issue of law capable of being decided in (the applicant's) favour then, subject to the Court's discretion to determine the question of law, the matter ought to be allowed to go to trial in the ordinary way". [ Jefferson Ford supra at paras.73 and 74. ] 30. One such principle is that the moving party bears the onus of persuading the Court that the opponent has no reasonable prospect of success; d) The trial Court's decision to grant summary judgment is to be made as a question of law, not as the exercise of a discretion; e) Where there is a real issue of fact relevant to a pleaded cause of action, it is unlikely that that part of the proceeding has no prospect of success. A real issue of law does not necessarily preclude summary judgment; and f) In determining whether a real issue of fact exists such as to preclude summary judgment, the Court must draw all reasonable inferences --- but only reasonable inferences --- in favour of the non-moving party.

In relation to this final principle His Honour went on to say: "I emphasise "reasonable" because it is on this point that the lowering of the bar affected by s.31A becomes clear. By distinguishing between "hopeless" cases and those without reasonable prospects for success, the statute makes clear that the Court need not (indeed, must not) refuse summary judgment on the basis of a factual dispute said to arise only from a plausible, as opposed to a reasonable, inference.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs35" from="[2010] FMCA 33">In Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Co of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 the Full Federal Court was not unanimous as to the appropriate test to apply on an application for summary dismissal. Rares J, a member of the Full Court, had earlier expressed the test in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 , as follows, at [42], [44] and [45]: "[42] I am of the opinion that, properly construed, s31A(2)(b) requires a person moving a motion for summary disposal (the moving party) to satisfy the court that there is no reasonable prospect of the party claiming relief (the plaintiff) successfully prosecuting the proceeding or the part of the proceeding in question. ... 
 [44] In a case to which s31A applies, where there is a real issue of fact to be decided in the sense identified in the above principle, and, possibly, where there is a real issue of law of a similar kind, it is obviously appropriate that the matter does to trial. ... 
 
 [45] I am of opinion that in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s31A, the court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing the proceedings where, in accordance with the principles in Hocking (1947), contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed. As soon as the evidence may have such an ambivalent character prior to a final determination, I am of the opinion that then, as a matter of law, at that point there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s31A. Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, the moving party will not have discharged its onus to enliven the discretion to authorise a summary termination of the proceedings which s31A envisages. ..."

<sentence id="cs36" from="[2009] FCA 1478">However, in our respectful opinion, the preconditions for the exercise of the relevant power, which require value judgments to be made in the absence of a full and complete factual matrix and full argument thereon, lead us to the view that a discretion is reposed in the judge hearing the relevant application to grant summary judgment. 
 [29] The concept of 'no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting ' a proceeding, which is a relevant issue where summary dismissal is sought under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act , was addressed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd (ACN 114 658 070) v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (ACN 070 396 020) [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720.

  The critical words of s 31A(1), when applied to the present case, require me to be satisfied that the respondents have "... no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding ...". The following principles may be extracted from the authorities: 
(a) The moving party does not have to demonstrate that the defence is hopeless or unarguable;
 
(b) The Court must consider the pleadings and the evidence with a "critical eye" in order to see whether the respondent party has evidence of sufficient quality and weight to be able to succeed at trial ( Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 at [23] (p 382) (per Finkelstein J));
 
(c) The respondent party is not obliged to present its whole case in order to defeat the summary judgment applicant but must at least present a sufficient outline of the evidence in order to enable the Court to come to a preliminary view about the merits for the purpose of considering the statutory test in s 31A(1)(b) ( Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; 167 FCR 372 at [22] (p 382) (per Finkelstein J)); and 
 
(d) The test may require greater scrutiny of the pleadings and evidence in some cases than in others. In my judgment, the words of s 31A(1) compel a flexible approach. The real question in every case is not so much whether there is any issue that could arguably go to trial but rather whether there is any issue that should be permitted to go to trial. This seems to be the approach of Finkelstein J in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; 167 FCR 372 and of Gordon J in the same case (as to which see [123]---[134] (pp 406---409)), although Rares J in that case at [73]---[74] (p 394) and in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 esp at [45] (p 731) favoured a test which is much closer to the older test articulated in authorities decided under Rules of Court expressed in terms different from the language of s 31A(1)). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs44" from="[2009] FMCA 957">However as Tamberlin J stated in Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 at [13] : 
 In a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading: see Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v G E Capital Finance Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [45] . The underlying principle is that the need for a summary judgment must be clear before the court will intervene to prevent a plaintiff submitting a case for determination in the usual way. Once it appears that there is a real issue to be determined, whether it be of fact or law, and that the rights of the parties depend on it, the court should not terminate the action by way of summary judgment. As Barwick CJ said in General Steel at 129-130, great care must be exercised to be sure that under the guise of achieving expeditious finality a plaintiff is not improperly deprived of the opportunity to have his or her case tried by the appointed tribunal. The general principle that a person should not lightly be shut out from a hearing is cogent --- the onus on the party applying for summary judgment is heavy. 
  In Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ACN 123 123 124) v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Limited (in liq) (Formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Limited) [2006] FCA 1416 in referring to the principles relevant to summary dismissal under s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act (see Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd (ACN 114 658 070) v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (ACN 070 396 020) (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; [2006] FCA 1352 at [31] --- [48]) Jacobson J stated at [32] --- [33]: ... summary dismissal applications are to be determined on the pleadings and any evidence before the Court; but at the heart of the exercise is the assessment on incomplete materials, of the prospects of success if the matter proceeds to a final hearing; Boston Commercial at [38], [48].

After considering the authorities, his Honour concluded that where there is a real issue of fact to be decided it is appropriate that the matter goes to trial. His Honour described the situation of there being a real issue of fact as being where the evidence is not all one way so that only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, as considered in Hocking v Bell (1947) 75 CLR 125 at 130-131. His Honour also suggested that the matter ought to go to trial where there is a real issue of law of a similar kind. In his Honour's view: ...in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s 31A, the court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing the proceedings where, in accordance with the principles in Hocking (1947), contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed. As soon as the evidence may have such an ambivalent character prior to a final determination, I am of opinion that then, as a matter of law, at that point there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s 31A. Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, the moving party will not have discharged its onus to enliven the discretion to authorise a summary termination of the proceedings which s 31A envisages. (at 731 [45])  In Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 195 Greenwood J was satisfied that there was no prospect of the applicant succeeding in the proceedings were they allowed to go to trial in the ordinary way and thus there was a high degree of certainty as to the ultimate outcome. That degree of certainty was informed not just by deficiencies in the pleading but by reason of the weight to be given to factors discussed in the reasons for judgment. His Honour described his conclusions at [64] in the following terms: Perhaps the test in determining a reasonable prospect of successful prosecution of a proceeding is whether there is a demonstrated ' real (as opposed to fanciful) issue of fact to be decided' (Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 , per Rares J [31]---[48]). However, the 'real issue of fact' must be framed within a comprehensible cause of action (in respect of which the applicant has standing) so that findings of fact in favour of the applicant give rise to a recognised remedy. </sentence>

 (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed;

<sentence id="cs48" from="[2009] FMCA 769">Mr Boensch asks me to strike out the applicant's claim under s.121 on the grounds that as it stands (without the amendments) the Trustee has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the claim. Rule 13.10 in the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 is in identical form to Order 20 Rule 5 of the Federal Court Rules which itself is based upon s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 . In Commissioner of Taxation v Grimaldi (No. 5) [2009] FCA 765 Graham J explained the background to s.31A at [28 --- 37]. His Honour noted that the effect of s.31A was to soften the test for a successful application for summary judgment reminding us at [31] that paragraph 22 of the relevant explanatory memorandum said: " Section 31A(3) provides that for the purposes of giving summary judgment a proceeding or part of a proceeding or a defence to a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success. " 
His Honour noted the comments of Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [44] :
 
 "In a case to which s31A applies, where there is a real issue of fact to be decided in the sense identified in the above principle [a reference to [43] and to Hocking v Bell [1945] HCA 16 ; (1945) 71 CLR 430 at 441 --- 442] and, possibly, where there is a real issue of law of a similar kind, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial.

In the instant case the applicant asserts a real issue of fact and law to be tried, namely solvency of Mr Boensch at the time he entered into the Trust arrangements.

I do not think it necessary to enter into the interesting questions of what the particular standard imposed by the new version of s 31A might be. This is because whatever the bar is, the current applications pass well beneath it. That is, I find that they are, despite their creativity, devoid of merit. It follows, in my opinion, that there should be orders under s 31A.

This is not a case in which contested evidence is involved: cf Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd (ACN 114 658 070) v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (ACN 070 396 020) [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 at 731 (per Rares J). In such a case the Court will approach the potential application of s 31A with some caution. USQ bases its application for summary judgment on a straight forward question of law: whether the AAT, as it held, lacks jurisdiction to entertain Ms Luck's application. The answer is, in my view, clear. Ms Luck has pursued her application for access to documents under both Commonwealth and Queensland freedom of information legislation.

<sentence id="cs75" from="[2008] FCA 1490">36 Professor McAleer contended that the principles to be applied in determining the University's application for summary judgment are those set out in the following observations of Rares J in the case of Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 at 731, at [44]-[45]:
 In a case to which s 31A applies, where there is a real issue of fact to be decided in the sense identified in the above principle, and, possibly, where there is a real issue of law of a similar kind, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. And, one must be mindful that in Hocking [v Bell] (1945) [1945] HCA 16 ; [71 CLR 430] at 487, Dixon J said that, in effect, every judge who had heard the matter (through four trials, two Full Court appeals and, to that point, the appeal to the High Court) would have formed the view that the plaintiff should have failed had they been able to decide the facts, yet the Privy Council restored the second jury verdict in her favour and so concluded the litigation. This raises a very real question, as to what reasonable prospects are for present purposes. I am of opinion that in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s 31A, the court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing the proceedings where, in accordance with the principles in Hocking [v Bell] (1947) [1947] HCA 54 ; [75 CLR 125] , contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed. As soon as the evidence may have such an ambivalent character prior to a final determination, I am of opinion that then, as a matter of law, at that point there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s 31A. Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, the moving party will not have discharged its onus to enliven the discretion to authorise a summary termination of the proceedings which s 31A envisages. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs76" from="[2008] FMCA 1374">Conversely, support for the approach taken by Rares J can be found in Australian Inernational Pilots Assn v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 441 at [23] (decided on 9 November 2006) per Tracey J. The authorities were reviewed by Jacobson J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 (decided 2 November 2006) at [30]-[33] where His Honour said: ... The authorities relating to the proper construction and effect of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act were exhaustively reviewed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [31] --- [48]. His Honour stated the relevant principles at [45] and they may be summarised as follows: &#8226; In assessing whether there are reasonable prospects of success, the Court must be cautious not to do an injustice by summary dismissal. &#8226; There will be reasonable prospects of success if there is evidence which may be reasonably believed so as to enable the party against whom summary judgment is sought to succeed at the final hearing. ' Finally, in Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 , Tamberlin J considered the meaning of the phrase "no reasonable prospects of success" at [12]-[13] in the following terms, which appear to me to build a bridge between the two strands of opinion in the Federal Court: Section 31A of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) was introduced to impose a lower requirement to dismiss an action by way of summary judgment than that which was imposed in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner of Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. In that case, the requirement was expressed in terms of "manifestly groundless" or "obviously untenable". In a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading: see Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v G E Capital Finance Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [45] . The underlying principle is that the need for a summary judgment must be clear before the court will intervene to prevent a plaintiff submitting a case for determination in the usual way. Once it appears that there is a real issue to be determined, whether it be of fact or law, and that the rights of the parties depend on it, the court should not terminate the action by way of summary judgment. If that view is correct, there is a firm basis for believing that Finkelstein J may have overlooked the significance of the new section. The alternative approach taken in the Federal Court is to apply the section on a basis consistent with general law principles. In Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia [2006] FCA 1352 (decided on 16 October 2006) Rares J considered the available authorities to that point and, at [42], said: I am of opinion that properly construed, s 31A(2)(b) requires a person moving a motion for summary disposal ('the moving party') to satisfy the Court that there is no reasonable prospect of the party claiming relief ('the plaintiff') successfully prosecuting the proceeding or the part of the proceeding in question. Experience shows that there are cases which appear to be almost bound to fail yet they succeed. As Dixon CJ once said ( Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith v Scales [1962] HCA 19 ; (1962) 107 CLR 9 at 20): 'Experience of forensic contests should confirm the truth of the common saying that one story is good until another is told...' His Honour continued at [44]-[48]: In a case to which s 31A applies, where there is a real issue of fact to be decided in the sense identified in the above principle, and, possibly, where there is a real issue of law of a similar kind, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial.</sentence>

24 Although there has been debate about whether the word "may" in s 31A(2) vests in the Court a power conditional on certain facts being found or discretion (see, for example, Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd (2008) 167 FCR 372 ; [2008] FCAFC 60 at [127] --- [128] and JF Keir Pty Ltd v Sparks [2008] FCA 611 at [12] ), certain aspects of the operation of the provision are clear. First, s 31A(3) , in terms, discloses that s 31A(2) involves a less stringent test than that applicable at common law for summary dismissal. Secondly, and as Rares J observed in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; [2006] FCA 1352 at [46] , " s 31A regulates the attainment of justice by creating an entitlement in a party to be protected from claims or defences which fail to meet the threshold prescribed in the section". Thirdly, and again as Rares J said in Boston Commercial Services at [45], "in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s 31A , the court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing the proceedings where... contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed. As soon as the evidence may have such an ambivalent character prior to a final determination, I am of opinion that then, as a matter of law, at that point there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s 31A. Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, the moving party will not have discharged its onus to enliven the discretion to authorise a summary termination of the proceedings which s 31A envisages". This is consistent with the statement by Tamberlin J in Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCA 875 at [14] that "... it is essential that the Court must be careful not to do an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings, or denying an applicant an opportunity to ventilate their case ...". Fourthly, and as Lindgren J noted in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 160 FCR 298 ; [2007] FCA 511 at [50] , s 31A "is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs78" from="[2008] FMCA 1340">Similarly, and having regard to the nature of this Court, its rules (albeit preceding r.13.10(a) of the FMC Rules in its current form), functions and "philosophy", Lander J has observed that this Court ought be cautious, and not summarily dismiss a claim unless the matter be "clear, beyond any doubt": Rana v University of South Australia [2004] FCA 559 ; (2004) 136 FCR 344 at 355; [2004] FCA 559 at para 75 ("Rana"). 20. In Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd: (2006) 70 IPR 146 ; [2006] FCA 1352 ("Boston Commercial") Rares J gave detailed consideration to the phrase "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding" (in that case for the purposes of s.31A of the FCA Act). Rares J noted that conceptually the test had "some similarity to the test at common law for determining whether a jury properly instructed could reach a verdict for the plaintiff. ": Boston Commercial IPR at 156 per Rares J; FCA at para 43 per Rares J. However, because it was the first time the pleadings had been "subjected to curial scrutiny" Tracey J determined that the "preferable course" was to strike out the further amended Statement of Claim, and grant leave to file a further amended Statement of Claim: Pilots Association at para 34 per Tracey J. Whilst neither the reasons for judgment nor the order make it plain it seems that those orders must have been made under O.11r16 of the Federal Court Rules which Tracey J had adverted to when considering section 31A: Pilots Association at paras 23 and 34 per Tracey J. 
 27. In the Federal Court in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Limited (In Liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Limited) [2006] FCA 1416 Jacobson J said at para 30: "The authorities relating to the proper construction and effect of s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act were exhaustively reviewed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [31] - [48]. His Honour stated the relevant principles at [45] and they may be summarised as follows: In assessing whether there are reasonable prospects of success, the Court must be cautious not to do an injustice by summary dismissal. There will be reasonable prospects of success if there is evidence which may be reasonably believed so as to enable the party against whom summary judgment is sought to succeed at the final hearing. Here the Court does not find the existence of evidence of an ambivalent character. There is no evidence, apart from the applicant's beliefs, of the imputation of a psychiatric disability or the existence of the alleged programmes or any other matters alleged by the applicant. Paragraph 66 refers to the decision in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA [2006] FCA 1352 ; 1352 ; 70 IPR 146 that " if evidence might reasonably be believed one way or another " there are reasonable prospects of success. Here there is no evidence of the applicant that could be probative of the claims she makes. The applicant's assertions may not be reasonably believed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs79" from="[2008] FMCA 1146">Justice remains the paramount consideration in determining whether a party should be shut out from litigating an issue if that issue is fairly arguable, and any power to grant a dispensation, such as the varying or setting aside of judgments or orders, must be exercised with the paramount consideration in mind. [43] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs80" from="[2008] FCA 784">13 I am confident in saying that the Court has given to Mr Wills extraordinary leeway and certainly far more leeway than would otherwise be afforded to an applicant represented by a solicitor or counsel. He has, however, been unable to articulate in any comprehensible manner, as a matter of fact and law, any cause of action upon the material which is before the Court. I have had regard to the recent decision of Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 particularly at [31]-[48], where his Honour set out the relevant principles by reference to the proper construction and effect of s 31A. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs81" from="[2008] FCA 1189">364 Rights to sue for the tort of negligent misrepresentation ( Poulton v The Commonwealth (1953) 89 CLR 540 at 602 per Williams, Webb and Kitto JJ) and for loss or damage under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act in respect of a contravention of s 52 are not assignable: Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 at 732-734 [51] - [57] per myself; BHP Coal Pty Ltd v O &amp; K Orenstein &amp; Koppel AG [2008] QSC 141 at [76] per McMurdo J.

<sentence id="cs82" from="[2008] FMCA 1018">Section 17A was inserted into the Court's statute by the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 and commenced on 1 December 2005. In Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 Rares J considered s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 which is equivalent to s.17A of the Federal Magistrates Act . His Honour concluded that where there is a real issue of fact to be decided, it was appropriate that the matter went to trial. His Honour described the situation of there being a real issue of fact as being where the evidence is not all one way so that only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, as considered in Hocking v Bell [1947] HCA 54 ; (1947) 75 CLR 125 at 130 --- 131. His Honour also suggested that the matter ought to go to trial where there is a real issue of law of a similar kind. In his Honour's view: ... in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s.31A, the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing the proceedings where, in accordance with the principles in Hocking v Bell [1947] HCA 54 ; (1947) 75 CLR 125 , contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed. As soon as the evidence may have such an ambivalent character prior to a final determination, I am of opinion that then, as a matter of law, at that point there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s.31A. Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, the moving party will not have discharged its onus to enliven the discretion to authorize a summary termination of the proceedings which s.31A envisages. [at 45] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs83" from="[2008] FMCA 1104">I have borne in mind the caution to be exercised in relation to an application for summary dismissal and that an order which prevents a party from pursuing a claim should only be made in a very clear case (see Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91). I have also borne in mind the test applicable under r.13.10(a), as to which see the discussion by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 in relation to the assessment of reasonable prospects of success for the purposes of the similarly worded s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (and also see s.17A of the Federal Magistrates Court Act 1999 ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs84" from="[2008] FMCA 984">Section 17A was inserted into the Court's statute by the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 and commenced on 1 December 2005. It was designed to have general application and to strengthen the power of the Court to deal with unmeritorious proceedings by broadening the grounds on which the Court can summarily dispose of them: Explanatory Memorandum to Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 . The fact that the purpose of the section is to make obtaining summary dismissal easier than previously has been recognised: Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [27] ; Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [54] ; Balding v Ten Talents Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 145 ; Vivid Entertainment LLC v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 157.  Recently, the Full Court of the Federal Court has considered s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 , in Jefferson Ford Pty Limited v Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited [2008] FCAFC 60. Their Honours' decision was discussed by Edmonds J in Spiteri v Nine Network Australia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 905. As his Honour observed, in the Jefferson Ford case Finkelstein and Gordon JJ expressed views which differed from each other and from the views expressed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Limited v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1352 , while Rares J noted that the parties to the appeal had accepted that the test to be applied was the test which he had stated in Boston Commercial Services Pty Limited and, as they had not argued the point, concluded that it was neither necessary nor appropriate to examine the issue in that appeal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs85" from="[2008] FMCA 947">At [124] --- [132] Gordon J said: "[124] First, the express words of s 31A impose a different and less stringent test to that described in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) ; [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129-30. As was explained in the second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A of the Federal Court Act, the legislative purpose of s 31A was to strengthen "... the power of the court to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCAFC 176 at [41] and PZ Cussons (International) Ltd v Rosa Dora Imports Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1642 at [13] . [125] That such a provision should exist is not surprising. In modern litigation, cost and delay are two prominent features of the legal landscape: Gleeson CJ (1998) Commentary on Paper by Lord Browne-Wilkinson (Supreme Court of New South Wales Judges' Conference) http://www.hcourt.gov.au/speeches/cj/cj_cj2.htm (viewed 26 November 2007) (stating that "civil litigation is far too expensive" and "there should be an increased emphasis on summary disposal of proceedings which are amenable to such treatment"). ... [129] As in the cases cited, s 31A must be read as conferring a power while indicating the circumstances in which it is to be used, ie, when there is "no reasonable prospect of success". To construe the statute otherwise would give judges discretion to allow even hopeless cases to proceed, which could not have been within the contemplation of a legislature that intended to make summary judgment easier to obtain. Therefore, to the extent that previous decisions of the Federal Court may be understood as suggesting that s 31A confers a general discretion (eg Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ), such a construction of the statutory language is rejected. [130] A fifth principle is that where there is a real issue of fact relevant to a pleaded cause of action, it is unlikely that that part of the proceeding has no prospect of success: see Boston Commercial Services at [44]. So, for example, if the pleadings, affidavits, and other materials considered in connection with the summary judgment motion, reveal a factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether or not the claim succeeds, it cannot be said that the claim has "no reasonable prospect of success": see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] (stating that summary judgment should be made by reference to the pleadings, affidavits, and other evidence as appropriate under the circumstances) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 1416 at [32] . At [73] --- [74] his Honour said: "[73] The parties accepted both before the primary judge and before us that the test to be applied under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act was that which I stated in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 esp at 731 [45]. Because neither party challenged that test, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to examine it in this appeal for the reasons given in Roy Morgan Research Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (Vic) [2001] HCA 49 ; (2001) 207 CLR 72 at 82-83 [23] per Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ; In the Matter of an Application by the Chief Commissioner of Police (Vic) [2005] HCA 18 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 881 at 886 [29] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ. If the Court were to consider departing from that formulation of the test, the parties are entitled to be heard on the question. The Court's function is to decide the litigation on the issues fought by the parties. It is not entitled, without either party raising an issue, let alone addressing it, to embark after reserving judgment on a determination of an important question of statutory construction which is not an issue in the litigation. [74] Accordingly, if Jefferson Ford is able to establish that there was a real issue of fact or a real issue of law capable of being decided in its favour then, subject to the Court's discretion to determine the question of law, the matter ought to be allowed to go to trial in the ordinary way. "  A comprehensive review of the relevant authorities was undertaken by Driver FM in Vivid Entertainment LLC &amp; Ors v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FMCA 157. After reviewing relevant authorities including Vans, Inc v offprice.com.au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 ; Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia [2006] FCA 1352 ; Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v CAN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 ; Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 and Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 Driver FM at [30] preferred the approach of Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs86" from="[2008] FMCA 911">One such principle is that the moving party bears the onus of persuading the Court that the opponent has no reasonable prospect of success; The trial Court's decision to grant summary judgment is to be made as a question of law, not as the exercise of a discretion; Where there is a real issue of fact relevant to a pleaded cause of action, it is unlikely that that part of the proceeding has no prospect of success. A real issue of law does not necessarily preclude summary judgment; and In determining whether a real issue of fact exists such as to preclude summary judgment, the Court must draw all reasonable inferences --- but only reasonable inferences --- in favour of the non-moving party. ( Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000247601 Pty Ltd (in liquidation) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 at (30); Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 at (45). 
In relation to this final principle His Honour went on to say:
 
 "I emphasise "reasonable" because it is on this point that the lowering of the bar affected by s.31A becomes clear. By distinguishing between "hopeless" cases and those without reasonable prospects for success, the statute makes clear that the Court need not (indeed, must not) refuse summary judgment on the basis of a factual dispute said to arise only from a plausible, as opposed to a reasonable, inference.</sentence>

As was explained in the second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A of the Federal Court Act, the legislative purpose of s 31A was to strengthen " ... the power of the court to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006 ) [2006] FCA 1352 ; 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCAFC 176 at [41] and PZ Cussons (International) Limited v Rosa Dora Imports Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1642 at [13] . 125. That such a provision should exist is not surprising. Since Driver FM's judgment, the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia has considered the approach to s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act. In Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited [2008] FCAFC 60 the Full Court consisted of Finkelstein, Rares and Gordon JJ. Finkelstein J summarised the approach thus: 21 In Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 Rares J attempted to describe the requisite standard under s 31A. After reviewing many cases, most from different and not necessarily analogous areas, he came down to the view (expressed at 157) that if there was "a real issue of fact to be decided" or "possibly, where there is a real issue of law" to be resolved the matter should go to trial. This, with respect, does not seem to be very far removed from the old O 14 test. Rares J. took a different view: 73 The parties accepted both before the primary judge and before us that the test to be applied under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act was that which I stated in Boston Commercial Services Pty Limited v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 esp at 731 [45]. Because neither party challenged that test, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to examine it in this appeal for the reasons given in Roy Morgan Research Centre Pty Limited v Commissioner of State Revenue (Vic) [2001] HCA 49 ; (2001) 207 CLR 72 at 82-83 at [23] per Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ; In the Matter of an Application by the Chief Commissioner of Police (Vic) [2005] HCA 18 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 881 at 886 [29] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ. If the Court were to consider departing from that formulation of the test, the parties are entitled to be heard on the question. The Court's function is to decide the litigation on the issues fought by the parties. It is not entitled, without either party raising an issue, let alone addressing it, to embark after reserving judgment on a determination of an important question of statutory construction which is not an issue in the litigation.  As in the cases cited, s 31A must be read as conferring a power while indicating the circumstances in which it is to be used, ie, when there is "no reasonable prospect of success". To construe the statute otherwise would give judges discretion to allow even hopeless cases to proceed, which could not have been within the contemplation of a legislature that intended to make summary judgment easier to obtain. Therefore, to the extent that previous decisions of the Federal Court may be understood as suggesting that s 31A confers a general discretion (eg Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ), such a construction of the statutory language is rejected. 130. A fifth principle is that where there is a real issue of fact relevant to a pleaded cause of action, it is unlikely that that part of the proceeding has no prospect of success: see Boston Commercial Services at [44].</sentence>

Their Honours' decision was discussed by Edmonds J in Spiteri v Nine Network Australia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 905.

The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: 
 
 
 (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings;
 
 (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; 
 
 (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; 
 
 (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial;
 
 (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; 
 
 (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial; 
 
 
 
 (h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects; 
 
 (i) in determining if there are real issues of fact in issue so as to preclude summary judgment the courts must draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party.

The utility of bringing such a motion in the present circumstances is questionable when, inevitably, there was, in effect, full argument on the first motion as the means of considering the motion for dismissal. I will refer to the Walman Yawuru respondents, in respect to the dismissal motion, simply as the respondents.  30 It is for the applicant to establish the grounds to warrant an order for dismissal under s 31A: Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; 236 ALR 720. Nonetheless the respondents submit that two issues arise on the first motion which, if resolved against them, would justify an order for dismissal. I take this concession to mean that if the applicant satisfies me that the respondents have no reasonable prospects of successfully demonstrating that the two issues are serious issues to be tried then the first motion ought to be summarily dismissed. Both issues reflect the core submission of the respondents which is to the effect that the applicant has no authority to negotiate future acts, on behalf of the Yawuru Community which includes the Walman Yawuru clan, with the State. In this way the matters for judgment have been significantly confined.

In other words, if an historical analysis is to be undertaken, reference needs to be made not only to English cases applying O XIV, but also to the English cases applying Pt 24 of the CPR. 73 The parties accepted both before the primary judge and before us that the test to be applied under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act was that which I stated in Boston Commercial Services Pty Limited v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 esp at 731 [45]. Because neither party challenged that test, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to examine it in this appeal for the reasons given in Roy Morgan Research Centre Pty Limited v Commissioner of State Revenue (Vic) [2001] HCA 49 ; (2001) 207 CLR 72 at 82-83 at [23] per Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ; In the Matter of an Application by the Chief Commissioner of Police (Vic) [2005] HCA 18 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 881 at 886 [29] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ. If the Court were to consider departing from that formulation of the test, the parties are entitled to be heard on the question. The Court's function is to decide the litigation on the issues fought by the parties. It is not entitled, without either party raising an issue, let alone addressing it, to embark after reserving judgment on a determination of an important question of statutory construction which is not an issue in the litigation. 124 First, the express words of s 31A impose a different and less stringent test to that described in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129-30. As was explained in the second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A of the Federal Court Act , the legislative purpose of s 31A was to strengthen " ... the power of the court to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCAFC 176 at [41] and PZ Cussons (International) Limited v Rosa Dora Imports Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1642 at [13] . 21 In Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 Rares J attempted to describe the requisite standard under s 31A. After reviewing many cases, most from different and not necessarily analogous areas, he came down to the view (expressed at 157) that if there was "a real issue of fact to be decided" or "possibly, where there is a real issue of law" to be resolved the matter should go to trial. This, with respect, does not seem to be very far removed from the old O 14 test. So the standard must be found elsewhere. </sentence>

 [2008] SAEOT 6 

 

 
 THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING JUDGMENT: 

 
 This is a decision upon an interlocutory application by the first respondent (PB Taxi Co.) that the complainant's claim against it be dismissed "for failing to disclose a curse (sic) of Action against the First Respondent".  In other jurisdictions, for the success of an application to dismiss a claim against a defendant, the Court has to be satisfied that there is no reasonable basis for the claim: District Court Civil Rules R 232(2). It has been held that "it was not necessary for the Court to undertake a predictive assessment of the prospects of success of the plaintiff's claim, but to see whether the claim was reasonably arguable": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720. That judgment was in relation to the exercise of the Court's discretion under s 31A of the Federal Court Act 1976 whereby the Court had to be satisfied that the party who was in the situation of the complainant in the subject proceedings, had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceedings against the party who had applied for summary judgment. </sentence>

Pursuant to this change, the principles set out in General Steel (supra) are not given "canonical force" in summary dismissal proceedings ( Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 425 at 427). Rather, a proceeding may be dismissed where a party has "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding" (see for example Garrett v Macks [2006] FCA 601 , White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 , Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 , Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 , Vans, Inc. v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 , E. &amp; J.

<sentence id="cs103" from="[2008] FMCA 321">In considering whether the application should be dismissed summarily under r.13.10(a) I have borne in mind the caution to be exercised in relation to an application for summary dismissal and the principle that an order which prevents the party from pursuing a claim should only be made in a very clear case (see Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1948) 78 CLR 62 at [91] ). I consider that this is such a very clear case. I have also had regard to the difference between the earlier form in which r.13.10(a) appeared and the present test (see Boston Commercial Services Pty Limited v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 in which Rares J discussed the Federal Court equivalent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs104" from="[2008] FCA 377">37 The statutory claims remain to be considered. Counsel for the plaintiffs ultimately conceded that he could find no support for assignability of these causes of action. That is correct. That relieves me from deciding the point. I should say that the concession would follow, directly or indirectly, from a long line of authority in this Court that is against assignment of a claim for damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) commencing with Park v Allied Mortgages Corp Ltd [1993] FCA 286 ; (1993) ATPR (Digest) 46-105. Those cases were recently reviewed and followed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [50] ---[58] in relation to claims made pursuant to s 82 for breaches of s 52 and s 51AC of the Trade Practices Act .  32 There have been varied opinions as to whether that basis can be applied by Australian courts without the High Court qualifying Poulton 89 CLR 540. As it happens, most negative opinions have been expressed by judges of this Court, eg Allstate Life Insurance Company v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1994] FCA 814 ; National Mutual Property Services (Aust) Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd [1995] FCA 1628 ; (1995) 132 ALR 514 ; Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd (No 4) [2001] FCA 1106 ; (2001) 123 FCR 62 ; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Cridlands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1413 ; (2003) 134 FCR 474 ; and Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146. A number of those and other authorities are analysed by McDougall J, who took the wider view, in Rickard Constructions Pty Ltd v Rickard Hails Moretti Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1041 ; (2004) 220 ALR 267. </sentence>

 [30] ...The authorities relating to the proper construction and effect of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act were exhaustively reviewed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [31] ---[48]. His Honour stated the relevant principles at [45] and they may be summarised as follows:
 * In assessing whether there are reasonable prospects of success, the Court must be cautious not to do an injustice by summary dismissal. * There will be reasonable prospects of success if there is evidence which may be reasonably believed so as to enable the party against whom summary judgment is sought to succeed at the final hearing. * Evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects. * Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, the discretion under s 31A cannot be enlivened. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs106" from="[2008] FMCA 343">In considering whether the application should be dismissed summarily under r.13.10(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules I have borne in mind the caution to be exercised in relation to any application for summary dismissal and that as a matter of principle an order which prevents a party from pursuing a claim should only be made in a very clear case (see Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62). I have also borne in mind the scope of the test for summary dismissal now applicable under r.13.10(a) and s.17A of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 and the equivalent provision in s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 as discussed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Proprietary Limited v G E Capital Finance Australasia Proprietary Limited [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 and also in White Industries Australia Limited and Another v The Commissioner for Taxation and Another [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [45] --- [60]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs107" from="[2008] FCA 400">25 The test to be applied on an application under s 31A has been considered in a number of authorities. The test which I applied in Boston Commercial Services Pty Limited v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 at 731 [45] required the court to be very cautious not to do a party injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings where, in accordance with the principles in Hocking v Bell [1945] HCA 16 ; (1945) 71 CLR 430 at 441-442 per Latham CJ (approved in Hocking v Bell [1947] HCA 54 ; (1947) 75 CLR 125 at 130-131), contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or another so as to enable one side or the other to succeed.

4 Whether or not the applicant/cross-respondent was entitled to amend without leave need not be determined as the parties are agreed that the substance of the matter should be decided on the basis that the respondent/cross-claimant is to satisfy the Court that the test laid down by s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is met. There is a burgeoning number of authorities which have considered the relatively straightforward wording of s 31A. Many of the authorities are cited by Lindgren J in White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [58] ; see also Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] . Subsection (3) of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) makes it clear that the way in which the previous regime had developed should no longer govern the question. Beyond that I respectfully see little merit in this case in considering judicial paraphrases of ordinary English. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs110" from="[2008] FCA 59">27 Earlier, in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 , Rares J reviewed the authorities on section 31A to that time: see paragraph [26] to [48]. His Honour concluded that what is required of the Court in applying that section is not a predictive assessment of the prospects of success in the matter should it proceed to trial, but rather an assessment of the evidence and pleadings on the incomplete material available: see paragraph [26] and [38] to [39]. His Honour said that if, on that assessment, the evidence is ambivalent and there is a real issue of fact to be decided, or a real issue of law, the matter should be allowed to proceed to trial in accordance with the principles set out in Hocking v Bell [1947] HCA 54 ; (1947) 75 CLR 125: see paragraph [43]. He emphasised that the Court should be careful not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings. He added that the moving party bears the onus of enlivening the Court's " discretion to authorize a summary termination of the proceedings which s31A envisages" : see paragraph [45]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs111" from="[2008] FCA 55">10 In PZ Cussons (International) Limited v Rosa Dora Imports Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1642 at [14] Kenny J provides a summary of observations that have been made in relation to the power conferred by s 31A. I gratefully adopt her Honour's summary:
 
 ... the occasion for summary judgment must be clear before it will be granted: see Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 at [13] per Tamberlin J. Summary judgment is inappropriate where there is a real dispute about the relevant facts and evidence: see Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 489 at [10] per Besanko J and Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v G E Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [31] to [48] per Rares J; Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Limited [2006] FCA 1441 at [23] per Tracey J; and Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] per French J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs112" from="[2007] FMCA 2104">In Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors , Greenwood J was satisfied that there was no prospect of the applicant succeeding in the proceedings were they allowed to go to trial in the ordinary way and thus there was a high degree of certainty as to the ultimate outcome. That degree of certainty was informed not just by deficiencies in the pleading but by reason of the weight to be given to factors discussed elsewhere in the reasons for judgment. His Honour described his conclusions in the following terms: Perhaps the test in determining a reasonable prospect of successful prosecution of a proceeding is whether there is a demonstrated 'real (as opposed to fanciful) issue of fact to be decided' ( Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 , per Rares J [31] --- [48]). However, the 'real issue of fact' must be framed within a comprehensible cause of action (in respect of which the applicant has standing) so that findings of fact in favour of the applicant give rise to a recognised remedy. (at [64])  Section 17A was inserted into the Court's statute by the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 and commenced on 1 December 2005. It was designed to have general application and to strengthen the power of the Court to deal with unmeritorious proceedings by broadening the grounds on which the Court can summarily dispose of them: Explanatory Memorandum to Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 . The fact that the purpose of the section is to make obtaining summary dismissal easier than previously has been recognised: Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [27] ; Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [54] ; Balding v Ten Talents Pty Limited [2007] FMCA 145 ; Vivid Entertainment LLC v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Limited [2007] FMCA 157. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs113" from="[2007] FCAFC 176">4 Tamberlin J summarily dismissed the proceeding upon the motion of UNSW pursuant to s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the FCA Act) because his Honour was satisfied that Ms Paramasivam had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding. It was not contended by Ms Paramasivam that his Honour had misunderstood or misapplied the proper legal test applicable to such a motion: see e.g. Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; Duncan v Lipscombe Charles Care Service Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; (2006) 150 IR 471. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs114" from="[2007] FMCA 1788">Support can also be found for the statement of French J in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 , where his Honour disagreed with Heerey J's view in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 that "[s]ection 31A was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeouts". French J considered that s.31A "allows for "judgment" or nothing" at [21]; see also JT Nominees Pty Ltd v Macks [2007] SASC 151 at [81] per Bleby J. A detailed consideration of the operation of s.31A was undertaken by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 where his Honour reviewed several relevant authorities and stated at [44]-[45]:
 
 "In a case to which s.31A applies, where there is a real issue of fact to be decided in the sense identified in the above principle, and, possibly, where there is a real issue of law of a similar kind, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. And one must be mindful that in Hocking v Bell (1945) 71 CLR at 487, Dixon J said that in effect, every judge who had heard the matter (through four trials, two Full Court appeals and, to that point, the appeal to the High Court) would have formed the view that the plaintiff should have failed had they been able to decide the facts, yet the Privy Council restored the second jury verdict in her favour and so concluded the litigation. This raises a very real question, as to what reasonable prospects are for present purposes.</sentence>

I have borne in mind the caution to be exercised in relation to an application for summary dismissal and note that the respondent accepts as a matter of principle that an order which prevents a party from pursuing a claim should only be made in a very clear case (see Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91). I have also borne in mind the test applicable under Rule 13.10(a) of no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding (as to which see the discussion by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Limited v GE Capital Finance (Australia) Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1352 in relation to the assessment of reasonable prospects of success for the purposes of section 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs121" from="[2007] FCA 1216">68 Of course, there are other policy considerations that may impact upon whether the court should deny the duty of care alleged here, namely the impact of prolonged and multiple actions against auditors, the availability of other civil and criminal proceedings against auditors, and the public interest in ensuring there are auditors ready and willing to perform their duties at a reasonable cost. These matters were raised in Esanda 188 CLR 241 at 282 to 289 per McHugh J. They are matters which need to be considered, but none in my view are of sufficient weight in the context of my inquiry to conclude that the facts and elements relied upon by the respondents could not give rise to a duty of care as alleged. It is still not possible to identify precisely a line of demarcation between the cases of pure economic loss in which damages are recoverable and those in which they are not recoverable, but I am not satisfied, even adopting the test under s 31A of the Federal Court Act, that this is a case where damages may not be recoverable: see generally Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs122" from="[2007] FMCA 1360">The question of the precise meaning of s.31A of the FCA Act and s.17A of the FM Act and of any change they have made has already been the subject of numerous decisions in this Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. The most recent review of them of which I am aware is that of Driver FM on 19 March 2007 in Vivid Entertainment LLC v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 157 at [18] - [28]. The authorities to which his Honour referred are: Howard v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2006] FMCA 975 ; MG Distribution Pty Ltd v Khan [2006] FMCA 666 ; Cate v International Flavours and Fragrances (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 36 ; Vans Inc v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 ; Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 ; Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 ; Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227 ; Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; (2006) 150 IR 471 ; Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 1441 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 ; Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 ; Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299. Not one of these cases was a migration case. In other words, the task of exploring the meaning of s.31A has arisen in a wide range of the cases in the Federal Magistrates Court and this Court, with the striking exception of migration cases, no doubt for the reason that I mentioned earlier: the provision is of no practical importance in them.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs123" from="[2007] FCA 1308">11 Mr Walsh argued that in applying the test for entering judgment as he did under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) his Honour erred. He said that his Honour should have found that there would be reasonable prospects of Mr Walsh's claim succeeding if there were evidence which might reasonably be believed so as to enable him to succeed at the final hearing. This is a paraphrase made by Jacobson J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 at [30] of the ratio decidendi of my decision in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at 153-157 [31] - [45] . The principle which is involved in this respect is one that identifies whether there was evidence upon which a trial judge could reasonably find for a plaintiff (or defendant if it is the defendant who is resisting the summary decision). Unless that evidence is so negligible in character as to amount only to a scintilla, a judge should not direct a jury or himself or herself to find a verdict for the other side. Once evidence could have an ambivalent character, prior to final determination at a trial, then as a matter of law there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s 31A: Boston 70 IPR at 156-157 [43]. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs128" from="[2007] FCA 923">5 A proceeding need not be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospects of success. Section 31A of the Act has established a lower standard for summary judgments in this context than that imposed in other cases: Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 1441. However the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings: Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [45] . 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs129" from="[2007] FCA 875">14 Section 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) empowers the Court to give summary judgment against an applicant if it is satisfied that the applicant has "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding". This is a less onerous test than that previously stated and applied in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130, namely that the allegations are "so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed". Section 31A was designed to make it easier for an opposing party to strike out a claim or defence: see Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at 158; Duncan v Lipscombe Charles Care Service Inc [2006] FCA 458 at [6] . Of course it is essential that the Court must be careful not to do an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings, or denying an applicant an opportunity to ventilate their case. However, in the present case, the material placed before the Court is not sufficient to satisfy the threshold raised by s 31A(2) because it does not raise a reasonable argument to the effect that there has been a contravention of the Act . The version of the evidence for which the applicant contends merely indicates a reference to the applicant's colour of skin or ethnic origin as a way of identifying her for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 (NSW), a piece of legislation which applies equally to people of any ethnic origin. Merely to identify a person by reference to characteristics of clothing, ethnicity or skin for the purpose of the application and enforcement of a generally applicable law is not a contravention of the Act . </sentence>

Finally, in Hicks v Ruddock &amp; Ors [65] Tamberlin J said of s 31A: 
 
 Section 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act was introduced to impose a lower requirement to dismiss an action by way of summary judgment than that which was imposed in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner of Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. In that case, the requirement was expressed in terms of "manifestly groundless" or "obviously untenable". In a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading: see Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] . The underlying principle is that the need for a summary judgment must be clear before the court will intervene to prevent a plaintiff submitting a case for determination in the usual way. Once it appears that there is a real issue to be determined, whether it be of fact or law, and that the rights of the parties depend on it, the court should not terminate the action by way of summary judgment. As Barwick CJ said in General Steel 112 CLR at 129-130, great care must be exercised to be sure that under the guise of achieving expeditious finality a plaintiff is not improperly deprived of the opportunity to have his or her case tried by the appointed tribunal. The general principle that a person should not lightly be shut out from a hearing is cogent --- the onus on the party applying for summary judgment is heavy. [66] 
 
  In Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [59] Rares J reviewed a number of the relevant authorities, including the English cases. He summarised the relevant principles as follows: 
 
 I am of opinion that in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s 31A , the court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing the proceedings where, in accordance with the principles in Hocking v Bell [1947] HCA 54 ; (1947) 75 CLR 125 , contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed. As soon as the evidence may have such an ambivalent character prior to a final determination, I am of opinion that then, as a matter of law, at that point there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s 31A. Obviously, there will be cases in which, because of their nature, it is necessary to undergo detailed analysis. However, the assessment of whether there is a reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding must depend upon the evidence and pleading the subject of the application. [61]
