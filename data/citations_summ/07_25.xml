<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 350">The Act provides no guidance as to the meaning of the term "special circumstances" in that provision. In Beadle v Director-General of Social Security [1984] AATA 176 ; (1985) 7 ALD 670 , the Full Federal Court stated that it was not possible to lay down precise limits or precise rules for the meaning of the term. The Court indicated that this would depend upon the circumstances of each particular case but commented that, even though the term lacks precision, it was sufficiently understood "not to require judicial gloss" (at 674). There, the Court affirmed the decision of the Tribunal ( Beadle and Director-General of Social Security (1984) 6 ALD 1) where (at 3) the Tribunal had acknowledged that the term was "incapable of precise or exhaustive definition" and that, to be special, the circumstances "must have a particular quality of unusualness that permits them to be described as special".

Besanko J refers extensively to Ryde v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2005] FCA 866 , where Branson J held that the use of the term special circumstances in the legislation demonstrated an intention to proscribe waiver in ordinary cases .

 ...the authorities have emphasised time and again the importance of maintaining flexibility in determining what constitutes special circumstances. The danger is that the test will be overstated if the word 'exceptional' is emphasised. It was not the intention of parliament to confine the exercise of the discretion to an exceptional case. There is less risk of overstatement if the words 'unusual' or 'uncommon' are emphasised. Those words indicate, correctly in my view, the fact that there must be something that distinguishes the case from the ordinary or usual case.

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2010] AATA 593">The phrase "special circumstances" is not defined in the Act; however, it has been judicially considered on numerous occasions in connection with the above provision or similar provisions, including: Re Beadle and Director-General of Social Security (1984) 6 ALD 1 , where the Tribunal said, at 3: 
 
 The qualifying adjective looks to circumstances that are unusual, uncommon or exceptional. ... This is not to say that the circumstances must be unique but they must have a particular quality of unusualness that permits them to be described as special. 
 

 Groth v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1995] FCA 1708 ; (1995) 40 ALD 541 , where Kiefel J in the Federal Court said, at 545: 
 
 ... it is sufficient to observe that it would require something to distinguish [the] case from others, to take it out of the usual or ordinary case. 
 

 Angelakos v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 25 ; (2007) 100 ALD 9 , where Besanko J in the Federal Court stated, at 18: 
 
 There is less risk of overstatement if the words 'unusual' or 'uncommon' [as referred to in Beadle] are emphasised. Those words indicate, correctly in my view, the fact that there must be something that distinguishes the case from the ordinary or usual case.

Cases which demonstrate "special circumstances" must show something which is "unusual, uncommon or exceptional" (see Re Beadle and Director-General of Social Security (1984) 6 ALD 1 at 4). In Angelakos v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 25 , Besanko J considered the use of the word "exceptional" involved overstatement. He said there was less risk of overstatement if the words "unusual" or "uncommon" were emphasised. It is also expected that such "special circumstances" or "special reasons" cases would need to demonstrate that the enforcement of a debt would be "unjust, unreasonable or otherwise inappropriate" (see Re Ivovic and Director-General of Social Services [1981] AATA 57 at paragraph 49). </sentence>

While it is unfortunate that the applicant's circumstances have resulted in her suffering from either a lack of understanding or some personal attribute referred to by Dr Whittington which prevents her from providing accurate information to the social security system managed by Centrelink, that does not show that something unfair, unintended or unjust had occurred.

The Tribunal notes that, when she suffered her injuries in the motor vehicle accident in January 2006, she was in receipt of DSP at that time for her heart condition. Moreover, on her evidence, Ms Still's high blood pressure has occurred since November 2008 when her dispute arose with Centrelink. She said there had been a clear deterioration in her general health since the accident. However, there was no clear evidence from her in support of this contention. As was said by Besanko J in Angelakos v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 25 , an applicant's circumstances must be "unusual" or "uncommon".

 ...The reference to special circumstances "by reason of which" a person liable "should be released" requires, in our view, that there must exist in the circumstances of the case, a factor or factors which justify the making of an exception in whole or in part to the principle of liability which the Act otherwise establishes...Thus whilst keeping the dominant principle of [recovery of debt] in mind, [the decision maker] must nevertheless be prepared to respond to the special circumstances of any particular case by reason of which strict enforcement of the liability created by the section would be unjust, unreasonable or otherwise...

<sentence id="cs57" from="[2009] AATA 139">Mr Andrews' evidence was that he was not given advice by his solicitor about the preclusion period. That is supported by the Form, noted above, which reveals an attempt by the solicitor to obtain that information before the consent order was made but no information in response. Mr Hamilton conceded there was no Centrelink documentation which demonstrated that Mr Andrews had been made aware of the preclusion period prior to his consenting to the settlement. The solicitor's letter of request was dated some 18 months prior to the Court's consent order. Perhaps, the solicitor could have followed up with a further request but there is no evidence before me in relation to that. There have been cases where a legal adviser's failure to properly advise a person in Mr Andrews' position has given rise to an exercise of discretion under s 1184K(1) of the Act [5] . Generally, however, this will not be the case on the basis that it is a matter between client and solicitor [6] . Further, if the recipient of the lump sum is made aware of the preclusion period at the time of, or shortly after, the receipt of the settlement monies, the significance of an absence of earlier advice is lessened [7] .  That observation is equally applicable to s 1184K(1) of the Act.

The Act provides no guidance as to the meaning of the term "special circumstances" in that provision. In Beadle v Director-General of Social Security [1984] AATA 176 ; (1985) 7 ALD 670 , the Full Federal Court stated that it was not possible to lay down precise limits or precise rules for the meaning of the term. The Court indicated that this would depend upon the circumstances of each particular case but commented that, even though the term lacks precision, it was sufficiently understood "not to require judicial gloss" (at 674). There, the Court affirmed the decision of the Tribunal ( Re Beadle and Director-General of Social Security (1984) 6 ALD 1) where (at 3) the Tribunal had acknowledged that the term was "incapable of precise or exhaustive definition" and that, to be special, the circumstances "must have a particular quality of unusualness that permits them to be described as special".
