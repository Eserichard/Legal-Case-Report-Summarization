<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 232">I adopt, with respect, the description of "mosaic analysis" given by the Director-General of the Office of National Assessments accepted by Foster J in Watson v AWB Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 1047 ; (2009) 259 ALR 524 at [32] : 
 
 "As to this, the Director-General said: 
 
 
 
 
 "Mosaic analysis" is a well-established counter-intelligence tool. Mosaic analysis involves combining pieces of information to enable a "picture" to emerge from which inferences can be drawn by targets, or other persons of interest, about matters not otherwise known to them. Some of the pieces of information may appear to be disparate and/or benign; and specific (but important) items of information may only be known by the target(s) or other persons of interest (making it difficult to precisely assess the risk posed by mosaic analysis in any particular scenario). However, in my opinion there is a very high risk that, disclosure of parts of the subpoenaed documents [referring to the 62 reports] , in conjunction with other facts already known to relevant persons, would enable them to draw reliable inferences in relation to sources and methods of intelligence collection of Australia's intelligence partners. "

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 142">75 Several matters of principle are relevant to the assessment of the Commonwealth's claim to public interest immunity:
 
 
 (a) a claim for public interest immunity has no automatic operation; it always remains the function of the Court to determine upon that claim ( Sankey v Whitlam , at 58 per Stephen J);
 (b) those who urge privilege for classes of documents, regardless of particular contents, carry a heavy burden of proof ( Sankey v Whitlam , at 62 per Stephen J);
 (c) the character of the proceedings and the issues raised are relevant: where the proceedings are centrally concerned with the government's conduct or a decision it has made, claims for public interest immunity over documents relating to that conduct or decision are less likely to succeed ( Sankey v Whitlam , at 56 per Stephen J);
 (d) the Court may examine the documents for the purpose of determining claims for public interest immunity ( Sankey v Whitlam , at 47-8 per Gibbs ACJ), a step that may be appropriate where it is "on the cards" that the documents contain relevant information ( Attorney-General (NSW) v Chidgey [2008] NSWCCA 65 ; (2008) 182 A Crim R 536 at [58] - [80]; Watson v AWB Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 1047 at [58] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 41">At [39]---[44] in Watson v AWB Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 1047 ; 259 ALR 524 I described the forensic purpose stated by AWB as being served by the production of documents of the kind then under consideration. It is not necessary for me to set out in full what I said in those paragraphs. It is sufficient for present purposes for me to note that AWB wishes to contend that DFAT had knowledge of the nature and extent of the payments made by AWB which the applicants assert were concealed. AWB relied upon the stated forensic purpose which I described at [39]---[44] in Watson v AWB Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 1047 ; 259 ALR 524 as supporting its claim for disclosure of the two documents which are under consideration in the present application.  At [51] in Watson v AWB Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 1047 ; 259 ALR 524 , I said: 
 
 Where an objection to the production of documents in answer to a subpoena is based upon a claim of public interest immunity, the usual practice---established many years ago---has been for the grounds of the claim to be set out and explained in an affidavit made by either the Minister who is the political head of the particular department concerned or the Secretary of that department ( Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 43). The weight to be afforded to that affidavit is governed to some degree by the extent of the knowledge which the deponent possesses concerning the documents which are the subject of the claim ( Sankey v Whitlam 142 CLR at 44). The knowledge of those documents which must be considered comprises not only knowledge of the contents of the documents but also knowledge of the circumstances in which they came into existence. When the claim is based partly or wholly on national security grounds, very considerable weight must be given to the views of the responsible Minister or the permanent head. In the present case, because we live in dangerous times and matters of national security are at the forefront of the ONA's responsibilities, very considerable weight must be given to the views of the Director-General expressed, as they were, on his oath ( Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 435). 
 

  In Watson and Anor v AWB Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 1047 ; (2009) 259 ALR 524 at [1] , I described the core claims made in the present proceeding as follows: 
 
 The present action is a class action brought by and on behalf of certain shareholders in the respondent (AWB). Those shareholders allege (amongst other things) that AWB contravened the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and other Commonwealth legislation by concealing from the Australian stock market and from relevant authorities the fact that it had paid inland transportation fees and other payments in respect of wheat shipments to Iraq which were inflated and which exceeded the real costs to AWB of transporting its wheat in Iraq in order to make funds available to entities and persons associated with the Government of Iraq in breach of UN sanctions which were then in force. 
 

  At [39]---[44] in Watson v AWB Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 1047 ; 259 ALR 524 I described the forensic purpose stated by AWB as being served by the production of documents of the kind then under consideration. It is not necessary for me to set out in full what I said in those paragraphs. It is sufficient for present purposes for me to note that AWB wishes to contend that DFAT had knowledge of the nature and extent of the payments made by AWB which the applicants assert were concealed. AWB relied upon the stated forensic purpose which I described at [39]---[44] in Watson v AWB Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 1047 ; 259 ALR 524 as supporting its claim for disclosure of the two documents which are under consideration in the present application.  The appropriate course, nonetheless, is for me to undertake the balancing exercise of which I spoke at [54] and [55] in Watson v AWB Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 1047 ; 259 ALR 524 . The competition is between the public interest in withholding production in order to avoid harm to the nation or the Public Service, on the one hand, and the public interest in requiring production in aid of the administration of justice, on the other hand. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCAFC 183">56 In Watson v AWB Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 1047 ; (2009) 259 ALR 524 at [32] Foster J adopted the Director-General of Security's description of "mosaic analysis":
 Mosaic analysis involves combining pieces of information to enable a 'picture' to emerge from which inferences can be drawn by targets, or other persons of interest, about matters not otherwise known to them. Some of the pieces of information may appear to be disparate and/or benign; and specific (but important) items of information may only be known by the target(s) or other persons of interest (making it difficult to precisely assess the risk posed by mosaic analysis in any particular scenario). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1175">The additional masking leaves very little of the text of the reports open for inspection. They also submit that access should be restricted to a small number of persons and that those persons should be required to give appropriate undertakings to the Court. At [49]---[67] of AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 , I explained my reasons for making the orders which I did on 17 September 2009. At [66] of AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 I reserved for further consideration the question of whether the ONA's claim that the documents produced in response to the orders which I made on 17 September 2009 should nonetheless be protected from disclosure on public interest immunity grounds. I have inspected all of the documents produced to me. They also submit that access should be restricted to a small number of persons and that those persons should be required to give appropriate undertakings to the Court. At [49]---[67] of AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 , I explained my reasons for making the orders which I did on 17 September 2009. At [66] of AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 I reserved for further consideration the question of whether the ONA's claim that the documents produced in response to the orders which I made on 17 September 2009 should nonetheless be protected from disclosure on public interest immunity grounds. I have inspected all of the documents produced to me. I have also considered the proposals advanced by the ONA and the Commonwealth as to the further masking which they submit is required should access be granted. At [39]---[44] in AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 , I discussed the forensic purpose to which AWB asserted that it would put the documents were they made available to it. I will not repeat what I said in AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 concerning that matter. However, it is the forensic purpose to which I have made reference in those paragraphs which I am weighing in the balance when considering the exigencies of the administration of justice in the present case. In essence, Counsel for AWB submitted that the 15 reports would constitute a body of evidence which might establish or which might tend to establish that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ( DFAT ) knew of the payments which AWB stands accused of concealing from it. In particular, it was submitted that, because the Cole Distillation was not admissible in evidence, AWB needed access to the documents from which that Distillation was derived in order to be able to tender those documents at the trial in its own case as business records.  Consistent with what I said at [64] of AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 , the mosaic analysis argument is the only argument which continues to find favour with me for resisting AWB's application for access to the 15 reports. It is extremely difficult for a Judge to second guess clear evidence to the effect that any disclosure of the contents of the 15 reports might lead to that sort of analysis being undertaken by persons who represent a threat to Australia's national interest. In AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 , I said that I did not accept that this argument carried much weight at the time I delivered those Reasons. That is why I ordered that the 15 reports be produced to the Court.  At [39]---[44] in AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 , I discussed the forensic purpose to which AWB asserted that it would put the documents were they made available to it. I will not repeat what I said in AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 concerning that matter.

I have inspected all of the documents produced to me. I have also considered the proposals advanced by the ONA and the Commonwealth as to the further masking which they submit is required should access be granted. As I am now considering what should be done at the second stage of the process, I am required to undertake the balancing exercise to which I referred at [54]---[62] of AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047. That exercise involves weighing up the requirements of the due administration of justice, having regard to the circumstances of the present case, against the public interest in protecting the documents from disclosure. That public interest in the present circumstances involves the protection of the national interest and matters of national security.  Consistent with what I said at [64] of AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 , the mosaic analysis argument is the only argument which continues to find favour with me for resisting AWB's application for access to the 15 reports. It is extremely difficult for a Judge to second guess clear evidence to the effect that any disclosure of the contents of the 15 reports might lead to that sort of analysis being undertaken by persons who represent a threat to Australia's national interest. In AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 , I said that I did not accept that this argument carried much weight at the time I delivered those Reasons. That is why I ordered that the 15 reports be produced to the Court.  In addition, there is a very real and substantial question as to whether any of the contents of the 15 reports would be held to be sufficiently relevant to justify the tender of those reports. As I pointed out in AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 , AWB is not mentioned in any of the reports, only one document refers to any Australian company or entity and none of the documents specifies the wheat trade, with one exception. That exception was a November 2003 report which suggested that most large companies had refused to pay Iraqi imposed surcharges, citing, as an example, wheat imports from Australia. </sentence>
