 [1] The first plaintiff is the registered patentee of standard patent no.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 222">The final ground of revocation involves a contention that SBriggs obtained the patent by fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation ([11], s 138(3)(d) of the Patents Act ) and that the amendment to the patent ([12], [17], [18], [56] and [57]; s 138(3)(e) of the Patents Act ) was also obtained by fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation. The question is whether the conduct of SBriggs said to bear the character required by the section, materially contributed to the Commissioner's decision to grant the patent or amend the claims. It is sufficient if the conduct is a material inducing factor which led to either of those outcomes ( Prestige Group (Australia) Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc. (1990) 26 FCR 197 ; Pfizer (supra); JMVB Enterprises Pty Ltd v Camoflag Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 68). Sections 138(3)(d) and 138 (3)(e) do not require proof of a deliberate intention on the part of the applicant for the patent (or amendment) to deceive the Commissioner ( Pfizer ). If the representation is based upon a belief, it is relevant to consider whether the belief is false or not held reasonably ( NSI Dental Pty Ltd v University of Melbourne [2006] FCA 1216 ; (2006) 69 IPR 542). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] APO 20">In this regard, the applicant referred to the Federal Court decision in NSI Dental Pty Ltd v University of Melbourne [2006] FCA 1216 ; (2006) 69 IPR 542 at paragraph 125. This decision relied on the definition of "patent application" in section 29(2) [13] to construe the same term in section 24 to include an Australian provisional application. The applicant then reasoned that this definition automatically extended to foreign provisional applications because of Australia's obligations under TRIPS and the USFTA agreements to accord equal privileges to foreign based applicants.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCAFC 34">151 The transcript of the argument in the appeal is illuminating. When Mr Hess was asked why compound six had to "stand out", his answer was that otherwise it "does not become relevant". When challenged regarding that proposition, given that the requirement of relevance in s 7(3) seemingly involved a relatively low threshold, he referred to a passage in the judgment of Tamberlin J in NSI Dental Pty Ltd v University of Melbourne [2006] FCA 1216 ; (2006) 69 IPR 542 at [201] where his Honour stated: 
 
 " I am not persuaded on the evidence of the skilled addressee(s) that it could have been reasonably expected that these three articles would have been ascertained by persons skilled in the relevant art before 12 March 1997. Nor am I satisfied that a skilled addressee would have been expected to treat them as relevantly a single source or that any particular attention would have been paid to them. "</sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCAFC 5">23 His Honour heard the trial over 10 days. The primary judge, in substance, upheld all claims of infringement against, relevantly, the Probiotec parties. He found that the complex patent and the phosphopeptide patent were valid ( NSI Dental Pty Ltd v The University of Melbourne [2006] FCA 1216). He granted injunctions restraining all the cross-respondents (the NSI parties and the Probiotec parties) from infringing both patents or being accessorially involved in their infringement.</sentence>

" 194 The reference to 'reasonably expected' in s 7(2), in my view, means that it is not simply a question of a person's capacity to use search tools and methods in order to locate information but rather whether, in the opinion of the Court, there is on the evidence a reasonable degree of expectation that the skilled person would have ascertained the information.</sentence>

 'At the outset, it is necessary to describe the attributes of the skilled addressee and the relevant patent area. The skilled addressee is a legal construct and is assumed to be a person, or team, who is "not 'particularly imaginative or inventive'": Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly and Co [2005] FCAFC 224 at [288] per French and Lindgren JJ.
