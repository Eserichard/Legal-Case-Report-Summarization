<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 328">In granting the respondent's application, the Senior Member referred, at [109], to two authorities in this Court, Duncan v Fayle [2004] FCA 723 ; (2004) 138 FCR 510 and Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 279 ; (2006) 42 AAR 503. In Duncan , French J said, at 517 (in a passage quoted with apparent approval by Spender J in Theo, at 508); 
 'A decision dismissing an application as frivolous or vexatious under s 42B(1) is a decision which finally disposes of the application. It has necessarily involved a consideration of the merits in the sense that it requires a finding that the application cannot succeed. ' 

 
His Honour then went on to explain the views expressed by the three judges of this Court sitting as Presidential Members of the Tribunal in Re Williams and Australian Electoral Commission [1995] AATA 160 ; (1995) 38 ALD 366 , that the application of s 42B attracts the same general criteria for dismissal as apply to proceedings in this Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] AATA 580">
 
 The court can only intervene by judicial review to direct the commissioners to abstain from performing their statutory duties or from exercising their statutory powers if the court is satisfied that the 'unfairness' of which the applicant complains renders the insistence by the commissioners on performing their duties or exercising their powers an abuse of power by the commissioners. " [657] 
 
 
552. We cannot let these feelings deter us from our statutory responsibility as stated by Spender J in Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [658] that:
 
 "... the proceedings in the Tribunal fall to be determined on the material before it, and not on the basis of whether that material was the same as, or different to, the material before other decision-makers in other applications. Generally there cannot be an estoppel against the terms of a statute. "

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] HCASL 21">The applicant's notice of appeal in this Court was lodged out of time. He would therefore require an extension of time to bring his application. In view of the affidavit filed, explaining how the time default arose, we would not reject the application on that basis. The applicant's notice of appeal is embarrassing in the technical sense, in that it does not purport to identify admissible grounds of appeal other than to assert that Kiefel J should have disqualified herself because of previous involvement in cases concerning the applicant. No arguable basis for a grant of special leave is shown on this footing, nor on the ground that states that the Full Court should have followed an earlier decision of Spender J. See Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 279 ; (2006) 42 AAR 503. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCAFC 72">34 In Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 279 ; (2006) 42 AAR 503 Spender J held that the Tribunal's power under s 42B(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) cannot be exercised unless the Tribunal considers the merits of the application on the basis of the material before it and finds that the application is futile because it cannot succeed. Section 42B(1) empowers the Tribunal to dismiss an application if satisfied it is frivolous or vexatious. Spender J found that the Tribunal had failed to have regard to certain of the material before it. That case has no resemblance to the present case, and does not assist the appellant.
  2 On 12 July 2004 the appellant applied for the age pension. The application was rejected and the rejection was confirmed on review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT). The Tribunal dismissed the appellant's application for review of the SSAT's decision. The appellant's appeal to the Federal Court was upheld by Spender J, who set aside the orders made by the Tribunal and remitted the matter to it for reconsideration: Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 279 ; (2006) 42 AAR 503. On 1 December 2006 the Tribunal, constituted by Greenwood J, confirmed the decision under review. The appeal is from that decision.
  30 These principles have been applied in two of the appellant's own cases: Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 279 ; (2006) 42 AAR 503 at [39] per Spender J and Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2005] FCA 880 at [52] per French J. We agree with French J's observation that "there was no estoppel which would overcome the statutory powers which supported the cancellation of his pension and the limitation on eligibility under s 63(4) which prevented such a payment being made".
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] AATA 1242">In the circumstances I am satisfied that this application is frivolous or vexatious. It should therefore be dismissed. For the reasons given above I am satisfied that having reviewed the merits of the application I am satisfied that it cannot succeed (refer Duncan v Fayle [2004] FCA 723 ; Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 279). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] AATA 1210">Centrelink wrote to Mr Theo on 4 April 2006 seeking additional information about his claim. The letter asked him to complete a number of forms including an S module (which asks about the circumstances of an applicant's separation from his or her spouse or partner) and a PT module (which asks about an applicant's involvement in a private trust). As an alternative to completing the PT module, Mr Theo was advised he could produce an amended trust deed that showed he had relinquished any role in the trust. Mr Theo returned the letter with notes on the bottom which claimed Centrelink had treated his application with contempt. He wrote "N/A" on the cover of the PT form and did not answer any questions. He attached a copy of the Federal Court's decision in Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 279 and advised the "information you requested exists in my application and your files. "  The Tribunal was provided with the documents required under s 37 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . The "T" documents include the original claim form filed with Centrelink and the PT module form that Centerlink uses to collect information about an applicant's involvement with a trust. The respondent also tendered an affidavit sworn by Mr Barry Cosgrove, a solicitor in the employ of the Australian Government Solicitor. Mr Theo filed copies of his correspondence with the respondent and the Tribunal in which he says he set out most of his arguments. He also tendered a copy of a decision of Spender J in Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 279. He provided extracts of several pieces of legislation and a copy of an article by Professor Leslie Zines about the common law in Australia. He also tendered a copy of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Spender J pointed out in Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 279 that the Tribunal must critically evaluate Centrelink's requests for information. The Tribunal must be satisfied the requested information was in fact required by Centrelink in order for it to do its job of assessing whether the applicant was eligible to receive benefits. In that case, Centrelink sought information about the identity of the individual who controlled the trust, and documentation establishing that Mr Theo was no longer trustee. His Honour pointed out (at [14]): 
 ...while it is clear that in order to decide whether a person has an entitlement to Age Pension, an assessment of income and assets has to be made, it is by no means clear (and seems to me to reflect an imperfect understanding of the difference between any entitlement to income and assets of a trust, and the status of controller of trust property), that, in order to be able to assess income and assets, Centrelink 'require[s] proper original evidence of the legal date of transfer of control of the trust and of who is now in control of the trust, a completed "Private Trust" form and full financial documents for the trust dealing income and assets held'. 
 
  In any event, additional facts have come to light since the decision in Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 279 suggesting the respondent was right to seek clarification as to Mr Theo's involvement with the trust. The affidavit of Mr Cosgrove refers to a series of land transactions after the date on which Mr Theo said he ceased playing a formal role in relation to the trust. Mr Theo is identified in the title documents in each case as the transferee of real property, albeit as trustee. He admits he signed the relevant documents. He said he did so at the request of someone from the Department of Natural Resources and Water, which maintains the register. He did not identify who made the request, nor was I able to discern from his oral evidence why such a request would be made. Mr Theo said he was merely playing an administrative role when he signed the documents. He expressly declined to explain what he meant by that expression, and became abusive when pressed. </sentence>

 REASONS FOR DECISION 
 Introduction 
 
 Mr Solon Theo is an applicant for an 'age pension'. He was born on 3 July 1933 in Egypt, is a resident of Australia and is an Australian citizen.  On 22 March 2006, Spender J dismissed Mr Theo's application in relation to the disability support pension ( Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 279 at [21] , [22]). However, his Honour concluded that the Tribunal was required in conducting a de novo merits review of the age pension decision, to have regard to all material logically probative of the existence of facts material to the decision [33] and in failing to have regard to documents before the Tribunal including an earlier affidavit of Mr Theo sworn 26 March 2003 and an affidavit sworn 27 June 2002, addressing Mr Theo's standing or relationship (if any) in connection with the 'Solon Theo Family Trust', an error of law occurred. His Honour also determined that consistent with Duncan v Fayle [2004] FCA 723 [22], per French J, an application pursuant to s 42B of the A A T Act necessarily requires a consideration of the merits (based on all the material before the Tribunal logically probative of the relevant facts) and a finding that the application cannot succeed, if the application is to be declared frivolous and vexatious. His Honour concluded that the material before the Tribunal did not satisfy that test ([36] --- [45]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2006] AATA 710">He pointed to the decision-making regime in which APRA operated. 219. At the outset, we note the general position in relation to decisions affecting persons other than the applicants is that stated by Spender J in Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services : [362] 
 
 "... the proceedings in the Tribunal fall to be determined on the material before it, and not on the basis of whether that material was the same as, or different to, the material before other decision-makers in other applications. Generally there cannot be an estoppel against the terms of a statute. "
