<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 84">1 This is a taxation appeal from a single judge of the Court in which her Honour allowed the respondent's appeal against the appellant's objection decision: see Secretary to the Department of Transport (Victoria) v Commissioner of Taxation (2009) 261 ALR 39 ; [2009] FCA 1209. In his objection decision, the appellant ('the Commissioner') determined that the respondent ('the DOT') was not entitled to input tax credits under s 11 -20 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 ('the GST Act') for the tax periods 1 October 2006 to 30 April 2007 ('the relevant periods') in respect of payments made by the DOT under the DOT's Multi Purpose Taxi Program ('the MPTP'). The primary judge held that the Commissioner incorrectly rejected the DOT's claim that the DOT made creditable acquisitions under Division 11 of the GST Act and, in consequence, the Commissioner wrongly rejected the DOT's claim for input tax credits. On this appeal, the Commissioner challenges this decision.</sentence>
