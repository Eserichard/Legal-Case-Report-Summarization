<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 8">We accept that the Tribunal must make its own assessment of the evidence and other information with a view to making its own findings of fact directed to the fundamental question for determination --- whether the decision of the trustee was fair and reasonable. The Tribunal may, of course, accept the findings made by the trustee if it agrees with them, but the Tribunal's function is not discharged merely by forming a view that the trustee's factual findings were fair and reasonable. Rather, the Tribunal must ascertain the facts for itself upon the material before it and satisfy itself by reference to these facts whether the trustee's decision was fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Moore J expressed the same idea in Marks v CSS Board of Trustees [2005] FCA 797 at [23] , saying: 
 
 [Section] 37(6) of the Complaints Act does not authorise ... the Tribunal simply reviewing all factual issues and indicating that findings by the prior decision maker were fair and reasonable. That subsection is intended to operate on the ultimate decision made by the prior decision maker, namely the decision under review. What the Tribunal must do is form a view about necessary facts, determine what the facts are and then by reference to those ascertained facts determine whether the decision of the prior decision maker was fair and reasonable in the circumstances. The facts ascertained by the Tribunal constitute "the circumstances" by reference to which the Tribunal makes that evaluation.
