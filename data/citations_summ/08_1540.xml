The applicable principles were summarised by Cowdroy J in Budd v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1540 , by reference to an earlier decision of Federal Magistrate McInnis, as follows: 
 
 "18. ... In Phillips v Australian Girls' Choir Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [2001] FMCA 109 Federal Magistrate McInnis considered the nature of the discretion contained in s 44(2A)(a) of the AAT Act, and said at [10]:

<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] AATA 967">This approach was adopted by McInnis FM in Phillips v Australian Girls' Choir and Another [2001] FMCA 109 where the Federal Magistrate said it is clear that this principle referred to by Wilcox J in the Hunter Valley case needs to be modified so that it is no longer regarded as law that an applicant has to show an acceptable explanation for delay, or that it is fair and equitable in the circumstances to extend time, as a pre-condition to the exercise of discretion in favour of the applicant. The Federal Magistrate's approach was endorsed by Cowdroy J in Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 624 ; (2006) 151 FCR 524 and more recently in Budd v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1540. According to McInnis FM, the principles which should be regarded when determining whether to grant an extension of time are as follows: There is no onus of proof upon an applicant for extension of time though an application has to be made. Special circumstances need not be shown, but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied it is proper to do so.</sentence>
