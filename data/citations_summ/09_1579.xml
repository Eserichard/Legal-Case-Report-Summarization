<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 301">As Finkelstein J recognised, in a number of recent comparable applications by the ACCC, judges of the Federal Court have granted declaratory relief on the basis of a statement of agreed facts. See ACCC v Jetplace Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 759 at [52] ; ACCC v Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1579 ; ACCC v Wilson Parking 1992 Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1580 ; Minister for the Environment, Heritage &amp; the Arts v PGP Developments Pty Limited [2010] FCA 58 ; (2010) 183 FCR 10  In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) v Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1579 (" Cosic "), Barker J stated at [49]-[51]: 
 
 
 I am satisfied that on the material before the court and in light of the statement of agreed facts to which the parties to this proceeding have subscribed and the court has received, it is appropriate for the court to make the declarations sought without requiring the taking of evidence in a more formal way. 
 
 

 
 
 
 In taking this practical approach it seems to me relevant to note that the application is that of the ACCC, a public agency charged with the administration of these relevant consumer provisions of the Act, and that the agreement between the parties of the facts that are relevant to the outcome of the case and the orders that should be made follow pleadings filed and served by the parties. It is appropriate in such circumstances for the court to treat the information put forward if not strictly "evidence" then as sufficiently reliable for the court to act upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1486">9. If the notice under subsection 16(1) is not valid, then the order of [the] Magistrate ... on 3 April 2009 that the Applicant be committed to prison, which cannot be made without such a notice being received is also without a sufficient jurisdictional basis: see subsection 19(1)(b) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth). The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to section 23 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) to make an order that the Applicant be released from custody as an incident of its jurisdiction to grant prerogative relief: Zentai v Honourable Brendan O'Connor [2009] FCA 1579 at [22] . 
 
 ... 
 

 The Court, in determining the merits of the interlocutory application to be released, should note that the refusal of bail by his Honour Justice Barker on 6 April 2009 was a decision based on the paucity of evidence then available before, rather than an assessment of the full merits of the matter. The Court should note the submissions made in the course of the hearing that the Applicant has previously been on bail for 5 years without showing any signs that he was a flight risk, and the reference to the finding of Magistrate Brown in 2004 in that regard ..., which was noted by Justice French when determining the appeal against Magistrate Brown's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 759">Since then, by way of illustration this Court has made declarations supported by a signed statement of agreed facts in the following decisions: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1579 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Wilson Parking 1992 Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1580 ; Minister for the Environment, Heritage &amp; the Arts v PGP Developments Pty Limited [2010] FCA 58.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 760">Since then, by way of illustration, this Court, in the following decisions, has made declarations supported by a signed statement of agreed facts: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1579 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Wilson Parking 1992 Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1580 ; Minister for the Environment, Heritage &amp; the Arts v PGP Developments Pty Limited [2010] FCA 48. Declarations
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 58">The approach adopted in New South Wales was followed by Barker J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1579 where his Honour said at [51]: 
 
 I note that in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd , Finkelstein J of this Court, at [16], noted a number of New South Wales Supreme Court decisions that have followed the course that I now propose to adopt, but different from what his Honour there proposed. In those other decisions the Court had acknowledged the general rule that a declaration on a matter relating to a public or analogous right should not be made by consent. However, those cases considered that a declaration could be made if the Court was satisfied by evidence that it ought to be made, the "evidence" to which regard may be had, including "facts" admitted to be true about which there is no direct evidence --- facts, for example, contained in a statement of agreed facts. I am persuaded that the approach adopted in such cases as Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2004] NSWSC 836 ; (2004) 50 ACSR 500 , referred to by Finkelstein J at [16], provide useful guidance in this regard. 
 

His Honour took the same approach in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Wilson Parking 1992 Pty Ltd (ACN 052 475 911) [2009] FCA 1580. Section 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1580">I am satisfied that the declarations should be made. To the extent that it is suggested that the Court should not make declarations in such circumstances, where public rights are an issue, unless there is "evidence" before the Court, I am satisfied that it is appropriate for the Court to make the declarations sought on the basis of the information currently before the Court, including the statement of agreed facts signed by the parties. See generally my observations in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1579 at [49] --- [51]. </sentence>
