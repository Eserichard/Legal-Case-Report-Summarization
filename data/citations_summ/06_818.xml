<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 301">[26] 
 
In Weyers v Commissioner of Taxation [27] Dowsett J said in the context of a taxing provision dependent upon the conduct "expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances":
 
It is tempting to exonerate Mrs Weyers from these criticisms on the grounds of her assumed lack of business experience and reliance on her husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 649">In Weyers &amp; Anor v Commissioner of Taxation , [117] Dowsett J referred to the conduct " expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances " but there is no express suggestion in his judgment that regard may be had to matters such as the knowledge, education, experience and skill of the taxpayer. ... " [115] 
 
 
56. [114] He first repeated its effect:
 
" ... For the purposes of s 226G it is necessary to identify conduct falling short of that expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances. " [118] 
 
 
60. [119] The focus is clearly upon the reasonable person in the circumstances of the taxpayer but not upon a reasonable person who has the personal attributes of the taxpayer and finds him or herself in the taxpayer's particular circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] ATOMTR MT2008/1">However, if an entity ignores an unfavourable private ruling on a matter where the law is clearly established, that may constitute intentional disregard. 116. Weyers v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 818 ; 2006 ATC 4523 ; (2006) 63 ATR 268 illustrates the proposition that intentional disregard of the law can be inferred from the facts and surrounding circumstances. In that case a tax agent prepared tax returns for his clients that failed to return trust distributions as income on the basis that the amounts were not trust distributions but payments by way of loan. Dowsett J concluded at paragraph 168 that on the evidence the tax agent must have known that the amounts were trust income derived and not payments by way of loan. However, if an entity ignores an unfavourable private ruling on a matter where the law is clearly established, that may constitute intentional disregard. 116. Weyers v.

Dowsett J concluded at paragraph 168 that on the evidence the tax agent must have known that the amounts were trust income derived and not payments by way of loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 415">59. The Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the TA Amendment Act contained no suggestion that the taxpayer's individual circumstances are relevant. In Weyers &amp; Anor v Commissioner of Taxation , [87] Dowsett J referred to the conduct " expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances " but there is no express suggestion in his judgment that regard may be had to matters such as the knowledge, education, experience and skill of the taxpayer. Indeed, his Honour expressly referred to the " reasonable lay person " and, in its context, I understand that to be a reference to a reasonable person without the benefit of relevant expertise in taxation law. He said that the reasonable lay person would not have been satisfied by a particular explanation and would have asked further questions as to why his or her money was not being recorded as that but as a loan and, if it was a loan, why it was not to be repaid. 60. Any suggestion that may be implied from this passage is dispelled by his following reference to the passage I have already set out i.e. " ... For the purposes of s 226G it is necessary to identify conduct falling short of that expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances. ... ". [89] The focus is clearly upon the reasonable person in the circumstances of the taxpayer but not upon a reasonable person who has the personal attributes of the taxpayer and finds him or herself in the taxpayer's particular circumstances. That is a different test and not that which is set out in item 3 of s 284-90 of the TA Act. It is a subjective test whereas it seems to me that item 3 of s 284-90 is setting an objective test. However it would be anachronistic to assume that a female taxpayer's duty in connection with the revenue is somehow of a lower order than that of a male taxpayer. Indeed, if her experience is less, her duty to inquire may be greater. " [88]  55. Until its amendment by A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Act (No 2) 2000 (TA Amendment Act), penalties were provided for in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITA Act 1936). The TA Amendment Act inserted Division 284 in the TA Act. [82] Section 226G of the ITA Act 1936 was not affected by the amendment and was in substantively the same terms as newly enacted item 3 of 
s 284-90(1) of the TA Act. [83] Section 226G was considered by Dowsett J in Weyers &amp; Anor v Federal Commissioner of Taxation . [84] He first repeated its effect:
 
" ... For the purposes of s 226G it is necessary to identify conduct falling short of that expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances. ... " [85]  55.

This publication is a draft for public comment. It represents the Commissioner's preliminary view about the way in which a relevant taxation provision applies, or would apply to entities generally or to a class of entities in relation to a particular scheme or a class of schemes. However, if an entity ignores an unfavourable private ruling on a matter where the law is clearly established, that may constitute intentional disregard. 114. Weyers & Anor v.
