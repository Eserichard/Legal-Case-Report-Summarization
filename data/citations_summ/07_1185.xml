<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1200">The summary judgment principles have been applied in the context of native title determinations on a number of occasions. In Moran v Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [1999] FCA 1637 Wilcox J dismissed proceedings for lack of authorisation (at [44]-[48]). In Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178 the Full Court (North, Dowsett and Lander JJ) (at [48]-[49] also on an authorisation basis); Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77 (at 88-89, at [50]-[51] where Stone J examined the Senate debate on the topic of summary judgment); Walker on behalf of The Noonukul of Minjerrabah v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 967 (at [17]-[18] again for lack of authorisation); and Van Hemmen on behalf of The Kabi Kabi People #3 v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 1185 (at [8] and, again, for lack of authorisation). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] WASCA 179">42 These cases, and others (see, for example, New Cap Reinsurance Corp Ltd v General Cologne Re Australia Ltd (No 2) [2005] NSWSC 276 [29] (Young CJ in eq); Re HIH Casualty &amp; General Insurance Ltd [2006] NSWSC 6 ; and Van Hemmen on behalf of The Kabi Kabi People No 3 v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 1185 [39] - [42] (Collier J)), seem to me to establish that, in the context of a wide conferral of jurisdiction such as that given by s 37 of the Supreme Court Act , a judge of the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to award costs against a party in favour of a non-party, although that jurisdiction will be exercised only in exceptional cases and with considerable caution. </sentence>
