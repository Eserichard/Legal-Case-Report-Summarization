<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 613">The Minister has not sought to uphold the Tribunal's decision on the basis that it made findings of fact which could be sufficient if the Tribunal had addressed issues under ss.36(3) , (4) and (5) (compare my earlier decisions of SZEAS v Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 1776 &amp; SZFKD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 46). Nor does the Minister submit that the applicant would inevitably have failed if the Tribunal had made findings under s.36(3) , (4) and (5). I do not consider that I could make that finding, in circumstances where the Indian domestic laws and immigration practices relating to the India Nepal Treaty of Friendship appear not to be clear (compare my judgments cited above and SZGXK v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 822 , also SZGXK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1891 , SZGXK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] HCASL 170 , WAGH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 194 ; (2003) 131 FCR 269 , SZLAN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 ; (2008) 171 FCR 145 , and SZMWQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2010] FCAFC 97). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 97">99 Views have thus been expressed as to whether the term " right " refers to an " existing legally enforceable right " ( WAGH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 194 at [32] , [2003] FCAFC 194 ; 131 FCR 269 (" WAGH ") at 278 per Lee J; SZLAN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 at [68] , [2008] FCA 904 ; 171 FCR 145 at 162 per Graham J) or a practical ability to enter and reside in a country and obtain protection ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Applicant C [2001] FCA 1332 at [20] to [21] [2001] FCA 1332 ; , 116 FCR 154 at 161 (" Applicant C ") per Stone J (Gray and Lee JJ agreeing); WAGH at [54] per Hill J). The phrase in s 36(3) , " however that right arose or is expressed ", has been relied upon by Allsop J in V856/00A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1018 , 114 FCR 408 as indicating that " the source and incidents of the right can be diverse ". His Honour continued:
 [31] ... It also assists in the recognition that "right" is intended to be a wide conception. Especially in the light of the above phrase, I see no reason to restrict the meaning of the word "right" to a right in the strict sense which is legally enforceable and which is found reflected in the positive law of the state in question or to exclude from the meaning the notion of liberty, permission or privilege lawfully given, albeit capable of withdrawal and not capable of any particular enforcement, or to exclude from the meaning a liberty or permission or privilege which does not give rise to any particular duty upon the state in question. Such a liberty, permission or privilege would obtain its effective substance from its grant and thereafter from the lack of any withdrawal of it and from the lack of any existing prohibition or law contrary to its exercise, rather than from the existence within the positive law of the state in question of a correlative duty, justiciable and enforceable in law, to recognise the right. It may be that in many cases if the right is to survive outside, and divorced from residence in, the country in question it may well be a right in the strict sense, but I do not think that that conclusion follows as a matter of statutory construction.  75 Section 36(3) , (4) and (5) were incorporated by way of amendments effected by the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Act 1999 (Cth). In SZLAN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 at [51] to [52] [2008] FCA 904 ; , 171 FCR 145 at 158 (" SZLAN "), Graham J helpfully set forth extracts from both the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum and the Tabling Speech when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs introduced these amendments. As extracted, the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum stated as follows: 
 3 New subsection 36(3) is an interpretive provision relating to Australia's protection obligations. This provision provides that Australia does not owe protection obligations to a non-citizen who has not taken all possible steps to avail him or herself of a right to enter and reside in another country.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 169">In support of ground 1 the counsel for the applicant referred to the decision of Gray J in SZLAN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 [2008] FCA 904 ; (2008) 171 FCR 145 ; (2008) 102 ALD 131 , where his Honour said: [79] It would seem to me that the Tribunal identified a relevant particular social group, being wealthy Nepalis, but failed to address whether the extortionate demands placed upon the first appellant were simply because of his perceived personal capacity to provide an advantage for a self interested extorting party or whether the extortionate demands were placed upon the first appellant because he belonged to a particular social group. [80] In an extortion case, as indicated above, there is the possibility that the extortive activity has a dual character; it may be motivated by a personal interest on the perpetrator's part but also may be Convention-related. Given that the demands placed upon the first appellant were said to be demands by a Maoist union, the Tribunal should, in my opinion, have addressed whether the persecution of the first appellant was for a Convention-related reason as a member of the particular social group made up of wealthy Nepalis and not simply motivated by a personal interest on the perpetrator's behalf. It should have recognised that extortive activity can have a dual character and considered whether the essential and significant reason for such activity was Convention based. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1543">When questioned on this, the applicant acknowledged that he had a right of return to Singapore as he is a permanent resident there. Based on the above, the Tribunal finds that the applicant has a right of entry and residence in Singapore at this time. 
 

 
No submissions were advanced in the present appeal that the Appellant's ability to enter Singapore was not a " right " within the meaning of and for the purposes of s 36(3): cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Applicant C [2001] FCA 1332 , 116 FCR 154 ; SZLAN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 , 171 FCR 145. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 1197">The effect of s.36(3) is that if an applicant fails to demonstrate that he or she has taken all reasonable steps to exercise such legally enforceable entry and residency rights as he or she may have in another country, Australia is taken not to have protection obligations to that person: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Applicant C [2001] FCA 1332 ; (2001) 116 FCR 154 ; SZLAN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 ; (2008) 171 FCR 145 at 159 [58] . Given that the applicant had not sought to travel to and take up residence in Spain, s.36(3) required the Tribunal to determine whether such rights as the applicant had to go to Spain and remain there for a period amounted to a "right to enter and reside" there. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 737">Australia's protection obligations will be excluded by s.36(3) if an applicant fails to demonstrate that he or she has taken all reasonable steps to exercise such entry and residency rights as he or she may hold in another country: SZLAN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 at [58] . </sentence>

Rajaratnam v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1111 ( Rajaratnam ) and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1134 ; (1999) 95 FCR 517. However, as Graham J noted in SZLAN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 , at [40]: 
 ... it needs to be recognised that the reason why an extorting party has an interest in another may or may not have foundation in a Convention reason. A person upon whom extortionate demands have been placed may have become the subject of extortion because he or she belongs to a social group identified by a Convention criterion. 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 304">The multi-faceted nature of extortion was also considered by Graham J on appeal from this Court in SZLAN v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 904. First, in relation to s.91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) at [37] - [41] and then in relation to the particular facts of that case which were similar to those of the one currently before me. At [76] - [80] his Honour found that the Tribunal, having identified the applicant as a member of a particular social group of " wealthy Nepalis " should have addressed whether the persecution of the applicant was for a Convention-related reason as a member of that social group and not simply motivated by personal interest on the perpetrator's behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 173">As regards the Tribunal's finding in relation to s 36(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) - namely, that the appellant had not taken all possible steps to avail himself of the right to enter and reside in another EU country, the Federal Magistrate approved the observations of Graham J in SZLAN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 ; (2008) 171 FCR 145 at [158] , at [53] ( SZLAN ) to the following effect: 
 Section 36(3) of the Act directs attention to taking steps to avail oneself of a right to enter and reside in a country. It is not directed to the consequences of entering and residing in a country. The relevant right in respect of which a non-citizen must take all possible steps to avail himself is the bare right, if it exists, to enter and reside in a country, not a right to enter and reside comfortably in a country. 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1891">24 I have, in an earlier judgment, SZLAN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 ('SZLAN'), referred to s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'); to s 420 of the Act; to s 36(2) of the Act; to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967 (collectively referred to as 'the Convention') and to the introduction into the Act of ss 36(3) and (7) and ss 91M and 91R , all of which were inserted into the Act by the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Act 1999 (Cth). In SZLAN , I attempted to analyse s 36(3) of the Act by addressing three separate questions which were set out at [56] of my reasons for judgment. The second of those questions was:
 
 
 '(b) Is the subsection only engaged where the 'right to enter and reside in' another country is a legally enforceable right? ...' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1807">19 I agree with the observations of the Tribunal in that regard and draw attention to what I said about a particular social group in SZLAN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 904 , in particular at [43]-[46]. There may be numerous individuals who could be identified as Triad betrayers but in my opinion, that does not make them a cognisable group in society. There is nothing to unite such individuals as a social group of the kind contemplated by the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 as amended by the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 21 January 1967 (the 'Refugees Convention').</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 1588">For the sake of completeness I would also indicate that I fully accept the views expressed by Graham J in SZLAN &amp; SZLAO v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 904 at [53] where his Honour says: " Section 36(3) of the Act directs attention to taking steps to avail oneself of a right to enter and reside in a country. It is not directed to the consequences of entering and residing in a country. The relevant right in respect of which a non-citizen must take all possible steps to avail himself is the bare right, if it exists, to enter and reside in a country, not a right to enter and reside comfortably in a country. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 822">The statutory exclusion only applies if the applicant "has not taken all possible steps to avail himself or herself of a right to enter and reside in, whether temporarily or permanently and however that right arose or is expressed, any country apart from Australia ...". On Full Court authority which is binding on me, the reference to "a right to enter and reside in" the other country means "a legally enforceable right" of the applicant recognised under that country's domestic laws. This was the effect of Stone J's judgment in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Applicant C [2001] FCA 1332 ; (2001) 116 FCR 154 at [62] , with whom Gray and Lee JJ agreed, where she approved the interpretation of the primary judge set out at [35] and [36]. Doubts have been expressed by other Federal Court justices in relation to this interpretation, most recently by Graham J in SZLAN v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 904 at [60] - [67] , but I have not been able to identify any subsequent opinion which I am bound to prefer (cf. SZGME v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 91 at [42] ). </sentence>
