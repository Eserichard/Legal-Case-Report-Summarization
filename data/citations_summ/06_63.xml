<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 142">An examination of the above cases indicates that a penalty (including costs) or fine imposed in respect of disciplinary proceedings is not a penalty or fine imposed by a court in respect of an offence against a law for the purposes of s.82(3) of the Bankruptcy Act . The REBA Act distinguishes between "offence" and "disciplinary action", and deals separately with a range of specified offences. [14] The fact that it does so is a clear indication of an intent on the part of the State Parliament that penalties and fines imposed as disciplinary action do not constitute an offence. There would be nothing to preclude criminal proceedings in respect of the same conduct as had given rise to disciplinary action. [15] The Court therefore concludes penalties and fines imposed in disciplinary proceedings do not fall within the ordinary meaning of the word "offence", and their exclusion from the application of s.82(3) of the Bankruptcy Act is consistent with the policy of the Bankruptcy Act . The Court accepts that the costs component of the SAT Orders is compensatory in nature, rather than in the form of a penalty. [16] </sentence>
