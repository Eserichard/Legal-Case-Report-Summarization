<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1714">In MZWHU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1387 at [22] , Middleton J summarised the principles applicable to determining whether an application should be dismissed on the grounds of res judicata: The rule of res judicata is that, generally speaking, no proceeding can be maintained on a cause of action upon which judgment has been entered. The cause of action is said to merge in the judgment, in the sense that it no longer has an existence independent of the judgment. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 2116">16 Whether the Federal Magistrate was right to conclude that the appellant was prevented from raising these matters pursuant to the doctrine of res judicata may be put to one side: cf Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 242 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10 at [39] and MZWHU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1387 (" MZWHU ") and the authorities cited. On any view, the commencement of this proceeding by the appellant was and remains an abuse of process. The proceeding was doomed to fail. It is the latest in the history of repeated litigation over a period of approximately 
10 years during which the appellant has unsuccessfully sought to establish error in a decision of the delegate made on 9 October 1997. The appellant did not raise any matter which would permit him to reagitate issues already considered and determined against him by the Tribunal, the Federal Magistrates Court and the Federal Court: for example, see SBFF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 178 ; (2007) 158 FCR 49 at [23] ; MZWHU at [30] and [31]; SZFOG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1170 at [22] - [29]; SZATR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 986 at [16] - [18]; SYVB v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCA 1093 at [16] and by the Full Court in Chu Sing Wun v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 314 at 323 (per Carr and Sundberg JJ) and 346-347 (per Kiefel J).

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 2115">20 While the appellant asserted that the political climate in Sri Lanka had become more unstable, it is apparent that the current proceeding does not raise any issue that was not addressed in the earlier Federal Court proceedings by Heerey J. Whether the Federal Magistrate was right to conclude that the appellant was prevented from bringing the claim pursuant to the doctrines of res judicata and further or alternatively, issue estoppel may be put to one side: cf Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 242 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10 at [39] and MZWHU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1387 (" MZWHU ") and the authorities cited.
