<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 529">39 In her oral submissions, Ms Bowskill drew particular attention to the duties imposed on the Registrar by the Act with respect to the establishment and maintenance of the Register. Those duties were considered by Justice Kiefel in Wakaman People v Native Title Registrar [2006] FCA 1251 at [8] :
 The Register is a public document, to be available for inspection (s 187(1)). The provisions of the NTA concerning its maintenance suggest that it is intended to reflect the current state of affairs with respect to claims. Section 186(1)(ca) requires the date upon which the claim is entered on the Register to be included in it. The Registrar is required 'as soon as practicable' to include in the Register details of any claim accepted for registration under s 190A (s 190(1)(a)) and must likewise amend the Register where there is an amended application which complies with the Act's requirements and remove any entry relating to the claim where it does not: s 190(2) and (3). The Registrar must also take prompt action to remove entries where a claim has been withdrawn, dismissed or finalised: s 190(4). The need for the Register to reflect the current state of claims is confirmed by the Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (in connexion with s 190(2)). </sentence>
