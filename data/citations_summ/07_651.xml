<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] NSWSC 1341">11 In Brereton v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 651 Finkelstein J held that a shareholder of a solvent company who stands to lose his or her capital has a sufficient basis for standing (at [4]), and he expressed the opinion that there was a strong argument in favour of holding that a former director of a solvent company would also have standing (at [5]), though he found it unnecessary to resolve that question. The authorities to which his Honour's attention was drawn on this point were decided in the 1980s, and his attention does not appear to have been drawn to more recent cases (see Butterworths' Australian Corporations Law: Principles and Practice (looseleaf), vol 2, [5.6.0 555], note 20) including the decision of Young CJ in Eq in Casali v Crisp , which has been followed in this and other courts ( Euphron Pty Ltd (in liq) v Hunter Valley Piggery Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 543 at [12] ; Melluish v Underwood Development Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 429 at [6] ; Warton v Harris [2005] NSWSC 1168 ; (2005) 56 ACSR 122 at [4] ; Jones v 3R Gas Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 290 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 450 at [8] ; Piccoli Tesori Pty Ltd (Deregistered); Ex parte Bertuol [2006] FCA 462 ; (2006) 151 FCR 109 at [23] ; Herbert v Nozala Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1437 at [38] ; Callegher v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 482 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 438 at [50] and [53]; Middleton Nominees Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corp [2007] FCA 845 at [6] ).</sentence>
