<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 225">Lindgren J, in Clark v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1076 ; (2007) 161 FCR 451 dealt with the expression the special circumstances of the case in the context of s 1184K of the Act. He said that the expression: is a reference to circumstances of the case which make it unusual or out of the ordinary run (at 138) . His Honour said the notion is referable to some understanding of the usual or ordinary circumstances to which the provision in question was intended to apply. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 600">Lindgren J, in Clark v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1076 ; (2007) 161 FCR 451 dealt with the expression the special circumstances of the case in the context of s 1184K of the Act. He said that the expression: is a reference to circumstances of the case which make it unusual or out of the ordinary run (at 138). His Honour said the notion is referable to some understanding of the usual or ordinary circumstances to which the provision in question was intended to apply. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 248">Mr Holder also argued that it was unfair on Ms Still for Centrelink to adopt the approach it did in determining the preclusion period of 17 weeks. In Clark v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1076 , Lindgren J referred to the judgment of Kiefel J in Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67. In analysing the judgment of Keifel J, Lindgren J said (at paragraph 75): 
 
 "I respectfully agree with the approach that was taken by Keifel J. The expression 'special circumstances' in s 1184K does not embrace the circumstance that the 50 percent rule will yield a preclusion period beginning on a certain date that will or may be excessive, even grossly excessive, having regard to the component included in a lump sum settlement for loss of earnings or of earning capacity, to the age of the injured person, and perhaps to other circumstances. " 
 

 
In the Tribunal's opinion, the adoption of the formula in s 1170(4) of the Act to determine the preclusion period in Ms Still's case does not, in itself, constitute special circumstances.
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 986">As mentioned above, Ms Giaretto contended that the factor referred to in paragraph 41(e) above, is not an unusual circumstance. In support of this aspect of her argument, Ms Welfare referred in particular to a passage from the judgment of Lindgren J in Clark v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1076 at [75] , which suggested that even a gross disparity between the statutory formula and the amount actually recovered for loss of earnings cannot be a special circumstance at all. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] AATA 250">The respondent drew my attention to the judgment of Lindgren J in Clark v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1076 ; (2007) 161 FCR 451 at [75] : 
 The expression "special circumstances" in s 1184K does not embrace the circumstance that the 50% rule will yield a preclusion period beginning on a certain date that will or may be excessive, even grossly excessive, having regard to the component included in a lump sum settlement for loss of earnings or of earning capacity, to the age of the injured person, and perhaps to other circumstances. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] AATA 240">However, I am aware that Lindgren J in Clark v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1076 ; (2007) 161 FCR 451 at [75] found: The expression "special circumstances" in s 1184K does not embrace the circumstance that the 50% rule will yield a preclusion period beginning on a certain date that will or may be excessive, even grossly excessive, having regard to the component included in a lump sum settlement for loss of earnings or of earning capacity, to the age of the injured person, and perhaps to other circumstances. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] AATA 1888">The Applicant's circumstances are however little different from many other social security recipients. The manner in which the lump sum provisions of the Social Security Act operate to act in certain cases to cause hardship, but in cases such as Clark v Secretary Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1076 the Federal Court has pointed out that enquiries as to the operation of the recovery provisions of the SSA vis a vis the sum actually obtained is to defeat the legislative intention and will result in appealable error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] AATA 1860">Further, as Kiefel J noted in Chamberlain at [34]-[35] and Lindgren J noted in Clark v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1076 ; (2007) 96 ALD 129 at [75] : 
 "The expression "special circumstances" in s 1184K does not embrace the circumstance that the 50% rule will yield a preclusion period beginning on a certain date that will or may be excessive, even grossly excessive, having regard to the component included in a lump sum settlement for loss of earnings or of earning capacity, to the age of the injured person, and perhaps to other circumstances.
