<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 27">The third respondent referred to what Gordon J said in White v Designated Manager of IP Australia (No 2) [2008] FCA 816 ; (2008) 171 FCR 15 at [19] : 
 
 '[T]he purposive approach to statutory construction is not a carte blanche licence to courts to depart from unambiguous plain meaning. While purpose may sometimes be used to add, subtract, or clarify words in a statute or regulation ( Saraswati [1991] HCA 21 ; 172 CLR 1 at 22), 
 

 
 
 
 ... where the text of a legislative provision is grammatically capable of only one meaning and neither the context nor any purpose of the Act throws any real doubt on that meaning, the grammatical meaning is "the ordinary meaning" to be applied. A court cannot depart from "the ordinary meaning" of a legislative provision simply because that meaning produces anomalies[. ]'

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1401">26 The Commissioner's response to this argument was to acknowledge the differing result in each case but note that the legislature had to draw a line somewhere and the line might as well be based on location, which creates a bright-line rule that is easy to administer. In effect, the parties entered into the age-old debate of flexible standards versus bright-line rules. I recently dealt with this debate in White v Designated Manager of IP Australia (No. 2) [2008] FCA 816 at [44] . I do not propose to repeat the discussion in White as to the virtues and vices of each. Instead, I note two points particularly relevant to the choice in this case.  11 In Kelly v The Queen [2004] HCA 12 ; (2004) 218 CLR 216 , 253, McHugh J said that "[n]othing is more likely to defeat the intention of the legislature than to give a definition a narrow, literal meaning and then use that meaning to negate the evident policy or purpose of a substantive enactment. " Indeed, it is now well established that there is no need for ambiguity in the statutory text before resort is had to purpose, context, and the legislative history: White v Designated Manager of IP Australia (No. 2) [2008] FCA 816 at [18] - [20]. </sentence>
