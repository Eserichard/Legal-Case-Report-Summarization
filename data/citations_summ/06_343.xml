<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 246">The section covers both oral and written communications. [1] The type of disputes covered is defined in s.131(5)(a) as 'a dispute of a kind in respect of which relief may be given in an Australian or overseas proceeding' . [2] Further, s.131(5)(c) makes it clear that a reference to a communication by a person in dispute includes a reference to a communication made by an 'employee or agent' [3] of such a person. I am satisfied that the conversation between Ms Ganesh and Mr Stephens, as recorded --- and I note Mr Stephens challenges the veracity of the content --- was a communication between agents of the debtor and the creditor which was in connection with an attempt to settle the matter and avoid the proceedings listed before the court the following day. It, therefore, falls squarely within the exclusion in s.131(1)(a). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSC 589">In Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd, [16] Graham J held that for a communication to answer the description of one "in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement" of a dispute, there must be a direct connection.</sentence>
