<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] HCA 19">A fourth representation, arriving out of a statement made by the program's compere, was found to have been made by the respondents in the second broadcast [9] . It was [10] : 
 
 "the women had made millions of dollars through investing in property". 
 
  The Commission's contention that these episodes contravened s 52 was upheld by the Federal Court of Australia (Bennett J). On the strength of an unchallenged affidavit by Dymphna Boholt, the trial judge held that in the first episode the respondents made a misleading and deceptive representation that Dymphna Boholt owned in excess of 60 properties [38] . The trial judge also found, on the strength of an unchallenged affidavit by Sandra Forster, that in the first episode the respondents made misleading and deceptive representations that she had purchased over $1 million worth of property and was a millionaire. And the trial judge found that in the second episode the respondents made a misleading and deceptive representation that Sandra Forster had made millions investing in property. These conclusions are not now in controversy, and no fresh demonstration of their validity is now called for. However, the learned Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth, who appeared for the Commission, did take the Court through parts of the broadcasts. That process certainly revealed the broadcasts as tasteless, as vulgar, as pandering to the basest of human desires, and as highly likely to achieve both popular and critical acclaim.

Australia, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 13 September 1984 at 1296. [62] Sun Earth Homes Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1993) 45 FCR 265. The trial judge referred to this case at Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Seven Network Ltd [2007] FCA 1505 ; (2007) 244 ALR 343 at 363 [86] . [63] Beckwith v The Queen [1976] HCA 55 ; (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 576; [1976] HCA 55. [64] Channel Seven Brisbane Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCAFC 114 ; (2008) 249 ALR 97 at 107 [49] - [50]. This leaves for consideration the point raised by the notice of contention. It was not argued by the respondents that there was not a contract, arrangement or understanding between them and the two women operating the Wildly Wealthy Women Millionaire Mentoring Program. The point in contention is whether the contract, arrangement or understanding must relate to the specific representations made in the publication or whether it suffices that the publication is made pursuant to the terms of the contract, arrangement or understanding. The primary judge found that it was sufficient that the arrangement extend only to the content of the publication in a general sense [31] . The respondents contended that this formulation was too nebulous. It would drive a "coach and horse" through the exemption. They argued that the contract, arrangement or understanding must relate to the actual content of the relevant publication or broadcast. The exception to the exemption would apply where the contract, arrangement or understanding covered the script or text of the publication or broadcast and the script or text was found to have been misleading or deceptive.
  The Commission submitted that a factor pointing against the correctness of the respondents' construction was that, if it were correct, there would be "subtle forms of conduct (and myriad others like them)" which would be immune from s 52 and the other relevant provisions of the Act . This would arise, according to the Commission, because these subtle forms of conduct would not be "advertisements" within the meaning of s 65A(1)(b), and the respondents' construction would leave the promotion of goods and services of a person other than the prescribed information provider within the immunity, and not removed from the immunity by s 65A(1)(b). That would create what the trial judge described as a "gap" in cases [73] :
 
 
 "where the publication concerned the sale or supply of commercial subject-matter but was made on behalf of the third person or pursuant to an agreement that could not be described as 'an advertisement'. " 
 
 
 The Commission gave three examples. One was the example employed by the Minister in his Second Reading Speech. Another was the adoption by a radio broadcaster as programme content of a press release issued by a supplier of goods or services, in circumstances where the supplier sponsored the programme (rather than contracting for placement of specific advertisements) and where there was an understanding that the supplier's press releases would receive air time. Another example was a publication concerning a complaint about or criticism of goods or services made pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with a competitor of the supplier of the goods or services criticised, in exchange for the competitor taking out paid advertising; the publication would occur not merely in order to provide news or information, but to fulfil the terms of the arrangement or understanding. 

  On 26 September 2005, the appellant, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, commenced proceedings against the four respondents, their holding company Seven Network Ltd, the two women and a company called Universal Prosperity Pty Ltd ("Universal") controlled by Ms Forster. The appellant alleged contraventions of s 52 of the TPA by all of them except Seven Network Ltd [4] . It claimed, inter alia, that, by their broadcasts about the Wildly Wealthy Women mentoring program on Today Tonight , the respondents had made representations about the benefits of the services offered by Ms Boholt and Ms Forster and that those representations were misleading or deceptive. Declaratory and injunctive relief and non-punitive orders under s 86C(1) of the TPA were sought.
  An argument from clarity. One of the trial judge's reasons for preferring the Commission's construction was that if [71] :
 
 
 "para (a) were intended to refer to goods or services and interests in land that were of the 'relevant' kind only, the [drafting] could have made that clear within subparas (a)(i)-(iv) or in (vi). " 
 
 
 The Full Court met that contention in the following words [72] : 

 
 
 "[T]he drafter could not use the defined term 'relevant goods and services' in s 65A(3), 65A(1)(a)(vi)(A) or (B) because, as defined, 'relevant goods or services' only applies to a prescribed information provider and s 65A(1)(a)(vi)(A) and (B) are directed to persons and corporations who may not be prescribed information providers. So the drafter has used the expression 'goods and services of that kind' referring to the goods or services in the definition which is incorporated in s 65A(1)(a)(v). The trial judge said [13] :
 
 
 "Viewing the first episode as a whole, the Seven licensees embraced and advanced the proposition that Ms Boholt and Ms Forster were millionaires and had achieved that status through investing in property. Those propositions were adopted and stated as fact by the reporter. In context, what was 'put up for examination' by the compere was whether others could achieve millionaire status by participation in the mentoring program. The respondents' submission was that s 65A(1)(a)(v) deprives a prescribed information provider of immunity in relation to a publication of matter promoting its own goods or services or interests in land or (by reason of the definition of "relevant goods or services" and "relevant interests in land") those of a related body corporate; that s 65A(1)(a)(vi) deprives it of immunity in relation to a publication of matter on behalf of, or pursuant to a contract, arrangement or understanding with, a third party or a related body corporate who supplies the prescribed information provider's goods or services or interests in land or those of a related body corporate; and that s 65A(1)(b) deprives a prescribed information provider of immunity from publishing an advertisement for the products of others. Inherent in this submission was a submission that the words in s 65A(1)(a)(vi) "of that kind" in relation to services referred not to the services mentioned in s 65A(1)(a)(i) and (iii), but to those mentioned in s 65A(1)(a)(v) --- the "relevant ... services", ie those supplied by the prescribed information provider. The trial judge disagreed with that submission [51] . The trial judge held that s 65A(1)(a)(vi)(A) was satisfied on the basis that the respondents broadcast the episodes pursuant to their contract, arrangement or understanding with Dymphna Boholt and Sandra Forster made on 20 October 2003 [52] . On this basis Dymphna Boholt and Sandra Forster supplied services "of that kind" because the trial judge considered that those words referred to the services mentioned in s 65A(1)(a)(i) or (iii). 
  The transcripts of the two segments of the Today Tonight program broadcast in October 2003 and January 2004 were set out in the judgment of the primary judge. It is not necessary to refer to them in detail here. The nature and content of the broadcasts and the statements made by the compere and reporter in each of them were sufficient, as the Full Court held, to support her Honour's finding that a number of representations, which were misleading or deceptive, were made by the respondents. Three such representations, each based on a statement made by the reporter, were found to have arisen out of the first broadcast [7] . They were [8] :
 
 (i) Ms Boholt owned in excess of 60 properties. 

 
 (ii) Ms Forster had purchased over $1 million worth of property using none of her own money. 

 
 (iii) Ms Forster was a millionaire. 

  Both the Commission and the respondents relied on the following statement by the Minister in the Second Reading Speech [56] :
 
 
 "The Government recognises the need to maintain a [vigorous] free press, as well as an effective and enforceable [Act]. " 
 
 
 These words are too vague to indicate what the precise construction of the words "of that kind" in s 65A(1)(a)(vi) is. Although the trial judge said that the point at issue in these proceedings "is not directly addressed" in that Speech [57] , when the Minister turned to discussion of the circumstances in which the exemption conferred by the opening words of s 65A(1) did not exist, he said this [58] : 

 
 
 "The exemption is not available, however, in respect of a publication of information relating to goods, services or land of a kind supplied by the information provider, or relating to goods, services or land where the publication is made pursuant to a contract, arrangement or understanding with a body corporate related to a body corporate that supplies such goods, services or land. " (emphasis added) 
 
 
 The first part of that sentence summarises s 65A(1)(a)(v). The second part of that sentence refers to s 65A(1)(a)(vi)(A) and (B), and though it telescopes those provisions, it affords room for the respondents to submit that it made plain the meaning of "goods or services of that kind" in s 65A(1)(a)(vi)(A) for the purposes permitted by s 15AB(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act . The transcripts of the two segments of the Today Tonight program broadcast in October 2003 and January 2004 were set out in the judgment of the primary judge. It is not necessary to refer to them in detail here. The nature and content of the broadcasts and the statements made by the compere and reporter in each of them were sufficient, as the Full Court held, to support her Honour's finding that a number of representations, which were misleading or deceptive, were made by the respondents. Three such representations, each based on a statement made by the reporter, were found to have arisen out of the first broadcast [7] . They were [8] :
 
 (i) Ms Boholt owned in excess of 60 properties. 

 
 (ii) Ms Forster had purchased over $1 million worth of property using none of her own money. 

 
 (iii) Ms Forster was a millionaire. 

  In this respect the trial judge's reasoning, which the Commission adopted, is open, with respect, to criticism. She said [69] :
 
 
 "(v) and (vi) are alternatives: if (vi) is read in the absence of (v), 'goods or services of that kind' would refer to the goods or services of the kind to be supplied, described in para (a). " 
 
 
 Even if that were true, it does not follow that sub-par (vi) has the same meaning once a court takes into account, as it must, the existence of sub-par (v) and reads it alongside sub-par (vi). 

  The disclaimer did not detract from the Wildly Wealthy Women representations. When the first episode is viewed as a whole, the ordinary and reasonable viewer would consider those representations to have been made by the Seven licensees. " 
 
 
 Her Honour also rejected an argument by the respondents that the compere had effectively entered a disclaimer in the second episode [14] . 

  The respondents argued that, in the first broadcast, the compere had made a disclaimer about the truth of the claims made by the two women by saying [11] : 
 
 
 "we'll see if the two ladies behind the program can live up to their promises over the next 12 months". 
 
 
 And [12] : 

 
 
 "Too good to be true? Well we'll be following the scheme's progress to let you know. " 
 
  The respondents' submission was that s 65A(1)(a)(v) deprives a prescribed information provider of immunity in relation to a publication of matter promoting its own goods or services or interests in land or (by reason of the definition of "relevant goods or services" and "relevant interests in land") those of a related body corporate; that s 65A(1)(a)(vi) deprives it of immunity in relation to a publication of matter on behalf of, or pursuant to a contract, arrangement or understanding with, a third party or a related body corporate who supplies the prescribed information provider's goods or services or interests in land or those of a related body corporate; and that s 65A(1)(b) deprives a prescribed information provider of immunity from publishing an advertisement for the products of others. Inherent in this submission was a submission that the words in s 65A(1)(a)(vi) "of that kind" in relation to services referred not to the services mentioned in s 65A(1)(a)(i) and (iii), but to those mentioned in s 65A(1)(a)(v) --- the "relevant ... services", ie those supplied by the prescribed information provider. The trial judge disagreed with that submission [51] . The trial judge held that s 65A(1)(a)(vi)(A) was satisfied on the basis that the respondents broadcast the episodes pursuant to their contract, arrangement or understanding with Dymphna Boholt and Sandra Forster made on 20 October 2003 [52] . On this basis Dymphna Boholt and Sandra Forster supplied services "of that kind" because the trial judge considered that those words referred to the services mentioned in s 65A(1)(a)(i) or (iii).

  The application came on for trial before Bennett J in the Federal Court. On 5 October 2007, her Honour gave judgment in favour of the appellant [5] . There had been no allegation and no evidence presented that the holding company, Seven Network Ltd, had published any matter or engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct. Her Honour granted injunctive and declaratory relief against the respondent broadcasters and ordered that they pay three quarters of the appellant's costs of the proceedings. Ms Boholt, Ms Forster and Universal had previously agreed with the appellant on forms of order to dispose of the proceedings as against them. Ms Boholt and Ms Forster provided affidavit evidence for use by the appellant in its case against the respondents. 
  The next two questions are the primary constructional questions upon which this appeal turns:
 
 (iv) Do the goods or services referred to in s 65A(1)(a)(vi) as "goods or services of that kind" mean goods or services of the kind the subject of the publication referred to in s 65A(1)(a)(i) and (iii)? or 

 
 (v) Do they mean only goods or services of the same kind as the "relevant goods or services" mentioned in s 65A(1)(a)(v)? 

 
 The first construction, proposed in question (iv), yields a wider exception to the exemption than the second, proposed in question (v). The first was that adopted by the primary judge [20] . The second was that adopted by the Full Court [21] . 

  A fourth representation, arriving out of a statement made by the program's compere, was found to have been made by the respondents in the second broadcast [9] . It was [10] : 
 
 "the women had made millions of dollars through investing in property". 
 
  Ms Forster swore an affidavit in the proceedings setting out her assets. Her evidence was not challenged. As at 31 October 2003 her assets did not exceed $65,000 before taking into account liabilities of at least $8,000. As at 30 January 2004, they did not exceed $115,000 before taking into account liabilities of at least $8,000. Ms Boholt swore an affidavit, also unchallenged, in which she said, inter alia, that as at 31 October 2003 she "did not own over 60 properties". The primary judge found that each of the four representations made by the respondents was misleading and deceptive [15] .

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 2034">30 Counsel for the applicants referred to a recent decision of the Court concerning s 65A: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Seven Network Limited [2007] FCA 1505. It was delivered on 5 October 2007 (the day that the applicants filed and served their submissions in support of this application). It was submitted that, in this decision, Bennett J at [77] and [80] had placed a different construction upon s 65A to that of French J at [42] and that on the construction of the section adopted in the Seven Network decision, it is arguable that the applicants' case has reasonable prospect of success. </sentence>
