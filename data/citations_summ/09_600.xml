<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 935">The applicant applied for particulars of the events and transactions the respondent alleged would have occurred had the scheme identified by him not been entered into and the essential terms on which it was alleged that those events and transactions would have been implemented. That application was refused by a judge of this Court: Futuris Corporation Limited (ACN 004 336 636) v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 600. In the course of his reasons, Mansfield J said ([34]-[35]): 
 
 "It would be nonsensical for the Commissioner to "suggest" a possible series of transactions that the applicant might have undertaken which might have led to the relevant amount being included in the assessable income, because such suggestion could only be a matter of conjecture and, if disproved, would leave the Court no better informed and having come no further to answer the question of whether Part IVA of the ITAA 1936 applies. It is for the applicant, who bears the onus, to establish the series of transactions or arrangements which, it contends, would have or might reasonably be expected to have been entered into or carried out and which would have or might reasonably be expected to have resulted in the relevant amount being obtained as a tax benefit regardless of the scheme. 
 

 
 
 In addition, as was acknowledged in the course of submissions, it is not enough for the applicant to disprove any alternative postulate put up by the respondent (assuming the scheme is shown to exist as asserted by the respondent). If it is to succeed on its application, it must also adduce evidence which satisfies the Court that it had an alternative postulate which it would have been able to implement and which would have resulted in the same taxable position as if the scheme which (arguendo) has been set aside had remained in place, or which would have resulted in some other taxable position.
