<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 782">11 These findings of the Tribunal were based upon a consideration of the entirety of the evidence which was placed before it, including the evidence advanced by the now Appellant. Those findings of the Tribunal were open to it to be made. Clearly, the ultimate findings and reasons were based upon an assessment of the Appellant's credibility. The task of making those findings has been entrusted to the Tribunal, and not the Federal Magistrates Court or (more relevantly) to this Court on appeal: Nguyen v Migration Review Tribunal [2008] FCA 524 at [15] per Logan J. Findings of credibility are findings " par excellence " entrusted to the Tribunal: Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 at [67] , [2000] HCA 1 ; 168 ALR 407 at 423 per McHugh J; SZKQQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 242 at [21] per Middleton J; SZEOQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 257 at [27] per Lander J. </sentence>
