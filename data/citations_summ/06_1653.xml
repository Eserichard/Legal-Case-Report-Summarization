<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 209">In VBAM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCA 504 at [44] Gray J said: 
 "The evidence of the three witnesses was information that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application. " 

 
His Honour did not refer to the terms of s 426 when arriving at that conclusion. That decision was followed by Gordon J in SZIAT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 766 at [39] . She also referred to Bennett J's decision in SZAQI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1653 at [23] - [24]. There, Bennett J again referred to the concept of an applicant calling a witness to give oral evidence on his or her behalf as being within the scope of s 424A(3)(b). Bennett J distinguished the contrary construction by Branson J in SZECG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 733 at [17] - [22]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 813">The inconsistencies between the brother's testimony and the testimony of the appellant was not information and therefore not subject to s.424A(1): SZBYR [2007] HCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at [18] . [39] Further, the evidence of the appellant's brother was called on by the appellant. It was information given by the appellant for the purpose of her application for review and is therefore excluded information: s 424A(3)(b) of the Act (see also VBAM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCA 504 at [44] and SZAQI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1653 at [24] . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 766">39 Further, the evidence of the appellant's brother was called on by the appellant. It was information given by the appellant for the purpose of her application for review and is therefore excluded information: s 424A(3)(b) of the Act (see also VBAM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCA 504 at [44] and SZAQI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1653 at [24] .
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 453">The first respondent relied upon the decision of SZAQI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1653 , a decision of Bennett J which, the first respondent argued, said that there was no need to provide a s.359A letter in relation to information provided by a witness called by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 392">Branson J followed that later decision in SZECG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 733. In that case, Branson J held that the appellant had not given information to the Tribunal by advising the Tribunal that he wanted the Tribunal to take evidence from his father. A different conclusion in relation to the evidence of a witness was arrived at in SZAQI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1653. The applicant's evidence in that case was contradicted by a witness who the applicant asked to be called in a letter written to the Tribunal. Bennett J contrasted that situation where evidence was 'called by the Tribunal as part of its inquisitorial function (cf SAAP)'.</sentence>
