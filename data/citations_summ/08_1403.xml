<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 981">Fullagar J's view has been applied to provisions similar to ss 39 and 40 by the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory: Nationwide News Pty Ltd 
 v Bradshaw [1986] NTSC 40 ; (1986) 84 FLR 49 , and the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory: Nicholl v Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Ltd (1990) 101 FLR 356. In this Court, Fullagar J's view that trial without jury is the normal mode of trial and that some special reason must be shown for a departure, has been followed or referred to with approval in relation to ss 39 and 40 of the Federal Court Act by Jenkinson J in Construction Industry Long Service Leave Board v Odco Pty Ltd (No 2) (1988) ATPR 40-887 ; Sackville J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Matthews [1999] FCA 706 ; by Whitlam J in Dinnison v Commonwealth of Australia [2000] FCA 1841 ; (2000) 106 FCR 418 and by Beaumont J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Rigg [2001] FCA 590. The approach of Northrop J in Insurance Commissioner has been followed or commented on with approval in this Court by Tamberlin J in Stalyce Holdings (Aust) Pty Ltd v Cetec Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 278 ; Hely J in Gargan v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2004] FCA 641 ; and by Flick J in Harding 
 v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1403. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 706">Mr Lazarus submits that the power of the Federal Court in relation to the ordering of a jury trial is constrained to determining issues of fact. He says this makes obvious sense because it has long been established that matters of law are within the repository of a judicial officer. However assuming that there is a question of fact, there would have to be a very good reason for a jury trial to be ordered. Mr Lazarus argues that an application under s.30(3) of the Bankruptcy Act is bound to fail and hence Mr Kelly's application for a transfer should be refused. In support of this contention, Mr Lazarus referred to the decision in Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1403 per Flick J which he submits is the most recent consideration of the issue. The facts of that case were that bankruptcy proceedings were on foot in the Federal Court and an application was made under s.30(3) of the Bankruptcy Act for a jury trial. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1985">A prior Notice of Motion seeking to have the present proceeding heard in this Court with a jury was dismissed: Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1403. An application for leave to appeal that decision has also been dismissed: Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1516. The present Application is thus to be heard by a Judge of this Court, sitting alone. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1516">1 Judgment was entered against Mr Harding in the District Court of New South Wales in favour of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in the sum of $373,772.47. The Deputy Commissioner subsequently served a bankruptcy notice on Mr Harding who then applied to have the bankruptcy notice set aside. That application was docketed to a single judge. Mr Harding then applied to have his application tried before a jury. That latter application was dismissed in a judgment given on 15 September 2008: Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1403. Mr Harding has sought leave to appeal against that judgment and has also applied to have his application for leave heard by a Full Court. This judgment concerns those last mentioned applications.</sentence>
