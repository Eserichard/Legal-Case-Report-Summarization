<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 747">Each has made detailed and helpful written submissions about the Court's powers to convert these proceedings into a class action from the form in which Wingecarribee Council alone had commenced them. In Watson v AWB Limited [2007] FCA 1367 , Gyles J determined that he would follow a number of other decisions by single judges of the Court who had held that there was power under Part IVA to grant leave to amend proceedings, not initially commenced under it, so as to convert them to representative proceedings. This is not an occasion, in light of the position the parties have taken, where it is necessary or desirable to engage in any reconsideration of the course of authority in the Court that has determined that this power exists. </sentence>
