<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 903">Gray J in SBLF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship &amp; Anor (2008) FCA 1219 allowed a review of a Tribunal's decision in part because at the hearing the Tribunal rejected an unsigned letter of the applicant's mother which was generally supportive of his claim. The statement had not been signed nor even checked by the applicant's mother (so it was conceded). His Honour noted that the Tribunal could rely on evidence that was not sworn and was not bound by the rules of evidence. That statement had to be given such weight as it merited and could not be rejected on account of the form in which it came in before the Tribunal. Importantly, his Honour took this to be an index of a failure to carry out the review required by s.414(1) of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1171">The most common point being made is the inconsistency between what was said to the delegate and what is being said to the Tribunal. In the instant case, the applicant concedes, indeed it is part of his submission, that what was said to the delegate was consistent with what was said to the Tribunal. In SBLF v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1219 Gray J considered the function of the Tribunal in conducting a hearing de novo at [38]: "The Tribunal's overall statutory function, pursuant to s 414(1) of the Migration Act was to review the decision of the Minister's delegate. As I have said, that function is to be exercised by means of what is called a hearing de novo, in which the Tribunal must receive information and submissions and make its own decision on the material before it. The Tribunal has a fact-finding function , which it must exercise for this purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 936">If the weight to be given to any particular document or letter is to be affected by reasons other than those previously canvassed during the hearing, it is obviously a far preferable course for those other reasons to be disclosed and an opportunity expressly provided to respond to those reasons. Once such an opportunity has been provided, it is thereafter a matter for the Tribunal alone to give to the evidence before it such weight as it sees fit ( Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 291 to 292 per Kirby J), consistent with its duty to undertake a hearing de novo : ( SBLF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA [2008] FCA 1219 ; 1219 , 103 ALD 566 per Gray J). However, no requirement is imposed upon the Tribunal to allow an applicant an opportunity to comment upon what are essentially its own thought processes ( SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18] , [2007] HCA 26 ; 96 ALD 1 at 8, approving VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 at [24] , [2004] FCAFC 123 ; 206 ALR 471 at 476 to 477 per Finn and Stone JJ; WAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 912 per French J, as His Honour then was, at [36]; Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046, 47 AAR 314. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 402">In SBLF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1219 ; (2008) 103 ALD 566 Gray J observed: 
 There is a clear distinction between making a finding of fact inconsistent with some of the material of a probative nature, after consideration of the whole of the material, and choosing not to rely on some of the material at all. In many, if not most, cases, it will be inevitable that the fact-finder will make findings inconsistent with some of the probative material before him or her. That is the natural result of the process, which involves determining what to accept and what to reject. That process is altogether different from arbitrary rejection of probative material by labelling it as without probative value, or weight, altogether, when it has probative value. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 23">The effect of that section as, as with s.357A of the Act as it applies in respect of reviews before the Migration Review Tribunal, is that the common law natural justice hearing rule is excluded. Notwithstanding the doubt expressed by Gray J in SBLF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1219 at [33], there is now binding Full Court authority to this effect (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat (2006) 151 FCR 214 and SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 62). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 1680">To the extent that some procedural fairness point is also essayed in respect of the Tribunal's failure to give the applicant proper notice of these matters that argument is met by the terms of s.422B of the Act. The effect of that section has been conclusively determined by two separate Full Court decisions, namely, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat (2006) 151 FCR 214 and SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 62 , the doubt expressed by Gray J in SBLF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1219 at [33] notwithstanding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 1307">In any event, the complaint is one about non-compliance with s.359A of the Act. It is not a claim that the applicant was denied procedural fairness on account of the issue of the s.375A Certificate and its consequences. If it were, the argument would be met by the terms of s.357A, which makes it clear that the common law natural justice hearing rule is excluded. Notwithstanding the doubt expressed by Gray J in SBLF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1219 at [33] , there is now binding Full Court authority to this effect (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat (2006) 151 FCR 214 and SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 62). </sentence>
