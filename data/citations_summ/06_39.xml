<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 236">Mr Kumar relied on SZNVE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 251 (" SZNVE "), per Logan J, for the proposition, in particular, that the Tribunal's failure to address the "correct" social group could not be "cured" by the Tribunal simply addressing the issue of a well-founded fear in a general way. (See SZNVE at [27], and the reference to VWBU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 39 at [9] . ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 251">Because this submission was made late and not then fully developed it seemed to me in the interests of justice that the Appellants not then be required immediately to respond to it by way of oral submissions. Rather, I made directions for the filing and service of a supplementary submission on behalf of the Minister with provision then for a submission in reply by the Appellants. In that supplementary submission the Minister pressed the argument already mentioned as to the relevance by analogy of cases concerning the Tribunal's first consideration of relocation. The Appellants in reply noted that a decision principally relied upon by the Minister, Syan v Refugee Review Tribunal (1995) 61 FCR 284 had been decided prior to the Dranichnikov case. Later authority and in particular, VWBU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 39 , underscored, so it was submitted, that a failure on the part of the Tribunal to consider the visa application as made could not be remedied by an independent finding on the part of the Tribunal that the claimed fear was not well founded. </sentence>
