 26 There are two other possible bases for orders in this case. The first is that, in the circumstances of this case, the Court is able to look behind the trust structure and determine that, in reality, the property of the trust is effectively Mr Donovan's property because he effectively controls the power of selection ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 153 FCR 509 at 518 [29] and 520-521 [36]-[39] per French J). The second possible basis is that Mr Donovan has, in the particular circumstances of this case, an expectancy under the Stephen Donovan Family Trust (see Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1967] UKHL 6 ; [1968] AC 553 at 607 per Lord Reid, at 615 per Lord Wilberforce; Hunt v Muollo [2003] 2 NZLR 322 at 325 [11]) and the case falls within Cardile ((i) in the passage quoted above at [15]) or O 25A r 5(5)(a). As these possibilities were not the subject of detailed submissions by counsel, I do no more than identify them as a possible basis for the freezing orders against the third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] NSWSC 164">Mr Stack notes that in ASIC v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 141 , French J (as his Honour then was) said, at [29], that this "definition and its various elements should not ... be narrowly construed". 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] VCAT 1278">A discretionary trust, she said, was one where the entitlement of beneficiaries to income or to corpus or both is not immediately ascertainable but that beneficiaries are selected from a nominated class by the trustee or some other person with the power being exercisable from time to time. She submitted that a superannuation trust was a fixed trust. She referred to the judgment of French J as he then was in ASIC v Carey (No. 6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 233 ALR 475. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] MRTA 433">On 10 June 2009, the Tribunal was provided a copy of an article which appears to have appeared in an accountancy journal or seminar about the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No. 6) [2006] FCA 814. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCAFC 112">118 More particularly, there is advanced in the manual and adopted by the Minister in his submissions the notion that demonstrating "complete and effective control over the trust income and assets" of a discretionary trust can be sufficient to confer an "ownership interest". Having regard to the definition and to Gartside's case, this is a considerable and unwarranted extension of the language employed in the definition. Notions of the effective control of a discretionary trust such as described by French J (as the Chief Justice then was) in Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; ASIC v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 153 FCR 509 at 520-521 [36] and [37] are foreign to the definition of "ownership interest" as it stands. As that definition stands, even had Ms Hart held a majority of the shares in Northside and been the "Principal" in respect of the Yates Family Trust, her interest in its business would nonetheless have been nothing more than an expectancy. I note further that, in Re Richstar Enterprises , after a wide ranging survey of authority, including Gartside's case, French J (at [37]) described such a position no higher than "something approaching ... the ownership of the trust property".
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 915">It is convenient to set out the following features which formed a background to the proceeding as at 30 June 2009: Mr JA Halley SC and Ms RL Doland appeared for ASIC, Mr AG Hartnell, solicitor, appeared for Mr Groves, Mr AP Spencer of counsel appeared for Ms Collins-Rubie, and Ms ST Chrysanthou of counsel appeared for Mr Zullo; Mr Groves and Ms Collins-Rubie are husband and wife; Mr Zullo is Mr Groves's brother-in-law; Mr Groves was the beneficial owner of the sole share in the capital of Perfection Too and Ms Collins-Rubie was its sole director; On or about 18 May 2009, Ms Collins-Rubie signed a contract for sale of the Currumbin Property to Mr Zullo. I was informed on the hearing on 30 June that the property was transferred to Mr Zullo. Nonetheless, Mr Groves, Ms Collins-Rubie and their children continued to reside in it; as at an earlier time when they were not married, Mr Groves and Ms Collins-Rubie resided in a house at 71 Jefferson Lane, Palm Beach, Queensland (the Palm Beach property) which, on or about 30 March 2009, Perfection Too had transferred to Ms Collins-Rubie; the Trust is a discretionary trust, the potential beneficiaries under which are Mr Groves, Ms Collins-Rubie and Mr Groves's two daughters; ASIC's case was to be that for the purposes of s 1323 the aggrieved persons would be or include creditors and shareholders of ABC, and that at least the first two defendants were "relevant persons" for the purposes of that section because they were or might be or become liable to pay money to those creditors under various provisions of the Corporations Act (reference was made to ss 180 , 181 , 182 , 183 , 184 , 208 , 209 , 344 , 596 , 1041E , 1308 and 1309 ); it was foreshadowed that on the hearing a major issue would be whether the property held by Perfection Too as trustee of the Trust constituted property "of" Mr Groves for the purposes of s 1323 (ASIC said that it proposed to rely on Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 153 FCR 509 (French J, as his Honour then was) and to contend that Perfection Too and the Trust were the alter ego of Mr Groves); Mr Spencer emphasised that Perfection Too had not been joined as a defendant even though orders were sought that affected the potential beneficiaries of the Trust; Mr Halley SC explained that the view had been taken that the only appropriate defendants were persons who were "relevant persons" within s 1323 , which Perfection Too was not, but that if Perfection Too was the alter ego of Mr Groves it should be possible for the Court to appoint a receiver of the property it held as trustee of the Trust without its being a defendant, and if it was not his alter ego ASIC would not be entitled to any relief in respect of the Trust property; Mr Halley SC said that the only involvement of Ms Collins-Rubie was in relation to the Palm Beach property and her involvement with the Trust generally. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCAFC 37">17 The primary judge then reviewed several cases relied on by the Elliotts as to the meaning of beneficial interests in a discretionary trust: [35] --- [39] and [41] --- [46]. According to her Honour, four of the cases ( Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1967] UKHL 6 ; [1968] AC 553 , R &amp; I Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Anchorage Investments Pty Ltd (1993) 10 WAR 59 , Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey &amp; Ors (No 6 ) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 153 FCR 509 and Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) v Livingston (1964) 112 CLR 12) 'make it plain that, although the object of a discretionary trust holds a bundle of rights, these rights do not necessarily amount to what can be termed an "interest" or "beneficial interest", when considered from the perspective of a particular statute': [46]. 24 On the other hand, if the trust falls within (3), and certainly if it falls within (4), it will not be possible to measure the collective interests of all existing members of the class for the reason that the power to accumulate might be exercised. This is not to say that the members of the class have no rights; as French J said in Carey [2006] FCA 814 ; 153 FCR 509 at [30] :
 I accept that there are some rights enjoyed, even by the beneficiaries of a non-exhaustive discretionary trust with an open class of beneficiaries. They include the right to inspect the trust documents --- Re Londonderry's Settlement [1965] Ch 918 and the right to require the trustee to provide information about management of the trust fund --- Spellson v George (1987) 11 NSWLR 300 ; Hartigan Nominees Pty Ltd v Rydge (1992) 29 NSWLR 405. There is also a right to enforce the proper management of the trust by the trustee: Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) v Livingston (1964) 112 CLR 12 ; Re Atkinson [1971] VicRp 73 ; [1971] VR 612. But those rights are not, in any relevant sense, capable of measurement.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] HCA 56">The wife was an eligible object of benefaction of the Trust. She was one of the class of "beneficiaries" identified in cl 4 of the 1981 Instrument. The use in that document of the term "beneficiaries" was inapt insofar as it suggested the existence of any vested beneficial interest in the assets held on the trust of the 1981 Instrument. Dr Hardingham correctly identified the wife as one of the class of objects of the discretionary power conferred upon the trustee by cl 6 of the 1981 Instrument. She also was one of the class of objects for division of the fund at the distribution date (cl 7). Furthermore, as an object of these powers the wife had a right in equity to due administration of the Trust [72] . The existence of such a right did not depend upon entitlement to any fixed and transmissible beneficial interest in the trust fund [73] . The right of the wife was accompanied at least by a fiduciary duty on the part of the trustee, the husband, to consider whether and in what way he should exercise the power conferred by cl 6 [74] .
  The phrase in par (ca) "with respect to the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them" should be read in a fashion which advances rather than constrains the subject, scope and purpose of the legislation. In particular, as statements by this Court [45] illustrate, the term "property" is not a term of art with one specific and precise meaning. It is always necessary to pay close attention to any statutory context in which the term is used [46] . In particular it is, of course, necessary to have regard to the subject matter, scope and purpose of the relevant statute.

 Were it otherwise, it is obvious that a party could, by simply acquiring or placing assets in a discretionary family trust, effectively avoid an order being made which would enable the other party to share in the property owned by the trust. The jurisprudence on this issue is not limited to Family Court authority. In Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd &amp; Ors; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Carey and Ors (No.6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2007) 233 ALR 475 ; (2006) 153 FCR 509 , French J had to consider whether the Court had power under s 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to appoint a receiver to property held by a third party on a trust, whether discretionary or otherwise, of which the relevant person was a beneficiary. French J noted (at page ALR 480) that in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Vegners (1989) 90 ALR 547 , Gummow J at page 552 described the power of the trustee in a discretionary trust as a "special or hybrid power" and said: 
 [A] power exercisable in favour of any person including the donee of the power would be a general power and thus would be tantamount to ownership of the property concerned.... 
 French J said at page 481: 
 At least by analogy it may be observed that a beneficiary who effectively controls the trustee of a discretionary trust may have what approaches a general power and thus a proprietary interest in the income and corpus of the trust. 
 I agree with the comments of the Full Court in Webster (supra), particularly that each case must be determined on its own facts"

<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] NSWSC 996">96 Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the assets of the Farr Better Trust formed part of the estate and should be included in the provision made for the plaintiff by way of her receiving the whole of the estate. I have rejected the plaintiff's claim to the whole of the estate. In any event, I do not accept that the assets of the Farr Better Trust are assets of the estate. The basis for that contention was that through Mr Farr's control of Fasthaven as trustee and pursuant to the powers given to him under the trust deed, he controlled the assets of the Farr Better Trust during his lifetime. It was submitted that by reason of that control, the assets of the trust were "in reality" his assets. Counsel referred to and relied on Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No. 6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 153 FCR 509. I dealt with the same argument in Public Trustee v Smith [2008] NSWSC 397 at [104] - [139]. For the reasons there given I reject the submission that the assets of the Farr Better Trust are assets of the estate because of the control which Mr Farr exercised over the trust during his lifetime. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FCA 1293">9 The reasoning of the Tribunal appears in the following two paragraphs:
 
 The [Elliotts] say they do not fit within s 1207V(2)(d) because --- as beneficiaries under a discretionary trust --- they do not have any beneficial interest in the income or corpus of the trust. They referred to a number of authorities for this proposition, including Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Buckle [1998] HCA 4 ; (1998) 192 CLR 226 and Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1967] UKHL 6 ; [1968] AC 553 ; see also R &amp; I Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Anchorage Investments Pty Ltd (1992) 10 WAR 59 at 79 per Owen J and Australian Securities Investments Commission; In the matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 at para 28 per French J. 
 
 The [Secretary] say [s] the words of the section change whatever the position might be at general law. Mr Belcher argued use of the word aggregate 'requires consideration of what the combined beneficial interest of the beneficiaries would be as if they were collected or united into one'. 17 The Elliotts argued that, under the trust created by clause 5(b), until the trustees exercised their discretion to make payment out of the trust fund to them, they have merely a right to invoke the equitable jurisdiction of a court to ensure that the trust is duly administered and that the trustees exercise their discretion properly. It followed, so they said, that they could not affect the outcome of the trustees' decision-making process in order to secure the payment of trust funds to themselves. In this circumstance, so they submitted, neither they nor their daughter (or any other discretionary beneficiary) could hold a beneficial interest in the corpus or income of the trust within the meaning of par 1207V(2)(d). Accordingly, so they contended, they could not satisfy par (d) of subs 1207V(2) since none of the discretionary beneficiaries held a beneficial interest capable of being aggregated. Counsel for the Elliotts supported this argument by reference to such authorities as Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1967] UKHL 6 ; [1968] AC 553 ( "Gartside" ), R &amp; I Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Anchorage Investments Pty Ltd (1993) 10 WAR 59 (" Anchorage ") and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 153 FCR 509 (" Carey "). </sentence>

 1 MASTER SANDERSON : On 21 December 2007, the plaintiffs, in their capacities as beneficiaries of the Murdoch Family Trust (the Trust), commenced these proceedings seeking orders compelling the trustee of the Trust to make certain documents relating to the assets of the Trust available to them for inspection. The terms of the Trust deed confer upon the defendant complete discretion whether to distribute any part of the income or capital forming part of the Trust at any time to the plaintiffs. It was common ground that as discretionary beneficiaries in a non-exhaustive trust, the plaintiffs have no proprietary interest. They have nothing more than a hope that they might be considered by the trustee for a distribution: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814. </sentence>

 JUDGMENT 
 

 Introduction 
 

1 HIS HONOUR : Dr Helen Ward died on 26 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FCA 461">There is nothing in the reasoning of French J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 153 FCR 509 which doubts these principles in relation to the nature of interests in or under a discretionary trust. French J was concerned with the content and extent of a contingent interest for the purposes of s 9 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2007] NSWSC 1217">In contending that assets of the three trusts are "property of" Mr Burnard, ASIC relied on a number of observations of French J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 141.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2007] FamCA 680">45. The jurisprudence on this issue is not limited to Family Court authority. In Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd &amp; Ors; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Carey and Ors (No.6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2007) 233 ALR 475 ; (2006) 153 FCR 509 , French J had to consider whether the Court had power under s 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to appoint a receiver to property held by a third party on a trust, whether discretionary or otherwise, of which the relevant person was a beneficiary.</sentence>

18 On 28 June 2006 orders were made giving liberty to ASIC to apply for variations to the receiver orders allowing them, inter alia, to extend the application of the individual receiver orders to trust property held under trusts in respect of which the defendants were beneficiaries including discretionary trusts of which a defendant had effective control: Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 153 FCR 509. </sentence>

 15. The respondents say they do not fit within s 1207V(2)(d) because --- as beneficiaries under a discretionary trust - they do not have any beneficial interest in the income or corpus of the trust.
