<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 924">For s 15(2)(d) to operate the employee needs to establish that he or she has suffered some detriment in the sense of some sort of disadvantage which is more than trivial. Whether that employee has suffered any detriment is to be answered objectively: O'Callaghan v Loader (1983) 3 NSWLR 89. That decision, which was a decision of Matthews DCJ, as she then was, as Chair of the Equal Opportunity Tribunal, was followed by Graham J in Varas v Fairfield City Council [2009] FCA 689 , a decision from which special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWADT 99">30. Further, the Respondent does not concede that it 'imputed' a disability to the Applicant within the meaning of s 49A(b) of the Act. The Respondent denies that it presumed the Applicant had a disability or implied that the Applicant had a disability: see Zhang v University of Tasmania [2OO91 FCXAFC35; Varas v Fairfield Council [20083] FMCA 996 and on appeal [2009] FCA 689. 31. At all relevant times, the Respondent submits that it was not concerned with whether the Applicant had a disability or not, but rather, whether the Applicant submitted to a medical test and provided sufficient information to it regarding her fitness to drive.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWADT 312">60 The respondent also submitted that to be denied the return to work because of the risks of re-injury could never amount to a detriment and referred to the decision in O'Callaghan v Loder [1983] 3 NSWLR 89 which in turn was referred to in Varas v Fairfield City Council [2009] FCA 689 , in which Justice Graham stated in relation to the meaning of "detriment"
 

 
 
 In O'Callaghan the Tribunal was concerned to ascertain what was meant by 'subjecting ... to any other detriment' within the meaning of s 25(2)(c) of the Anti-Discrimination Act . Mathews DCJ, as her Honour then was, considered that the Tribunal should adopt the meaning ascribed to the word 'detriment' by Brandon LJ in Ministry of Defence v Jeremiah [1980] QB 87 at 99 where his Lordship said:
 'I do not regard the expression "subjecting ... to any other detriment" ... as meaning anything more than 'putting under a disadvantage'. ' 
 


 
 
 Mathews DCJ said in O'Callaghan at 105:
 'The disadvantage must be a matter of substance; the legislation [referring to s 25(2)(c) of the Anti-Discrimination Act ] is not directed to trivial distinctions in the treatment afforded to men and women. Subject to that, it is difficult to define the limits of a concept which is ... essentially a matter of fact to be determined in each individual case. ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] NSWADT 266">A reliable psychiatric assessment was reasonably required for the Council to decide upon further action. I find, on this basis, that although the Council's directions for Ms Varas to attend Dr Korner were because the Council had imputed to her a histrionic personality disorder (and hypochondriasis) the requests were reasonable in the circumstances and did not constitute a detriment for the purposes of the DDA. 
 


That finding was not disturbed on appeal: Varas v Fairfield City Council [2009] FCA 689. Tone or manner. In Damiano v Wilkinson [2004] FMCA 891 at [24] , Baumann FM held that being shouted at on the phone was a trivial matter and did not come within the meaning of a detriment in relation to the victimisation provision under the DD Act .</sentence>
