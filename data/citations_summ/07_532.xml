<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1042">In Boensch v Pascoe [2007] FCA 532 privileged documents were inadvertently tendered by counsel. When the error was appreciated a claim for privilege was asserted but not accepted by a Federal Magistrate. On appeal Jacobson J took a different view. His Honour said (at [37]-[39]): It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether or to what extent the provisions of s 122 of the Evidence Act dealing with the circumstances in which privilege may be lost correspond with the common law principles; see Mann v Carnell at [23]; see also Van Zonneveld v Seaton [2004] NSWSC 960 at [11] (per Campbell J). It seems to me that on either approach, what is required is a voluntary act which is inconsistent with the purpose of maintaining confidentiality. An inadvertent or unintentional act will not be sufficient to amount to waiver. 
 Of course, "a mere plea" of inadvertence may not by itself necessarily enable a party to avoid a waiver of privilege; Hooker Corporation Ltd v Darling Harbour Authority (1987) 9 NSWLR 538 at 542-543. Thus, the Court must be satisfied on the material before it that the act was in truth inadvertent.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FamCA 644">At issue is whether the accidental failure, on the part of the husband's solicitor, to be present at Court when the subject subpoena was called for, coupled with the resulting inspection of the file before the Court order granting leave was revoked, creates a waiver of legal professional privilege in relation to the Meyer Pigdon file. Further, does the inspection of the file by the wife's counsel in recent time give rise to waiver of the privilege even though the order for inspection had been revoked and inspection was enabled only by an omission on the part of a court officer. In an unreported judgment of the Federal Court of Australia, Boensch v Pascoe [2007] FCA 532 , Justice Jacobson considered the issue of whether documents tendered by counsel, and forming part of an exhibit, were as a result of error and inadvertence and whether their delivery constituted a waiver of privilege. The Federal Magistrate at first instance determined that the tender was deliberate with counsel having "specifically eschewed" any suggestion of inadvertence in the tender (at paragraph 2). The appellant submitted that, upon a proper application of Mann v Carnell (1999) (supra), there was no implied or accidental waiver of privilege in the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1081">Loss of client legal privilege for relevant purposes is governed by s 122 of the Act. Section 122(2) involves a party knowingly and voluntarily disclosing to another person the substance of the evidence. Section 122(4) deals with the substance of the evidence having been disclosed with the express or implied consent of the party to another person. Counsel for the applicant submitted that I should follow the decision of Jacobson J in Boensch v Pascoe [2007] FCA 532 where his Honour held (at [38]): 
 
 "An inadvertent or unintentional act will not be sufficient to amount to waiver. " 
 

I would normally follow such a recent and considered decision of a judge of the Court. However, the other authorities to which I was referred by counsel drew attention to the decision of Goldberg J in Meltend Pty Ltd v Restoration Clinics of Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 75 FCR 511 , to which Jacobson J was apparently not referred, in which Goldberg J made a detailed analysis of the statutory provisions and the authorities and concluded that mere inadvertence or unintentional disclosure in itself is not sufficient to maintain privilege particularly where documents have been inspected.
