<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 17">Nor is it apparent from the reasons for judgment why the primary judge determined that the appellant's conduct "warrants nothing less than a sentence of imprisonment": at [45]. It seems to me that the primary judge was clearly of the view that the appellant's conduct was deserving of imprisonment, but for the reasons I have already alluded to, the appropriate question is whether in all of the circumstances no other sentence was appropriate. There is no consideration in the primary judge's reasons as to why punishment by way of substantial fines would not have been appropriate in the circumstances. If the appellant's impecuniosity was the reason, as Lander J said in Jones v Toben (No 2) [2009] FCA 477 at [83] : 
 
 Impecuniosity could not be a reason to imprison a person when the appropriate penalty would otherwise be a fine. 
 

  I would not disturb the costs order made in the Court below. I would not make any order as to the costs of the appeal particularly as the appellant has succeeded, in part at least, by reference to an argument which was not put in the Court below. I certify that the preceding seventy-six (76) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko. Associate:

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 650">The Court has an unfettered discretion in determining whether and on what basis to award costs: see Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 ; Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA 14 ; (2007) 228 CLR 651. It is common for costs to be awarded in favour of a successful Applicant in contempt proceedings: see BHP Steel at 351; Rip Curl International Pty Ltd v Phone Lab Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1215 ; (2004) 63 IPR 496. Courts, however, have awarded costs on a party and party basis (see: for example, Jones v Toben (No 2 ) [2009] FCA 477) and on an indemnity basis (see: for example, BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2002] FCA 702). The reason that indemnity costs are frequently awarded where an applicant has successfully prosecuted charges of contempt is that the applicant has not been seeking any remedy on its own behalf but rather has been upholding the various public interests which are served by prosecutions for contempt of Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 585">I do not propose to set out any further details of the factual background of this matter. It is fully set out in the primary judge's reasons for finding the applicant guilty of contempt ( Jones v Toben [2009] FCA 354) and on penalty ( Jones v Toben (No 2) [2009] FCA 477). </sentence>
