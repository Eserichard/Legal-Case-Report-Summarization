<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] NSWSC 646">48 Certain (revenue) consequences arising from the service of a s.63 notice were considered by Finn J in R &amp; D Holdings Pty Limited v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 981 at [157] - [159], [172] and, on appeal, by the Full Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation v R &amp; D Holdings Pty Limited [2007] FCAFC 107 ; (2007) 240 ALR 653 at 663 [55] - [62], 670-673 [96]-[102]. In the latter case, Stone J at 671 [96] observed that the ambit of a mortgagee's rights is circumscribed by the fact that those rights are limited to the vindication of its security, and that the mortgagee is not entitled to ignore the mortgagor's interest where protection of that interest is compatible with its right to protect or realise its security. As to s.63 generally, see Tyler Young and Croft, "Fisher and Lightwood's Law of Mortgage" 2nd Australian edn, 2005 at 445-447; Croft and Johannsson, "The Mortgagee's Power of Sale" , 2nd edn, 2004 at 64-66; Duncan and Dixon, "The Law of Real Property Mortgages" , 2007 at 94; Sackville and Neave, "Australian Property Law" , 8th edn, 2008, at 1165-1168.</sentence>
