<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 93">An extension of time may be granted where an applicant can establish " special reasons ": Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) O 52 r 15(2). The discretion to extend time is given for the purpose of enabling the Court to do justice between the parties: WAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399 at [7] ; Applicant S1138 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1052 at [11] ; SZKJV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 831 at [10] . An applicant, it has been said, must advance a reason to take " the case out of the ordinary ": Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195. The rule confers " a flexible discretionary power ": (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195. Even where " special reasons " can be established, the Court thus retains a discretion to grant or refuse the extension sought: Kordatos v Sweeney [2004] FCA 1487 at [17] per Cooper J. So much is apparent from the terms of r 15(2) itself --- "... the Court or a Judge for special reasons may at any time... ".  Of relevance to the exercise of the discretion, but never conclusive, is the fact that many applicants seeking to challenge adverse decisions made under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) are not fluent in English and frequently are not represented by legal advisers: cf Vranic v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2004] FCA 1511. And when represented by (for example) counsel appearing on a pro bono basis, the Court is considerably benefited: SZKJV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 831 at [13] to [14]. Also of relevance, but again not conclusive, may be the financial circumstances confronting an applicant: cf QAAH v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 9 at [7] ; SZKDC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 164 at [12] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1093">25 I interpolate that the competing injustice or prejudice caused to the parties has been stated as an important consideration in a number of decisions including: WAAD (see [23] above), SZKJV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 831 (' SZKJV') at [12] per Jacobson J and Jackamarra v Krakouer [1998] HCA 27 ; (1998) 195 CLR 516 (' Jackamarra ') at [66.4] per Kirby J. Further, another aspect that has some bearing on the issue is whether the respondent's substantive rights are put at risk by the grant of leave: see Jackamarra at [7] per Brennan CJ and McHugh J.</sentence>
