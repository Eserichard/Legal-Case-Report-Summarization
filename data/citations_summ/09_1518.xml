 5. Liberty to apply. 
 

 
My reasons for making these orders are set out in Procter v Kalivis [2009] FCA 1518. On 25 February 2010, the respondents filed a Further Amended List of Documents verified by affidavits of all respondents. The applicants pressed their application in paragraph 1 of the notice of motion for leave to cross examine the respondents in relation to the Further Amended List of Documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 1225">


 
31 The plaintiff's senior counsel accepted that it was exceptional to permit cross examination of the deponent to an affidavit verifying discovery. Nevertheless, it was submitted that this was a case where, exceptionally, such an order should be made. The plaintiff relied upon Procter v Kalivis [2009] FCA 1518 , (2009) 263 ALR461 where Besanko J held that cross examination of a deponent on an affidavit sworn in response to an order for discovery is in fact allowed:
 

 
(a) in certain circumstances where the discovery has been insufficient;
 

 
 
 (b) where there are reasonable grounds for being fairly certain that there are other relevant documents; 
 


 
 
 (c) where the evidence raises doubts as to whether the process of the court is being abused in relation to discovery or there are serious questions as to the legitimacy of the position taken by the defendants in relation to discovery; and 
 


 
 
 (d) where there is no effective means other than cross examination of preventing an injustice to the applicants. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 663">In my previous decision in this proceeding, I set out the relevant principles as to the circumstances in which an affidavit of a discovery may be challenged and the circumstances in which a party may be granted leave to cross-examine on an affidavit of discovery: Procter v Kalivis [2009] FCA 1518 ; (2009) 263 ALR 461 at 467-469 [29] - [40]. I will not repeat what I said about those principles. In the ordinary case, the affidavit of discovery is conclusive: Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341 at 343 per Menzies J. Cross-examination will be allowed only in very limited circumstances. In my opinion, this is not a case in which cross-examination on the affidavits of discovery should be allowed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1517">The applicants' application was refined as the submissions proceeded. The applicants accepted that, at this stage, they could not press for an order for cross-examination of the first, third and fourth respondents. That concession was correctly made and I refer generally to my discussion of the circumstances in which cross-examination may be ordered in Procter v Kalivis [2009] FCA 1518 at [35] - [41]. </sentence>
