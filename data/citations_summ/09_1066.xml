<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] VSC 510">[1] 
57 TGG submits that the banks take their rights subject to the growers' rights under the 2005-2007 schemes because: 
(a) the growers are tenants in possession under s 42(2)(e) of the Transfer of Land Act 1958 (Vic); 
(b) they have been granted a sub-lease of the almond lots as defined in the sub-leases. The almond lots include 'the Almond Trees, the Capital Works and the Water Licences attributable to the Project'. TGG submits that clause 2.2(a) of the sub-lease should be read down to only include a reservation to Almond Land of the reversion in those assets; 
(c) if the sub-lease has been terminated, they have rights to seek an order for relief against forfeiture under s 146(4) of the Property Law Act 1958 (Vic); 
(d) the sub-leases will survive the surrender or merger of the head lease into the freehold under s 139 of the Property Law Act 1958 (Vic); 
(e) if the liquidators were to disclaim the head leases, then the head leases will merge into the freehold and their sub-leases survive the disclaimer under s 139 of the Property Law Act 1958 (Vic); [2] 
(f) alternatively, the growers can apply to have the disclaimer set aside under s 568B; 
(g) the water rights, capital works and almond trees form appurtenances to the head leases and sub-leases necessary and convenient for the almond lot operations permitted by clause 8.1 and required by clause 8.2 and any interference with them by the mortgagee constitutes a derogation from the grant; [3] and 
(h) the head leases contain clauses to the following effect (clause 9.3): 
 
 
 Upon this Lease terminating for whatever reason, the Lessor irrevocably authorises and consents to the granting or continuation (or both) by the Growers of a right to occupy or use the Land granted under the Sub-leases (Wangera), on the same terms and conditions as the Growers are granted sub-leases, whether before or after the execution of this Lease, and with the Lessor accepting the obligations of the Lessee to the Growers under Sub-leases (Wangera). (i) TSL is the responsible entity and holds the interest in the lease on trust for the growers (s 601FC(2) of the Corporations Act ). TGG submits that it is obliged to act on its rights under clause 9.3 to ensure that a lease will be granted to the growers if the head lease is terminated. It uses a discounted cash flow method which is not appropriate in these circumstances. The report is not a determination of the market value of the growers rights, but a report to apportion part of the purchase price to the growers. A discounted cash flow cannot achieve this; 
(h) it recognises the following concession by the liquidators' legal advisers: [7] 
 
 
 ...the Arnold Block Leibler Advice recognises the existence of some difficult legal issues and concludes that the legal uncertainties provide some scope for argument on the part of the Growers; 
 
 
 (i) it recognises that ABL's advice relies heavily on the assumption that the growers' interests can be disclaimed and expresses reservations about the correctness of that view in light of advice from Carson's advisors; [8] 
(j) the liquidators cannot disclaim the growers' rights because: 
(i) if the liquidators were to disclaim the head lease, the head lease would merge into the freehold [9] and the sub-leases would survive under s 139 of the Property Law Act 1958 (Vic); 
(ii) the licence and joint venture agreements have an unusual structure in which the landowner leases the land to TSL, who sub-leases it back to the landowner. The landowner then grants the licence to the grower. [10] Disclaimer of the lease or the sub-lease in the 2002 schemes would not affect the licence granted by the landowner to the growers; and 
(iii) TSL is the responsible entity of the schemes and the powers in the constitution must be exercised for the benefit of the growers; 
(k) it records that the Arnold Block Leibler advice notes that the growers' interests are presently liable to be terminated for default.</sentence>
