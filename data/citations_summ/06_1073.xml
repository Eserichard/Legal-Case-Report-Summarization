<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] WASC 297">107 In assessing solvency, the court acts generally upon the basis that a contract debt is payable at the time stipulated for payment in the contract absent proof of an express or implied agreement extending the time for payment, or an estoppel preventing the creditor from relying on the stipulated time for payment, or a well established and well recognised course of conduct in the industry in which the company operates, or between the company and its creditors as a whole, whereby debts are payable at a time other than that stipulated in the creditor's terms of trade or are payable only on demand: Southern Cross Interiors v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (225); Travers (as liquidator of Askernish Pty Ltd (in liq)) v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1073 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 472 [25]; White Constructions (ACT) Pty Ltd (in liq) v White [2004] NSWSC 71 ; (2004) 49 ACSR 220 [291]; Sutherland &amp; Anor (as joint liquidators of Australian Coal Technology) v Hanson Construction Materials Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 232 ; (2009) 254 ALR 650 [12].</sentence>

44 It is, of course, clear that the question whether a company is insolvent is a question of fact: see, for example, Lewis (as liquidator of Doran Constructions Pty Ltd) (above) at p.434 ([109]); Travers v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1073 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 472 at p.479 ([39]).</sentence>
