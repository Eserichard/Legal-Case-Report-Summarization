<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 107">Upon the non-appearance of the Appellant, an application was made by Counsel on behalf of the First Respondent to have the appeal dismissed pursuant to s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Rather than dismissing the appeal, it was considered that the more appropriate course was to proceed to hear the appeal in the absence of the Appellant. Such a course is permitted by O 52 r 38A(1)(d) of the Federal Court Rules . Rule 38A provides the following: 
 
 Absence of party 
 (1) If a party is absent when an appeal is called on for hearing, the Court may: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) order that the hearing not proceed unless the appeal is again set down for hearing or such other steps are taken as the Court directs; or 
 (b) adjourn the hearing; or 
 (d) proceed with the hearing, either generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the appeal. 
 
 
 
 
 (2) If the Court proceeds with the hearing under paragraph (1) (d), the Court may: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) set aside or vary any order made after so proceeding; and 
 (b) give directions for the further conduct of the appeal. 
 
 

Adopting such a course at least ensures that the substance of the appeal has been addressed, albeit without the assistance of the appellant. It is a course which has previously been invoked in the hearing of migration appeals: See, eg, Nadezhkin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 128 at [19] to [20]; SZASL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1697 at [6] ; VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 at [2] , [2004] FCAFC 123 ; 206 ALR 471 at 472 per Finn and Stone JJ; SZLQW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1279 at [3] to [4]. </sentence>
