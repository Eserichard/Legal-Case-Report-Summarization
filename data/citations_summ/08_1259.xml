<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 217">As noted by Brennan J, when he was President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 2 ALD 634 at 639: 
 Inconsistency is not merely inelegant: it brings the process of deciding into disrepute, suggesting an arbitrariness which is incompatible with commonly accepted notions of justice. 

 
This passage has, not surprisingly, been repeatedly cited: e.g. Apthorpe v Repatriation Commission (1987) 13 ALD 656 at 665 per Davies, Lockhart and Gummow JJ; Pepaj v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (unreported, FCA, Merkel J, SG 101 of 1998, 25 November 1998); Re Confidential and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2005] AATA 1264 at [22] , [2005] AATA 1264 ; 91 ALD 435 at 439; SZFYW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1259 at [11] . After citing the passage from the judgment of Brennan J, French J (as he then was) observed that "... decision-makers can be consistently wrong or consistently unjust ... ": Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift [1989] FCA 413 ; (1989) 18 ALD 679 at 692. </sentence>
