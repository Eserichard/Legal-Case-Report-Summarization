 QBE INSURANCE LTD v NGUYEN 
 [2008] SASC 138 
 
 
 
 Full Court: Doyle CJ, Gray and Layton JJ 
 
 DOYLE CJ: Mr Nguyen sued QBE Insurance Ltd ("QBE"). He claimed a declaration that, as assignee of the right of Mr Hiotis to indemnity under a public liability insurance policy issued by QBE ("the policy"), he was entitled to payment by QBE of an amount of $2,823,700 ("the damages"). QBE submitted that an insurer had the right to challenge whether an insured's liability to the third party was within the scope of a contract of insurance, whatever may be stated in a judgment or award. [26] It was contended that the Judge erred when he treated the judgments in the earlier proceedings as conclusive of Mr Hiotis' legal liability to the plaintiff for the purposes of engaging the insuring clause under the contract of insurance. QBE submitted that the Judge erred in equating a default judgment with a judgment on the merits. It was contended that the default judgment should not have been used by the trial Judge to bind the insurer to the factual allegations raised in the pleadings when it was neither a party to the action in which the default judgment was obtained and where there had been no adjudication on the merits. The Judge, it was said, ought to have found that the plaintiff, as the assignee of the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy of Mr Hiotis, was required to establish that Mr Hiotis was "actually liable" to him. </sentence>
