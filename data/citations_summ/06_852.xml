<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 521">In Hall v Warner the Federal Court succinctly set out the circumstances in which the Federal Court or this Court may grant leave under s.58(3)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act , namely: "... if it considers that the issues would be better and more comprehensively dealt with by a contested trial of the action in the Supreme Court than would be the case if the applicants were required to lodge a proof of debt in respect of the bankrupt estate. " [17] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 1367">7. The authors of Australian Bankruptcy Law and Practice say that: 
 
 
 "The court has power to grant an order "nunc pro tunc" (now for then) under this subsection, giving leave to commence and continue an action where proceedings have already been commenced against the bankrupt without knowledge of the bankruptcy . " [10] </sentence>
