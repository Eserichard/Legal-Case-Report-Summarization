<citphrase id="cp20.15" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">migration act 1958 (cth), ss 6 , 6a. in an application for review of a decision of the minister for immigration and ethnic affairs made in 1984 refusing an application for a permanent entry permit to an applicant who was the spouse of a permanent resident on the basis that the applicant's marriage had been assessed as being one where the parties did not genuinely intend to continue living as a married couple in australia, it being the minister's policy to refuse permanent entry permits in such cases.  held: (1) that relevant considerations which should have been taken into account were not, thus making the minister's decision invalid pursuant to s 5(2)(b) of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (the act), such considerations being:  (i) a report made in 1981 by an interviewing officer in suva expressing an opinion that the marriage relationship was genuine, such report being part of the history of the relationship, all of which was relevant in determining the quality of the marriage as at the date of the minister deciding the application. although the report was not presented to the minister, it was on the departmental file and was accordingly to be regarded as being constructively before him.  peko-wallsend ltd v. minister for aboriginal affairs (1985) 59 alr 51 , referred to.  (ii) statutory declarations of neighbours and acquaintances as to the applicant leading a normal married life and a letter of a social worker as to the applicant's wife living at home with the applicant, such documents being available to the minister, but there being nothing to indicate that he had taken any account of them.  (2) that in determining whether an administrative decision made under statutory authority falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp20.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 972">Ms Mitchelmore submitted that provided that the Tribunal complies with the procedures set out in the Migration Act for the provision of notices to an applicant, the applicant cannot complain that he or she has not been accorded procedural fairness (see VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (20040 [2004] FCAFC 134 ; 136 FCR 407 at [15] - [16]; NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184 at [16] ; SZEYH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 93). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 687">19 The applicant submitted that he was unaware of the time limits for seeking judicial review of the Tribunal's decision and says that he relied upon his migration agent. The applicant, however, does not make a claim of procedural unfairness due to the conduct of his migration agent. The issue of default by a migration agent was considered in SZFOG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1170. The Court in that case noted the decision of Dowsett J in B41 of 2003, in the matter of an application for a Writ of Mandamus, Prohibition and Certiorari against Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 30. His Honour found that failures by a migration agent could not constitute a failure of the Tribunal in its obligation to afford an applicant procedural fairness. Numerous authorities were cited in support of this proposition: see NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184 ; SZEYH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Another [2006] FCA 93 ; (2006) 150 FCR 397 ; Al-Mehdawi v Secretary of State for the Home Departme nt [1990] 1 AC 876. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1517">However the passage in question was not directly supportive of the outcome in Al-Mehdawi . I also note that his Honour there observed that: 'Procedural unfairness can occur without any personal fault on the part of the decision-maker. ' 

See also SZEYH v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 93 at [30] - [31] per Jacobsen J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCAFC 142">Is there any principle which can be invoked to lead to a different conclusion where the issue is one of public law and where the decision taken is of an administrative character rather than the resolution of a lis inter partes? I cannot discover any such principle and none has been suggested in the course of argument. ' 
 
 
 See also SZEYH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ('SZEYH') [2006] FCA 93 ; (2006) 150 FCR 397 at [21] --- [25] and [30]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 1170">32 The principle enunciated by Dowsett J was clearly correct, and is supported by numerous other authorities: see NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184 ; SZEYH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Anor [2006] FCA 93 ; (2006) 150 FCR 397 ; Al-Mehdawi v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1990] 1 AC 876. For an allegation of procedural unfairness to be made out, it will usually be the case that fault must be established on the part of the decision-maker (although I note the observations of Gleeson CJ in Hot Holdings Pty Ltd v Creasy and Ors [2002] HCA 51 ; (2002) 210 CLR 438 at [22] where his Honour observed that procedural fairness can occur without any personal fault on the part of the decision-maker).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FMCA 1234">Counsel for the first respondent noted the concession made by Mr Zipser for the applicant and also drew the Court's attention to the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184 at [16] in which it was held that "The asserted fact that the applicant was unaware of the Tribunal's hearing was of no legal relevance" (also see SZEYH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 93 at [30] ; Freeman v Health Insurance Commission [2004] FCAFC 335 at [52] and NBAZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 971 at [11] --- [13]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] FMCA 1230">Such has been held in two indistinguishable cases in the Federal Court (see Re B41 of 2003 [2004] FCA 30 at [26] , and the extensive discussion of Jacobson J in SZEYH v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 93 at [30-31] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] FMCA 1132">SZGJO v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 393 at [17] , and SZEYH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 93).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] FMCA 1076">It is also now well accepted that the applicant cannot plead the fault of his migration agent as constituting jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal: B41 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 30 ; SZEYH v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 93.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2006] FCA 807">13 Much the same principles apply in this case. Rather than request an adjournment, the appellant advised the Tribunal that he was not going to appear at the hearing. He cannot now complain that he was denied an opportunity to appear. The appellant says that he would have requested an adjournment if the Tribunal had informed him that it would have granted one. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the appellant did not request an adjournment. Moreover, the appellant implored the Tribunal to continue in his absence. There is no breach of procedural fairness in these circumstances: see further SZEYH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 93 per Jacobson J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2006] FMCA 771">Even if Mr Meng failed to advise him of the invitation to the hearing or wrongly advised him not to attend, this could not vitiate the Tribunal's decision to proceed under s.426A(1) by reason of his non-attendance (see SZEYH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 93).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2006] FMCA 742">In SZEYH v The Minister [2006] FCA 93 [21]-[35] Jacobson J considered the authorities relating to claims that the failure of a migration agent can ground jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2006] FCA 587">33 An applicant for review is bound by the way in which his agent acts on his behalf even though the agent may do things that cause the applicant to be unaware of what is happening. As Jacobson J said in SZEYH v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 93 at [25] : 
 
 'In NADK of (2002) v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184 a Full Court dealt with a claim by an applicant that his migration agent did not notify him of the hearing. The Full Court concluded at [16] that " the asserted fact that the applicant was unaware of the Tribunal's hearing was of no legal relevance" . ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2006] FCA 573">10 Counsel for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ('the Minister') has pointed out that in SZEYH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 93 , particularly at [25], Jacobson J reviewed cases dealing with allegations that communications between applicants for review and their migration advisers were not relevant to the issue of the entitlement of the Tribunal to act on the basis of its dealings with the migration adviser. His Honour there said:
 
 'In N ADK of 2000 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA FC 184 ; a Full Court dealt with a claim by an applicant that his migration agent did not notify him of the hearing. The Full Court concluded at [16] that, " the asserted fact that the applicant was unaware of the Tribunal's hearing was of no legal relevance ". ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2006] FCAFC 32">23 Moreover, it is well established that it is no part of the decision maker's duty to make out an applicant's case for him or her: see Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 170. The procedure is inquisitorial. It is for an applicant to advance whatever evidence or argument he or she wishes to advance in support of the contention of the well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason: see Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [187] per Gummow and Hayne JJ. A passage to this effect was recently relied upon also by Jacobson J in SZEYH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 93. </sentence>
