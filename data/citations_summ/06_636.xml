<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 111">The proper subject of " directions " is the manner in which a trustee is to discharge his functions so as to protect him from liability to a creditor for breach of duty: Re Weber [2006] FCA 636 , 154 FCR 80. Finn J there relevantly observed: 
 
 [2] While s 134(4) of the Act empowers a trustee to seek directions "in respect of a matter arising in connexion with the administration of the estate", it is well accepted that the Court is not for that reason obliged to give the directions sought: Re Driller (1972) 21 FLR 159. The proper subject of directions, in my view, is the manner in which a trustee should act in carrying out his or her functions as such: cf Re GB Nathan &amp; Co Pty Ltd (in liq) (1991) 24 NSWLR 674 at 679.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1962">42 The liquidator also relied upon Macks (trustee of the estate of Weber), Re Weber (bankrupt) [2006] FCA 636 ; (2006) 233 ALR 50. I do not think that decision is of particular significance. Relevantly, it concerned the entitlement of creditors under certain contracts to prove in the joint and several estates of the bankrupts by reason of s 95 of the Bankruptcy Act : see per Finn J at [13] --- [16].</sentence>
