 ... the occasion for summary judgment must be clear before it will be granted: see Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 at [13] per Tamberlin J. Summary judgment is inappropriate where there is a real dispute about the relevant facts and evidence: see Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 489 at [10] per Besanko J and Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v G E Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [31] to [48] per Rares J; Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Limited [2006] FCA 1441 at [23] per Tracey J; and Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] per French J. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1078">14 I will not recite the details of all the interlocutory steps taken in the proceedings. However, two should be mentioned. On 4 April 2007 I refused an application by the applicant for summary judgment on part of its claim: Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 489. In May 2007 I dealt with an application by the respondents for a stay or dismissal of the proceedings by reason of non-compliance by the applicant with various orders of the Court. The details of the application are set out in my reasons on a question of costs: Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 903">2. The applicant pay the respondents' costs of the application by notice of motion dated 5 March 2007. 
 

I delivered reasons: Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd (ACN 007 031 905) v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (ACN 069 894 275) [2007] FCA 489 . 8 Again on that occasion the respondents asserted that the applicant had not complied with the December orders. I indicated to the parties that if either party complained of a failure to comply with orders of the Court, then an appropriate application should be made on notice.</sentence>
