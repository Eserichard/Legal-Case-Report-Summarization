<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1198">The Minister also contends that, in any event, even if there was a technical breach of s 424A , discretionary relief should be refused on the basis that the appellant did not suffer any substantial injustice; the Tribunal was prepared to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt regarding the information in question: see SZKGF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 84 ; SZJSP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1925 at [29] ; SZLYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1322 at [52] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 972">Whilst the respondent's solicitor, in her helpful written submissions, has provided me with authority that clearly establishes that the failure to properly address the notifications to the applicant do not constitute a jurisdictional error: SZJSP v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1925 , this is no longer an issue because the applicant himself has said that he has no further complaint about the address. The failure to include the name of the suburb did not prevent the applicant from receiving the documents or attending the hearing. In all the circumstances I have been unable to find that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in the manner in which it reached its decision. I dismiss the application. I order that the applicant pay the first respondent's costs which I assess in the sum of $3,800.00.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 347">In that case, their Honours (Stone, Jacobson and Edmonds JJ) noted that in the circumstances of the case before them: "there has been no practical injustice" ( SZKGF at [8]) and, in context, that this was relevant to the issue of the exercise of the Court's discretion (see also SZJSP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1925 (" SZJSP "), in particular, at [28] to [30] per Madgwick J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1606">Mr Godwin also submitted that the issue need not be resolved as it is superfluous because the Applicant's claim was doomed to fail for other reasons. He referred the Court to the decision in SZKGF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [19] where the Full Court of the Federal Court refused relief in its discretion where there was a technical breach, referring at [15] to the decisions in re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam [20] at [38]; VUAX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [21] at [56]-[57]; SZJSP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [22] at [28]-[29]. In all of these decisions it had been held that there was no practical injustice. </sentence>

 ORDERS
 
 (1) The Application is dismissed. (2) The Applicant is to pay the First Respondent's costs fixed in the sum of $6,350.00. It is further submitted that even if the Court were to consider that there had been a relevant breach of s.424B , the Court ought to exercise its discretion and refuse relief; see SZJSP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [31] at [23] to [27] and [29]. However, in SZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [32] the Full Court of the Federal Court narrowed the scope of SZJSP and declined to follow it. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 1322">Their Honours indicated that were they to find there had been a jurisdictional error they would in the exercise of their discretion decline to grant relief given the clear absence of any practical injustice or even inconvenience to the appellant (at [13]). The Court referred to a lack of practical injustice as the basis for the exercise of the discretion to refuse relief. As Madgwick J stated in SZJSP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1925 at [29] , to set aside the Tribunal's decision and require the reconsideration of the appellant's claims de novo in such a case would be "to allow the triumph of mere technicality over substance ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCAFC 122">93 It was contended by the first respondent that this Court should follow the decision of Madgwick J in SZJSP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1925. It was contended there is nothing in the decision of SAAP [2005] HCA 24 ; 228 CLR 294 inconsistent with the approach adopted by his Honour. It was said that the observations of McHugh and Hayne JJ are to be read in light of the observation by Kirby J that the failure to provide the written document in that case did have potential ramifications for procedural fairness. See also SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 per Kirby J at [74]-[77].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCAFC 84">7 An application for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision was dismissed by Scarlett FM on 18 December 2007. In relation to alleged jurisdictional error based on failure to comply with s 424A of the Migration Act , the Federal Magistrate, at [25], accepted that Minister's submission that there had been no jurisdictional error as "perhaps despite the Tribunal's efforts rather than because of them" the Tribunal's errors had no effect on the discharge of its substantive obligations. His Honour observed that the submission was "clearly correct both in law and at commonsense". His Honour also referred to the observations of Madgwick J in SZJSP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1925 at [28] - [30], a decision which he held was binding on him.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FMCA 2153">That submission, to my mind, is clearly correct both in law and at commonsense. The decision of Madgwick J in SZJSP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [11] clearly takes a similar approach in [28]- [30]. In that case where there is a somewhat similar error his Honour said at [29]: To set aside the Tribunal's decision and require reconsideration of the appellant's claims de novo would be, in my opinion, to allow the triumph of mere technicality over substance and would be, as Lindgren J observed in Giretti 70 FCR at 165, to put the appellant in a better position than if the technical error had not occurred.  For the respondent Minister, Mr Cleary of counsel, relied on the written outline of submissions and also drew the Court's attention to the decision of Madgwick J in SZJSP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [4] . The significance of that decision can be seen by reference to [28]-[30] where his Honour dealt with a default by the Tribunal in sending certain notification to the applicant that was described by his Honour as: patently one of a mere clerical oversight rather than a studied misapplication of the law. </sentence>
