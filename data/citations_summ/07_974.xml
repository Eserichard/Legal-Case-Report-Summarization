<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 1018">The Court must be persuaded that there are "compelling and exceptional circumstances" not to order indemnity costs. An element of this issue of compelling and exceptional circumstances is the issue of public interest. The argument has been advanced that it is not in the public interest to award indemnity costs against Mr Vassallo in proceedings which arise under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) . In Access for All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc. v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 per Collier J at [27] where her Honour states: [27] First, it is clear from a number of cases that the fact that the case is a human rights and/or discrimination case does not of itself automatically characterise the proceedings as being in the public interest with the result that the court should divert from usual orders as to costs (Sluggett v HREOC [2002] FCA 1060 and Fetherson v Peninsula Health (No 2) [2004] FCA 594 ). Similar considerations apply where, for example, the proceedings are instituted by a litigant with a view to protection of the environment (Australian Conservation Foundation Inc v The Commonwealth of Australia [1979] HCA 1 ; (1980) 146 CLR 493 ; Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth [2006] FCAFC 51 ; [2006] FCAFC 51 ; (2006) 230 ALR 411 ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 36">42 On 2 July 2007, the Federal Court (Edmonds J) in Nishtom Pty Limited &amp; Ors v Robinson [2007] FCA 974 decided the proceedings and ordered the defendants' Proof of Debt lodged in Mr Kinsella's bankruptcy with the plaintiff for the occupation fee up to 30 August 2006 be accepted in the amount of $119,646.44.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1340">In Pitt v One Steel Reinforcing Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 923 Justice Gray ordered the unsuccessful applicant to pay the respondent's costs in that human rights matter. In Rana v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 907 Lander J awarded costs against the unsuccessful applicant in that human rights matter that was found to be an abuse of process, and the applicant had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding. In Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 Justice Collier held that a human rights and/or discrimination case will not automatically be regarded as a proceeding in the public interest. In Theodore Xiros v Fortis Life Assurance Ltd [2001] FMCA 15 ; (2001) 162 FLR 433 Driver FM dismissed the application but declined to award costs to the respondent on the basis of a significant public interest element. " ... His Honour stated: All human rights proceedings contain some element of public interest in that the legislation is remedial in character, addressing the public mischief of discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1375">

31 Other cases decided recently in this Court show that these principles are regularly applied: see, e.g., Barrett Property Group Limited v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 (" Barrett ") at [3]-[5] per Gilmour J; Xat Ky v Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd (No 2 ) [2007] FCA 1785 at [12] - [13], [29] per Middleton J; Access for All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] per Collier J; Jainshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 per Besanko J; and Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] - [5] per Finn J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 864">56 As Collier J observed in Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] , in the context of the exercise of the discretion concerning costs, the issue is whether there is anything about the particular proceedings to persuade me that it is appropriate to depart from the usual order. Other decided cases in which some but not all factors are present or cases that present different considerations are ' not particularly helpful ' ( Fetherston at [12] per Heerey J). I note that in no other case cited by the parties were all of the factors present that arise in these proceedings. For example, the application was only made after judgment was given ( Dibbs ; Access For All Alliance ) or the case could not be characterised as public interest litigation ( Access For All Alliance ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 629">This is so even where the ordinary practice is departed from. The aim is not to punish or deter future litigants but simply to compensate a party fully for costs which normal party-party costs could not be expected to do, where it was unreasonable for that party to be subjected to any expenditure of costs, such as where a hopeless proceeding is brought: Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4]- [5]. Any departure from this general rule requires a special reason: Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] ; Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v Next Publishing Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 971 at [5] . The categories in respect of which departure from the usual rule are contained are not closed: John S Hayes &amp; Associates Pty Limited v [Kimberly-Clark] Australia Pty Limited (1994) 52 FCR [201]; Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [32] . In Colgate-Palmolive, (at p 233) Sheppard J identified various categories which might give rise to an award of indemnity costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1823">3 An award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge except as provided by any other Act: Federal Court of Australia Act s 43(2). The discretion must be exercised judicially. In the normal course, costs are ordered to be paid on a party and party basis: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232; Re Wilcox; Ex parte Ventura Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 152 at 158 per Cooper and Merkel JJ. A costs order is not intended to punish the unsuccessful party but rather to compensate the successful party: Hurst and Devlin v Education Queensland (No 2) [2005] FCA 793 at [5] . This is so even where the ordinary practice is departed from. The aim is not to punish or deter future litigants but simply to compensate a party fully for costs which normal party-party costs could not be expected to do, where it was unreasonable for that party to be subjected to any expenditure of costs, such as where a hopeless proceeding is brought: Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] - [5]. Any departure from this general rule requires a special reason: Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] ; Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v Next Publishing Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 971 at [5] . The categories in respect of which departure from the usual rule are contained are not closed: John S Hayes &amp; Associates Pty Limited v Kimberley-Clarke Australia Pty Limited (1994) 52 FCR 203 ; Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [32] . </sentence>
