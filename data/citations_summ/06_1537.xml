<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 141">Courts are generally more reluctant to order a self-represented litigant to pay costs on an indemnity basis. In this case I am not satisfied that a self represented litigant such as Mr Zoltaszek should have known that there was no prospect of success or that he acted in a high-handed manner, proceeded vexatiously or made allegations which ought not to have been made, such that his rejection of the offer of settlement made at that time or any other circumstances warranted an award of indemnity costs. I have borne in mind that Mr Zoltaszek is a self-represented litigant lacking knowledge of the law, the practice of the court and, possibly, objectivity (see to similar effect Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 8) [2006] FCA 1537 and Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 1594). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 1256">This, it is submitted, bears directly upon the reasonableness of the plaintiffs' refusal to accept the offer. Compare Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No. 8) [2006] FCA 1537 at [21] per Kenny J (notice that offeror would press ahead with application for indemnity costs if offer refused entitled to little weight where offeree unrepresented, because self-represented litigant may not appreciate the risk). " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 689">In Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 8), [9] Kenny J considered whether indemnity costs should be awarded against an unrepresented party. The litigant, in that case, had been put on notice that such an application would be made in circumstances where the conduct of the hearing by the litigant prolonged the hearing and wasted time. Her Honour noted at paragraph 20: On the one hand, litigants in person, even if partially assisted by lawyers, often produce significant difficulties and unnecessary expense for the parties against whom they proceed: see Bhagat v Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Life Assurance Australia Ltd [2000] NSWSC 159 at [13] per Hodgson CJ in Eq. These difficulties arise from their lack of knowledge of the law, unfamiliarity with court practice and, sometimes, lack of objectivity and want of lawyerly skills in reading and writing. Mr Spalla suffers, to some degree, from the disabilities of most self-represented litigants. There may be other factors too that compound a self-represented litigant's inability to utilise court procedures appropriately. On the other hand, a person's capacity to gain redress for legal wrongs in the courts should not depend on his or her ability to pay for legal representation. In seeking to balance these considerations, the courts have been generally more reluctant to make orders for indemnity costs against self-represented litigants than against legally represented litigants.

 In the principal judgment delivered in this matter, [1] I dismissed the plaintiff's application for damages in circumstances where liability had been admitted in connection with a slow speed, low impact motor vehicle accident involving the plaintiff as the driver of one car and the defendant as the driver of the other. In Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd and Ors (No. 8) [7] Kenny J said this: 
 
 On the one hand, litigants in person, even if partially assisted by lawyers, often produce significant difficulties and unnecessary expense for the parties against whom they proceed. These difficulties arise from their lack of knowledge of the law, unfamiliarly with court practice and, sometimes, lack of objectivity and want of lawyerly skills in reading and writing. ... There may be other factors too that compound a self represented litigant's inability to utilise court procedures appropriately. On the other hand, a person's capacity to gain redress for legal wrongs in the Courts should not depend on his or her ability to pay for legal representation. In seeking to balance these considerations, the Courts have been generally more reluctant to make orders for indemnity costs against self represented litigants than against legally represented litigants.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] VSCA 209">17 But as a general rule a court will be more reluctant to make an order for indemnity costs against a litigant in person than against a represented litigant. [22] The prevailing circumstances of the case might be such as to allow the Court to overcome this reluctance. [23] Robson J in Vink v Tuckwell [24] conveniently summarised the effect of the authorities dealing with circumstances in which a non-represented litigant might be subject to an order for indemnity costs as follows: 
 
 
 [103] There are special considerations applying to indemnity cost orders against litigants in person, as the following authorities disclose. [104] In Bhagat v Royal and Sun Alliance Life Assurance Australia Ltd , Hodgson CJ in Eq observed: 
 ... I accept that a court does have to make allowances for the position of litigants in person, and to try to ensure that such a litigant does not lose out because of lack of expertise; although there is a limit to what the Court can do in that regard, while still remaining an impartial determinant of a dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1403">61 Although this Court has expressed greater reluctance to order indemnity costs against an unrepresented litigant, it may do so: Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 8) [2006] FCA 1537 at [20] and [26] per Kenny J. In Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 1594 Heerey J relevantly observed:
 [7] In Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd [2006] FCA 1537 Kenny J at [26] recently noted that courts have from time to time overcome a reluctance to order indemnity costs against self-represented litigants: Bhagat v Global Custodians [2002] FCAFC 51 and Ogawa v The University of Melbourne (No 2) [2004] FCA 1275. Kenny J considered the competing interests in determining whether to make an award of indemnity costs against a self-represented litigant. A lack of knowledge of the law, unfamiliarity with court practice and a lack of objectivity are common traits of unrepresented litigants. A person's ability to get redress should not depend on lawyerly skills or an ability to pay for legal representation. However, the Court owes a duty to all parties to ensure that the trial is conducted in a fair and timely fashion (at [28]) and without significant difficulties and unnecessary expense for the parties against whom an unrepresented litigant proceeds. see Bhagat v Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Life Assurance Australia Ltd [2000] NSWSC 159 at [13] per Hodgson CJ. ...

[90] In this instance the expense, delay and difficulties caused by the applicant's fraudulent and unreasonable behaviour overshadow any limitations that arose from his status as self-represented. [91]  106 In Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No.8), [81] Kenny J said:
