<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 267"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 133">This appeal is in the nature of a rehearing and not an appeal in the strict sense: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507. The question on appeal is whether the decision of the Federal Magistrate is affected by some legal, factual or other error: Allesch v Maunz (2000) 203 CLR 172 at [23]. The appellant must demonstrate that the judgment under appeal is a consequence of some legal, factual or discretionary error: Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1558 at [4] ; MZWVH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1016 at [10] ; SZJJC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 614 at [13] --- [15]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1284">In SZMIP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 217 , Flick J stated: 
 
 
 [9] The jurisdiction which is relevantly conferred on this court is to entertain an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court. The first two purported Grounds of Appeal identify no error said to have been committed by that court. No appellate jurisdiction is conferred on this Court to entertain any appeal from a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. 
 
 

 
 
 
 [10] Even if that difficulty be left to one side, the problem confronting the Appellants is only compounded by the fact that (as framed) the first two purported Grounds of Appeal do not comply with O 52 r 13(2)(b) of the Federal Court Rules , namely the requirement to state "briefly, but specifically, the grounds relied upon in support of the appeal". A statement that a Tribunal has "declined to exercise its jurisdiction" or has committed "jurisdictional error" does not satisfy that requirement. In attempting to provide a "useful practical guide", it has been said that a "notice of appeal which cannot be used to provide a sensible framework for the appellant's submissions" will "almost certainly" fail to comply with the requirements of O 52 r 13(2)(b): Commonwealth v Evans [2004] FCA 654 at [35] ; [2004] FCA 654 ; 81 ALD 402 at 411 per Branson J. 
 
 

 
 
 
 ... 
 
 

 
 
 
 [12] Neither of these two difficulties --- namely the failure to identify any error committed by the Federal Magistrate nor the failure to identify with acceptable precision the "ground of appeal" --- is considered to be a mere matter of form: SZJJC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 614 at [15] . Both are considered essential to this Court only exercising such jurisdiction as has been committed to it by the federal legislature. 
 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 337">Secondly, as a result, the question on appeal is whether the decision of the Federal Magistrate is affected by some legal, factual or other error: Allesch v Maunz (2000) 203 CLR 172 , 180. The Appellant must demonstrate that the judgment under appeal is a consequence of some legal, factual or discretionary error: Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1558 at [4] ; MZWVH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1016 at [10] ; SZJJC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 614 at [13] - [15]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 217">Neither of these two difficulties --- namely the failure to identify any error committed by the Federal Magistrate nor the failure to identify with acceptable precision the " ground of appeal " --- is considered to be a mere matter of form: SZJJC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 614 at [15] . Both are considered essential to this Court only exercising such jurisdiction as has been committed to it by the federal legislature. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1129">24 I understand that these are not isolated cases. Flick J noticed the practice of appellants using proforma grounds of appeal in SZJJC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 614. Jessup J encountered this practice earlier this year and refers to it in his judgment in SZLMM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 801. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 802">18 The appellant must demonstrate that the judgment under appeal is a consequence of some legal, factual or discretionary error: Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1558 at [4] ; MZWVH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1016 at [10] ; SZJJC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 614 at [13] - [15]. That is the ambit of the Court's appellate jurisdiction: s 24 of the FCA Act . The appellant did not attempt to demonstrate any arguable error in the reasons of the Federal Magistrate. For the reasons outlined below, I cannot identify an appellable error. An appeal would have no prospects of success.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 754">39 If there were to be a more focussed source of advice being proffered to unrepresented litigants, being advice which is merely " pro forma " in nature and divorced from the merits of an individual case, it may be appropriate for costs to be ordered against those providing such advice rather than the unrepresented appellant: SZJJC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 614. Even more fundamental issues may emerge if advice were being provided contrary to legal practitioners' legislation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 801">17 Quite recently, in SZJJC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 614 , Flick J had cause to make some critical observations about pro forma grounds of appeal relied upon in this court which were barely related to the facts of the case and which were quite unhelpful in disclosing alleged error. His Honour said:
 Although an unrepresented appellant may well seek the assistance of others and, although it is an appellant who must ultimately bear the responsibility for the content of any notice of appeal, in those circumstances where it becomes apparent that a notice of appeal has in substance been drafted by someone other than the appellant (and perhaps drafted with little regard to the facts of an appellant's individual case) it may be appropriate that this is the person, and not the unsuccessful appellant, who should have to pay such costs as may be awarded. And it may be that costs should be awarded against that person on an indemnity basis. In the present proceedings there was no satisfactory explanation as to who it was who drafted the Notice of Appeal, the Appellant himself (not surprisingly so) having no knowledge of the specific statutory provisions to which the Notice of Appeal refers... 
His Honour set out the provisions which were relevant, the provisions to which the Notice of Appeal had referred in that case. </sentence>
