<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 204">[32] 
72 It was submitted Ms Doyle SC (who appeared with Dr Bigos of counsel on behalf of A J Macken &amp; Co) that P &amp; V Industries Pty Ltd v Anthony Porto &amp; Ors (No 3) [33] and ASIC v Mercorella (No 3) [34] reflect current Australian law in drawing a distinction between documents created in furtherance of the commission of a fraud (to which the crime/fraud exception may attach) and documents which come into existence subsequent to the commission of a fraud (which remain protected by the privilege).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 449">The communications in issue are not confined to advice about litigation. Some communications concern the retainer agreements with MBC. No privilege attaches to most of those communications if for no other reason than the fact that copies of the agreements had been provided to Multiplex, by way of discovery, in other litigation. Even if copies had not been provided to Multiplex, it is unlikely that communications about their terms would be covered by privilege. MBC told registrants that it would not give them advice about the retainer agreement as it had a conflict of interest (I say nothing about the correctness of this statement). Having indicated it would not give registrants legal advice about the agreement, nothing it did say could be characterised as a confidential communication made in a professional context. Further, there are cases which hold that an executed retainer agreement is not in any event privileged: Cook v Pasminco Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 1819 ; (2000) 107 FCR 44 , 53 per Lindgren J ("In my opinion, generally, an agreement between solicitors and their prospective client as to the terms of retainer of the solicitors does not attract either kind of legal professional privilege mentioned"); Securities and Investments Commission v Mercorella (No 3) [2006] FCA 772 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 40 , 45 per Mansfield J ("[A]n engagement letter between a solicitor and a client is not privileged except to the extent that it records legal advice or material touching upon legal advice to be given"); CSR Ltd v Eddy [2008] NSWCA 83 ; (2008) 70 NSWLR 725 , 739 per Basten JA ("The purpose of client legal privilege is to protect confidential communications between client and lawyer for the purpose of obtaining legal advice and the provision of that advice and communications in relation to the conduct of litigation. The existence of a retainer between client and lawyer is not the subject of the protection, but a precondition to its operation. Accordingly, and generally speaking, the retainer will not be privileged"). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] QSC 193">The recent case of Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mercorella (No 3) [2006] FCA 772 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 40 provides an example of the denial of legal professional privilege to documents in furtherance of a sham transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 964">19 This conclusion is in line with the cases: see Barclays Bank Plc v Eustice [1995] EWCA Civ 29 ; [1995] 1 WLR 1238 (communications relating to a transaction entered into at an undervalue for purposes of defeating a creditor); Gartner v Carter [2004] FCA 258 (advice sought to restructure a corporate group to put assets beyond the reach of a secured creditor); Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mercorella (No 3) [2006] FCA 772 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 40 (advice obtained about the grant of securities to one class of creditors that would defeat the rights of other creditors).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] VSC 113">28 The plaintiff seeks to rely on three single instance cases as authorities to support the Master's statement that "to conceal a fraud is to act in furtherance of it": Re Golightly [16] ; ASIC v Mercorella (No 3) [17] and Plumb v Monck. [18] In fact, when one examines each of those authorities, they do not support such a broad principle. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 1234">The principle extends to 'trickery' and 'shams'. A 'sham' refers to steps which take the form of a legally effective transaction but which the parties intend should not have the apparent, or any, legal consequences: Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471 ; see also Beazley v Steinhardt [1999] FCA 447 ; (1999) 106 A Crim R 21 ; affirmed on appeal in [1999] FCA 1255 (' Beazley' ). The recent case of Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Mercorella (No 3) [2006] FCA 772 provides an example of the denial of legal professional privilege to documents in furtherance of a sham transaction. In that case, creditors of a managed investment scheme claimed privilege over documents relating to securities obtained from the defendant and certain companies in the scheme. The transactions were allegedly entered into so as to advance those creditors' interests over the interests of other creditors to the scheme.</sentence>
