<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 363">The circumstances of this case are distinguishable from the conduct of the applicant in Moussa v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2011] FCA 67. The applicant in Moussa had continually sought adjournments at different stages of the proceeding; failed to attend some hearings; failed to pay previous costs orders; and was pursuing an appeal that Tracey J regarded as having little prospect of success. Similarly, the conduct of the applicant in Burgess v Centrelink &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 595 ; (2007) 159 FCR 500 is distinguishable from this case. In Burgess , the applicant's appeal from the decision of Federal Magistrate Wilson was thought to have a very limited chance of success; the applicant had previously failed to satisfy costs orders; and the applicant had enjoyed numerous opportunities to ventilate the merits of his contentions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 67">These are broad discretionary powers. In Burgess v Centrelink [2007] FCA 595 ; (2007) 159 FCR 500 at 503 Greenwood J identified a range of considerations which, depending upon the circumstances of the case, may guide the exercise of the discretion. His Honour said: 
 
 "The considerations include whether the application for security for costs has been brought promptly; an assessment of the strength of the merits of the appeal and the bona fides of the appellant in bringing the appeal; whether the impecuniosity of the appellant was caused and, I might add, contributed to by the conduct of the respondents; whether the application for security for costs, in all the circumstances, is oppressive having regard to the circumstances of the appellant; whether there are persons who otherwise have an interest in the outcome of the proceedings; and other general discretionary questions going to the public interest.
