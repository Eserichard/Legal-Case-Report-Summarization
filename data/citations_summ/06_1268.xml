<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 190">The purpose of an award of interest under s 51A is compensatory: see Spangaro v Corporate Investment Australia Funds Management Ltd (No 2) [2003] FCA 1363 at [2] per Finkelstein J; HK Frost Holdings Pty Ltd (in liq) v Darvall McCutcheon (a firm) [1999] FCA 795 at [5] - [7] per Finn J. In Wenkart v Pantzer [2010] FCA 866 at [129] Flick J identified a secondary purpose for an award of interest, namely, 'to provide a discouragement to respondents form delaying the conclusion or settlement of the proceedings'. At the same time, the award of interest is not punitive: Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 at [408] (Lander J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 919">CIT points out that the "jigsaw puzzle" presented by the Commission is not sufficient if it does not make clear whether what is alleged against the Finance Companies is a first stage offer, a second stage offer, or a supply case and whether it is based on proved fact or inference. If the latter, it says that it is entitled to know the precise inference and how the jigsaw is put together. It is also entitled to know the compulsive aspect of the condition. CIT relies on what was said by Lander J in Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 at [278] , that it must be actual knowledge, not constructive knowledge that is established and that, while knowledge may be inferred, it must be the only rational inference available.

Appl'd: Donald Financial Enterprises Pty Ltd v APIR Systems Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1269 at [10] per Edmonds J. A secondary purpose is to provide a discouragement to respondents from delaying the conclusion or settlement of the proceedings. However, " [i]nterest should be compensatory and not punitive ": Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 at [408] .

 75B Interpretation (1) A reference in this Part to a person involved in a contravention of a provision of Part IV, IVA, IVB, V or VC, or of section 75AU, 75AYA or 95AZN, shall be read as a reference to a person who: (a) has aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contravention; ... (c) has been in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention; ... Section 75B does not require that a person knew he was participating in a contravention of the Act; what is required is actual knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention and intentional participation in it: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 666---70 per Mason ACJ, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ; Rawley Pty Ltd v Bell (No 2) [2007] FCA 583 at [40] per Finn J; Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 at [267] ---[280]. There may be some circumstances where knowledge may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances: cf Pereira v Director of Public Prosecutions [1988] HCA 57 at [11] , 82 ALR 217 at 219---20.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCAFC 120">96 Second, the question in each case is whether all of the elements of the contravention are made out against the individual or whether he or she merely acted as a corporate organ, binding the company but not the person individually: Cleary v Australian Co-Operative Foods Ltd (Nos 2 &amp; 3) [1999] NSWSC 991 ; (1999) 32 ACSR 701 at [54] , [56] and [57]; Pico Holdings Inc v Voss [2004] VSC 263 at [157] ; Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 at [297] ---[305].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 477">I am satisfied on the evidence before the Court that the second respondent, as managing director of the first respondent who conducted the negotiations and made some of the representations, had knowledge of the essential facts constituting the contravention and was an intentional participant based on that knowledge within s.75B(1)(c) in the sense considered in Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1958) 158 CLR 661 at 670. Also see Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 at [269] per Lander J. Hence I find for the purposes of these proceedings that the second respondent was involved in the contravention of s.52 of the TPA by the first respondent. Damages

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 65">28. The ACCC has pleaded that EDirect has breached ss 52 and 58 of the Trade Practices Act by engaging in this conduct. To establish a breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act it is not necessary for the ACCC to show that EDirect knew that the statements it was making were untrue and that it intended to mislead or deceive : see Geocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 paragraph [268], referring to Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Ltd v Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd (1978) 10 CLR 216 at 228 and to Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 197. The situation is different under s 58(a) of the Trade Practices Act where intention is a necessary element: see Barton v Westpac Banking Corporation (1983) 76 FLR 101 ; (1983) 150 ALR 397 at 409 and Swann v Downes [1978] FCA 15 ; (1978) 34 FLR 36 at [46] . However, in this case, the ACCC has specifically relied upon s 58(b) of the Trade Practices Act which does not involve intention, but rather objective standards of reasonableness: see ACCC v Commercial and General Publications Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 900 at [213] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] WASC 10">72 I should mention in passing that it is not alleged (or at least it does not appear to be alleged) by the plaintiff that the defendant was primarily liable under s 9 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (WA), although a number of authorities on s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the equivalent provisions in the State Fair Trading Acts, have held that if a director or employee of a corporation engages, in trade or commerce, in conduct on behalf of the corporation which is misleading or deceptive, not only is the company primarily liable for the contravention, but the individual is also primarily liable, and not merely as an accessory: see Houghton v Arms [2006] HCA 59 ; Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 119 at [13] , [87] - [89]; Nescor Industries Group Pty Ltd v Miba Pty Ltd (1997) 150 ALR 633 at 641 ; Cleary v Australian Co-operative Foods Ltd [1999] NSWSC 991 ; (1999) 32 ACSR 701 ; Citibank Ltd v Liu [2003] NSWSC 569 at [53] , and on appeal Wong v Citibank Ltd [2004] NSWCA 396 at [19] ; Astvilla Pty Ltd v Director of Consumer Affairs [2006] VSC 289 at [169] - [175]; Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 at [295] - [300].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2006] NSWSC 1348">259 Authorities on s 52 of the Trade Practices Act , and the equivalent provisions in the State Fair Trading Acts, clearly establish that if a director or employee of a corporation engages, in trade or commerce, in conduct on behalf of the corporation which is misleading or deceptive, not only is the company primarily liable for contravention of s 52 , but the individual is also primarily liable, and not merely as an accessary, for contravention of the equivalent State provisions ( Arktos Pty LTd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 119 at [13] , [87]-[89]; Nescor Industries Group Pty Ltd v Miba Pty Ltd (1997) 150 ALR 633 at 641; Cleary v Australian Co-operative Foods Ltd [1999] NSWSC 991 ; (1999) 32 ACSR 701 ; Citibank Ltd v Liu [2003] NSWSC 569 at [53] , and on appeal Wong v Citibank Ltd [2004] NSWCA 396 at [19] ; Arms v Houghton [2006] FCAFC 46 at [38] , [40], [42]; Astvilla Pty Ltd v Director of Consumer Affairs Victoria [2006] VSC 289 at [169] - [175]; Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 at [295] - [300]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2006] HCATrans 544">To that list should be added the decision that is referred to in the submissions of the interveners of Genocanna Nominees v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd , [2006] FCA 1268 , the relevant passages being between paragraphs [265] and [306]. I think the only other matter I wanted to refer to 
is the judgment referred to in our written submissions of a recent judgment of Justice Lander of the Federal Court in Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 and the only point I wanted to mention there is interestingly in this case one of the respondents, the third respondent, was a director of a corporation and he was found guilty of what appears to be the same conduct of both accessorial liability in respect of the company and primary liability for his own conduct.</sentence>
