<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] WASC 74">132 Recently, in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 2059 , Sackville J made a lump sum order, in lieu of taxation, in a complex, long-running case in circumstances where the parties were in agreement that lump sum costs should be awarded. Again with the agreement of the parties, his Honour heard the proceedings in respect of costs while sitting with a deputy registrar who was experienced in the taxation of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1423">It would be extremely odd if the more expeditious procedure contemplated by r 4(2)(c) resulted in either a successful or an unsuccessful party being exposed to an assessment of costs which simply ignores or overrides the basic principles applicable to a taxation of costs. I accept Mr Sheahan's submission that it would be an error for a Court to use its power under r 4(2)(c) to assess a gross sum clearly higher than that which would be allowed on a taxation of costs. 
 

 
His Honour also went on to observe that " [c]are should be taken, however, to ensure that the process does not take on too many of the characteristics of a taxation of costs ": [2007] FCA 2059 at [30] .  In Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 2059 , Sackville J has further usefully summarised the applicable principles as follows: 
 
 PRINCIPLES 
 

 
 
 [25] The authorities establish a number of principles applicable to a claim for a gross sum costs order to be made pursuant to FCR , O 62 r 4(2)(c): 
 

 
 
 
 (i) The purpose of the subrule is to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation involved in protracted litigation arising out of taxation: .... 
 
 

 
 
 
 (ii) An order that costs be assessed as a gross sum does not envisage that any process similar to that involved in taxation should take place. On the contrary, the Court applies a much broader brush than would be used on a taxation of costs pursuant to O 62: ... 
 
 

 
 
 
 (iii) The Court should be confident that the approach taken to the estimate of costs is logical, fair and reasonable. The Court should be astute to avoid both overestimating the recoverable costs and underestimating the appropriate amount, for example by applying an arbitrary discount to the amounts claimed: ... 
 
 

 
 
 
 (iv) Although the power to assess a gross sum for costs involves the exercise of a discretion, it is necessary to bear in mind fundamental principles applicable to an assessment of costs on a party and party basis.</sentence>

On the contrary, the Court applies a much broader brush than would be used on a taxation of costs pursuant to O 62: Beach Petroleum v Johnson (No 2) , at 120, 124, per von Doussa J; Harrison v Schipp , at 743 [22], per Giles JA.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 455">The purpose of the sub rule is to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation involved in protracted litigation arising from the taxation process: see Beach Petroleum NL &amp; Claremont Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 at p 120 per von Doussa J, applying Leary v Leary [1987] 1 All ER 261 ; Australasian Performing Rights Association v Marlin [1999] FCA 1006 at [3] ; Black &amp; Decker Inc v GMCA Pty Ltd (No 4) [2008] FCA 1737 at [3] and Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 2059 at [3] and [25]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 392">The discretion conferred by O 62 r 4(2)(c) has been frequently invoked. The purpose of the rule is "to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation involved in protracted litigation arising out of taxation" : Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 at 120 per von Doussa J. See also: Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 2059 at [3] per Sackville J. It is not a rule, however, confined to complex litigation: Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 at [189] per Jacobson J. There is " no particular characteristic of a case which must exist before a gross sum costs order can be made ": Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 3) [2006] FCA 916 at [23] per Mansfield J. It is a power, by way only of example, which has frequently been exercised during the course of considering an appeal in migration cases involving the refusal of protection visas: e.g. BZAS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 449 ; SZCAJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 779 ; SZLKH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 745 ; SZNSL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1543. The underlying premise in migration cases for exercising the power may be the appropriateness of such an order being made where a migrant appellant is frequently unrepresented (and may even fail to appear at the hearing) and where the quantum of the costs order sought by a respondent Minister is self-evidently justifiable. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 32">The Court has discretion pursuant to O 62 r 4(2)(c) FCR to order that a party should be entitled to costs by way of a gross sum rather than taxed costs. Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 2059 (at [25]) said: The authorities establish a number of principles applicable to a claim for a gross sum costs order to be made pursuant to FCR , O 62 r 4(2)(c): 
 
 
 (i) The purpose of the subrule is to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation involved in protracted litigation arising out of taxation: Beach Petroleum v Johnson (No 2) , at 120, per von Doussa J, applying Leary v Leary [1987] 1 All ER 261 ; Harrison v Schipp [2002] NSWCA 213 ; (2002) 54 NSWLR 738 , at 742 [21] per Giles JA.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 1227">In this particular instance, Sirtex makes the point that it does not seek to recover any fees in respect of clerks or managing clerks on the basis that they were, in fact, working as "solicitors". They only seek to recover fees on the basis that it is just and reasonable to assess these persons at a level more generous than "managing clerks" as identified in Item 31 and rely in that regard on the approach taken by Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 2059 at [51] --- [59].  In the instant case, as noted above, on 14 August 2008, French J ordered that the assessment of Sirtex's costs against UWA proceed by way of gross sum, in accordance with O 62, r 4 of the FCR. For present purposes, I accept (as do the relevant parties) that the principles applicable to a claim for a gross sum costs order under O 62, r 4(2)(c) are those enumerated by Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 2059 at [25] --- [32], as follows: 
 
 [25] The authorities establish a number of principles applicable to a claim for a gross sum costs order to be made pursuant to FCR , O 62 r 4(2)(c):

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] QSC 84">[4] 
 
 [9] I intend to fix costs for the following reasons: 
 
(a) A joint report by expert costs assessors has been provided to the court and there is no reason to regard it as being other than logical, fair and reasonable in its conclusions; 
(b) The report agrees on all issues of quantum subject to decisions being made on whether costs should be allowed at all for:
 (i) The costs of a report from expert accountants, 
(ii) The costs of a report from expert valuers, 
(iii) The costs incurred by SCAC in changing solicitors some five days before trial,
 (c) If a further, more detailed assessment was undertaken it would cost between $50,000 and $60,000 and take some four to five months to complete; 
(d) The plaintiffs are impecunious --- it would be wrong to require the defendants to spend more money which is unlikely to be recovered from the plaintiffs; [5] and 
(e) The plaintiffs do not object to costs being fixed (but they do submit that, if costs are fixed on an indemnity basis, they should not include GST). " 
 [8] The principles which, in the exercise of the discretion allowed by the rule, should be applied have been the subject of recent consideration in a number of cases: 
 
(a) Purpose of the rule: to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation involved in protracted litigation arising out of assessment of costs; [2] 
(b) Fundamental basis of an order: the court must be satisfied that the approach taken to the estimate of costs is logical, fair and reasonable; [3] 
(c) Process: an assessment by which costs are fixed does not require a process similar to that of an ordinary assessment of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1827">4 The relevant principles and details of previous cases where O 62 r 4(2)(c) gross sum assessments have been made are summarised by Sackville J in Seven Network News Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 2059 at [25] - [34]. I incorporate that passage in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 874">5 The principles which govern the application and the circumstances under which this rule is to be applied were dealt with by Lehane J in Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc [2000] FCA 628 particularly at [22]---[27]; and by Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 2059 , particularly at [16] and [25]---[34]. I need not repeat those principles here. I am satisfied that Ms Vine-Hall's assessment is in accordance with the principles reflected in those passages from those judgments. I am therefore satisfied as to the merits of the application.</sentence>
