<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 156">I should also make the point that although in this case the Tribunal sent a letter to the appellants after the hearing pursuant to s 424A of the Act, that fact cannot overcome any failure to accord procedural fairness at the hearing: SZIOZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1870 at [59] ; SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911 ; (2008) 102 ALD 598 at 611 [56] .  The question arises as to whether this letter, sent by the second Tribunal to the appellant after the hearing, satisfies its s 425 obligations. In SZIOZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1870 the Tribunal sent a letter to an applicant after the hearing advising that a certain fact was in issue. The Tribunal had not advised the applicant that this fact was in issue during the hearing. Besanko J held (at [59]) that this sort of letter cannot satisfy the provisions of s 425(1) of the Act. Rares J came to the same conclusion in SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) (2008) 102 ALD 598 ; [2008] FCA 911 at [56] . I respectfully agree with these conclusions The second Tribunal did not inform the appellants of the central and determinative issues in the review
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 303">However, counsel submitted that the Court could not infer from the absence of the Tribunal's decision record that it was not an issue that had been put by the Tribunal to the Applicant. In support of that submission, counsel referred to NAOA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 241 at [21] per Beaumont, Merkel and Hely JJ, where their Honours noted that there was no transcript or affidavit before the trial Judge as to what had occurred before the hearing. Mr Reynolds did not specifically refer to NAFF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 , where the High Court found that a tribunal's decision record alone is evidence of what happened at the hearing. However, Mr Reynolds did refer the Court to SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911where those cases were discussed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 167">In SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2) [2008] FCA 911 His Honour Rares J stated at [57]: [57] The appellant had no opportunity to give evidence or to make submissions, in accordance with s 425(1) , that she had not just learnt what she knew about Christianity and the Local Church since arriving here. That was a denial of procedural fairness: SZBEL 228 CLR at 165 [44]. 
The situation in the matter before this Court can be distinguished from the procedure adopted in SZJYA (supra). In the 'Findings and Reasons' of the Tribunal decision, it records the issues that were raised with the Applicant in respect of the attendance of the Local Church in Australia. I am satisfied that no procedural error or legal error amounting to jurisdictional error is apparent in the reasons of the Tribunal decision.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1443">Moreover, on the basis of the Tribunal's decision record, it is clear that the Tribunal explained to the applicant at the hearing the effect of s 91R(3) of the Act: cf SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 753">Mr Reynolds submits that there are two reasons why this argument is not of merit. It is for the applicant to prove that this issue was not raised with her at the Tribunal hearing. In the absence of a transcript, or an affidavit as to what occurred at the hearing the applicant cannot prove that the matter was not put to her: NAOA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 241 ; SZJYA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 841">No error can be found in the above reasoning of the Federal Magistrate. As his Honour noted, the Tribunal was obliged to make findings about the appellant's conduct in Australia, before considering the effect of s 91R(3). This was not a case where the Tribunal failed to raise the 'issue' (in the SZBEL sense) of s 91R(3) with the appellant at the hearing (Cf: SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 ; [2007] FCA 942 ; (2007) 163 FCR 304 ; SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911). The Tribunal's findings were open to it, that the appellant's Falun Gong activities in Australia were for the sole purpose of enhancing a claim to a protection visa. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 569">Hence it is not necessary to determine whether this is a case in which an inference should be drawn that a particular matter was not raised at the hearing based on what appears in the reasons for decision (cf SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) and Another [2008] FCA 911 ; (2008) 102 ALD 598. This ground is not made out. Section 424A 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 486">But the caution expressed as to the dangers in too readily drawing inferences from an incomplete factual foundation is to be heeded. The decision in NAOA has since been followed: NBBO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1132 at [31] per Conti J. The Full Court, it has also been said, " simply made its comments based on the particular facts of that case ": SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911 at [32] , [2008] FCA 911 ; 102 ALD 598 at 606 per Rares J. In an appropriate case, inferences may be drawn from an account given by a Tribunal member: e.g. Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 62 at [28] to [30] [2004] HCA 62 ; , 221 CLR 1 at 10 to 11 per McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 296">It has not been established that there was a failure to comply with s.425 of the Act. On the contrary, as indicated above, in the course of the hearing the Tribunal raised issues of concern, including the issue of the applicant's inability to demonstrate the movements without hesitation as it would have expected and the fact that the demonstration of the second set of exercises he provided bore no relation to the movements involved in the second set of exercises. It also raised the issue of the location of the Falun. In this way it raised with the applicant issues that it considered dispositive. I am not persuaded that it is necessary for the purposes of s.425 that the Tribunal put to the applicant the source of its concern, in so far as the source of the concern is based on independent country information, provided that it raises clearly with the applicant the nature of the its concern and the relevance of that concern. The Tribunal did so in this case. It is apparent that the applicant was put on notice by the Tribunal as to the matters in issue. More generally as to the obligation under s.425 and the Tribunal's obligation to inform of possible adverse findings see SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) and Another [2008] FCA 911 ; (2008) 102 ALD 598 and SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 91). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 98">The Applicant also refers to and relies upon the decision of Rares J in SZJYA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2) [2008] FCA 911 and the decision of Lander J in Applicant S298/2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1793. However, the factual circumstances in those cases are far removed from those in the present case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 1715">I note that in SZKTI the Full Court also canvassed the possibility that after the Tribunal had obtained additional information it may be obliged by s.425(1) of the Act to issue a further invitation to the applicant to a hearing to address new issues arising from that information, even if that information had been put to the applicant in a s.424A letter. While their Honours saw " some force " in this argument, they found it unnecessary to decide the question as the appeal succeeded based on the Tribunal's failure to follow the procedures in ss.424(2) and (3) and 424B (but see SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 ; (2007) 163 FCR 304 and SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) and Another [2008] FCA 911 ; (2008) 102 ALD 598). In the absence of any submissions on this issue and given my findings on s.424A it is not necessary to decide this question, despite the fact that it is raised by the fact that the Tribunal obtained information from the Consulate General and the PSB after the hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 1605">It is the case that in SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911 Rares J was prepared to draw an inference that a particular matter had not been raised with an applicant at a Tribunal hearing, based on what the Tribunal set out in its statement of reasons as to what occurred at the hearing. His Honour found that it was clear from the High Court decision in Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 that the Tribunal decision record alone is evidence of what happened at the hearing. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 1303">For completeness and as a matter of fairness, counsel for the First Respondent took me to the relatively recent decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911 (" SZJYA "). That was a case in which the Court found that the treatment of the Applicant's sur place claims had not been properly dealt with pursuant to s.425 because the Applicant was not given a fair opportunity to respond to those aspects of concern about that evidence that the Tribunal had. That was a case turning very much on the operation of s.91R(3) of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FMCA 1267">In SZJYA v Minister for Immigration (No 2) [2008] FCA 911 , Rares J considered the question of evidence on matters such as this and at [33] his Honour said: "Ordinarily, the best way of proving what occurred at the hearing before the tribunal would be to tender the transcript or a tape of the hearing. A less fulsome method may be to read an affidavit or lead oral evidence giving an account of what occurred. Notwithstanding that, I am of opinion that what the tribunal has set out in its statement of decisions and reasons is some evidence of what occurred at the hearing; indeed it was the only evidence on that question before his Honour and on appeal.

 ORDERS
 
 (1) The Application is dismissed. (2) The Applicant is to pay the First Respondent's costs fixed in the sum of $3500.00. It is further submitted that there was no breach of s.425 and, even though there were circumstances, as set out in the decision of Rares J in SZJYA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [8] , where notwithstanding an applicant's failure to provide a transcript of the Tribunal hearing, there may be circumstances where it is unclear from the decision record as to whether or not relevant issues had been put to the applicant, Ms Griffin, however, submitted that the Court should distinguish SZJYA on the facts as the Tribunal had clearly put the issues to the applicant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FMCA 857">The Tribunal was of the view that the fact the applicant had not found the Local Church in Sydney at the time of her application did not explain why no supporting documents were provided to the Department before it made its decision. It found that this raised doubts about her claim of involvement in the Local Church in Sydney since February 2007, her credibility generally and the genuineness of her religious activities in Australia. It ultimately accepted, based on the letters of support and that the applicant had demonstrated some level of understanding of Christianity and the Local Church faith, that she had been attending the Local Church in Sydney. However for what it described as " adverse credibility reasons " (given that she did not provide supporting material to the Department before it made its decision in April 2007 " and without any more evidence in support ") the Tribunal was not satisfied that she had been involved in those activities since February 2007. On the " evidence as a whole " it was not satisfied she had engaged in any religious activities in Australia other than for the purpose of strengthening her claim and hence disregarded her religious activities in Australia under s.91R(3). It was also not satisfied she was a genuine believer or practitioner of the Shouters faith. I note that the Tribunal recorded its concern about the genuineness of her conduct in Australia and doubts about her claims were put to the applicant in the hearing (cf SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911). It also raised with her the possible implications to be drawn from the absence of such information in connection with the protection visa application and the fact that, despite the time that passed before the primary decision was made, the applicant did not provide any evidence to the Department in relation to her activities in Australia with the church.
