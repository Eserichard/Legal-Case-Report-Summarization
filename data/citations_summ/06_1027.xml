As Besanko J said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cambur Industries Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1027 at [96] , referring to Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at 91 [89] - [90]: 
 
 A declaration ... must identify the contravening conduct. It must be precise in its terms, such that a person reading the declaration understands the nature of the contravention and, in broad terms, the conduct constituting the contravention. On the one hand, it is not necessary to put all the relevant findings of fact in the declaration, but, on the other, the gist of the conduct (as found) should be identified.

[2] The report of this judgment at (1998) 85 FCR 327 is significantly abridged and not useful for the purpose of considering the appropriate penalty. [3] The Court did not order any penalties because the relevant companies were in liquidation; however these were the penalties that would have been ordered had the companies not been in liquidation.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1859">28 I also accept that the proposed penalties are consistent with the proper application of the totality and parity principles: compare Digital Products and Dataline at [64]-[75]. I was referred to a schedule of previous determinations. Whilst I have had regard to it, I have also borne in mind the observations in Dataline , where a Full Court said (at [67]-[68]):
 
 [T] he Court is confirmed in the view that there is little to be gained in undertaking ... a detailed comparative analysis of the conduct of each corporation in the identified cases, the extent to which particular officers of those corporations engaged in the contravening conduct or the scale and dimension of the conduct. The constellation of circumstances, essential character of the conduct and the factors to be weighed by the Court are inevitably sufficiently different in each case that previous determinations ultimately provide little utility in precisely informing the appropriate pecuniary penalty to be imposed in any particular contravention. 
 
 However, an assessment of previous determinations in relation to resale price maintenance conduct may provide a high level broad range within which an appropriate pecuniary penalty may be imposed having regard to the character and content of the contravention and other considerations reflecting some elements broadly consistent with the evidence in the particular case. 


After making these observations, the Court undertook an analysis of several cases with sufficiently similar facts to provide a high level broad range of comparison. The penalties imposed in a number of cases ( Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 152 ; [2005] 215 ALR 482 (" Dermalogica "), Humax , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Tooltechnic Systems (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 432 , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Westminster Retail Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2005] FCA 1299 , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v High Adventure Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 247 , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cambur Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1027 , Dataline (upholding the decision in Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665) , Jurlique , and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chaste Corporation Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2005] FCA 1212) give a high level broad range of comparison for this case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCAFC 146">65 The Court has also considered the further authorities referred to in ACCC's submissions on the appeal, namely, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cambur Industries Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1027 ; (2006) ATPR 42-127 per Besanko J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Digital Products Group Pty Ltd [2007] ACompT 2 ; (2007) ATPR 42-145 per Tracey J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Jurlique International Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 79 per Spender J; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Tooltechnic Systems (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 432 per Kiefel J. </sentence>
