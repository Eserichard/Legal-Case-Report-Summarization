<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 5">30 This is an appeal from a judge of this Court against orders as to costs: Haviv Holdings Pty Limited v Howards Storage World Pty Limited (No 2) [2009] FCA 652 ('the costs judgment'). There was no appeal from the anterior judgment: Haviv Holdings Pty Limited v Howards Storage World Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 242 ; (2009) 254 ALR 273 ('the substantive judgment'). 
  5 On 18 March 2009, the primary judge delivered reasons for judgment, dealing with the substance of the case. Those reasons are published as Haviv Holdings Pty Limited v Howards Storage World Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 242 ; (2009) 254 ALR 273. On that occasion, her Honour adjourned the proceeding for further directions. On 7 May 2009, her Honour made some substantive orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWDC 355">18 The plaintiff relied upon a number of authorities that I did not find helpful because they depended upon their own facts and contractual provisions. The decision of Jagot J in Haviv Holdings Pty Limited v Howards Storage World Pty Limited [2009] FCA 242 that was referred to in claiming damages extending over 10 years involved a contract that ran for a term of 10 years with an option to renew for a further 10 years. That was far removed from the situation in this case where the terms of the contracts were one year only. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 652">On 18 March 2009 I delivered my principal reasons for decision in this proceeding ( Haviv Holdings Pty Limited v Howards Storage World Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 242). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] VSC 150">16 Although damage is not an element of the cause of action for breach of contract, a plaintiff will be limited to nominal damages only unless, on the balance of probabilities, the plaintiff has affirmatively established that the breach has caused 'assessable damage ... which is capable of being measured in monetary terms'. [10] In this regard, senior counsel for National Foods submitted that the onus of proof had shifted in this case; thus requiring the McMahons to prove that aspects of the loss claimed were not caused by the breaches which have been established. Reliance was placed upon the following statement by Jagot J in Haviv Holdings Pty Limited v Howards Storage World Pty Ltd: [11] 
 
 (8) It has also been said that, while the plaintiff has the onus of showing loss caused by the breach, "if the loss in question is the apparent or likely result of the breach, the onus shifts to the contract-breaker to prove that it was not" (Seddon and Ellinghaus at [23.34] citing Reg Glass Pty Ltd v Rivers Locking Systems Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 64 ; (1968) 120 CLR 516). Further, in Henville v Walker (2001) 206 CLR 459 ; [2001] HCA 52 at [148] McHugh J said (albeit in a trade practices context) "(a)rguably, once a plaintiff demonstrates that a breach of duty has occurred that is closely followed by damage, a prima facie causal connection will be established. It is then for the defendant to show that the plaintiff should not recover damages. In the words of Dixon CJ in Watts v Rake [1960] HCA 58 ; [(1960) [1960] HCA 58 ; 108 CLR 158 at 160], it is the defendant who must disentangle, so far as possible, the various contributing factors". </sentence>
