<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1102">In SZJHE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1771 at [11], Flick J reviewed the authorities relevant to an allegation of bad faith in the following terms: ... An allegation of "bad faith" is serious (SCAS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 397) and cases in which " bad faith " will be established " will be rare and extreme and claims of bad faith must be clearly particularised ": Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 394 at [32] , [2007] FCA 394 ; 66 ATR 225. In NAKF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 730 , 130 FCR 210 Gyles J reviewed the authorities and concluded as follows as to that which has to be established to make out " bad faith ": [24] Bad faith cannot be constituted by recklessness in the sense of negligence, no matter how gross the negligence. A tribunal member cannot blunder into bad faith, no matter how stupid and careless the tribunal member is, any more than a person can blunder into deceit ... What is required to make out this case is to find that the tribunal member was recreant to his duty by wilfully and deliberately making the impugned decision without attempting to carry out the statutory duty lying upon him --- tossing a coin without reading the file, allowing in every third applicant, or allowing in applicants from various countries in rotation might be examples. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1771">11 The contention that the Tribunal made a decision in " bad faith " is likewise to be rejected. An allegation of " bad faith " is serious ( SCAS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 397) and cases in which " bad faith " will be established " will be rare and extreme and claims of bad faith must be clearly particularised ": Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 394 at [32] , [2007] FCA 394 ; 66 ATR 225. In NAKF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 730 , 130 FCR 210 Gyles J reviewed the authorities and concluded as follows as to that which has to be established to make out " bad faith ":
 [24] Bad faith cannot be constituted by recklessness in the sense of negligence, no matter how gross the negligence. A tribunal member cannot blunder into bad faith, no matter how stupid and careless the tribunal member is, any more than a person can blunder into deceit...

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1403">Both are serious allegations. But such applications have long been heard and determined by Judges of this Court without a jury. Although it must readily be recognised that an allegation of " bad faith " is a " very serious allegation " to make, it is an allegation that has in fact been made in other proceedings against both a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (eg, Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 394 at [32] , [2007] FCA 394 ; 66 ATR 225) and against others exercising statutory power (eg, SCAS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 397 at [19] ; SBBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 361 , 194 ALR 749). " Fraud " or " equitable fraud " is likewise a very serious allegation. Public confidence in the administration of justice by this Court, it is considered, has only been enhanced by this Court entertaining and resolving such " serious " allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 60">28 Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 394 ('Haritopoulos') was a decision of Besanko J on an application for summary dismissal of an application filed by Haritopoulos Pty limited on 30 March 2006 seeking relief under s 39B of the Judiciary Act in relation to an assessment and penalty assessment made by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. His Honour ordered that the proceeding be dismissed. Relevantly, the case concerned the consequences of the Deputy Commissioner failing to consider a package of information said to be relevant to the assessment in question which was said to have been provided to the Deputy Commissioner before the assessment was made. At [31] his Honour said:
 
 '... on this application it is appropriate that I assume that it [the package] was information relevant to the assessment. No undertaking was given by the respondent prior to the making of the assessment that the package of information would be considered; in fact, it was made clear that it would not be considered, but held by the respondent pending an objection to the assessment. ... The applicant claims that the respondent's failure to consider the package of information constitutes an arguable case of bad faith or an arguable case of a breach of s 166 of the [Assessment] Act or an arguable case of a breach of the rules of procedural fairness and, in particular, the hearing rule. ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 874">19 Taking facts alleged in the present statement of claim at their highest, the issues which might point to invalidity of the assessment and of the penalty assessment are the same as those which Besanko J addressed in Haritopoulos [2007] FCA 394. They are a failure to provide particulars of the assessment and of the penalty assessment; secondly, the issue of the assessment on 15 September 2005 when, a few weeks earlier, an officer of the respondent had anticipated that it would take six to eight weeks for a default assessment to issue; thirdly, the fact that the penalty assessment was issued so close in time to the assessment; and finally, the failure to consider the package of information provided on 3 November 2005 before making the assessment (although it is clear that there was no undertaking given to consider that material before making the assessment, and in fact it was made plain on 20 October 2005 and in the letter of 8 November 2005 that a default assessment would issue notwithstanding the provision of that further information). 12 On 30 March 2006, Haritopoulos Pty Ltd also issued proceedings under s 39B of the Judiciary Act in this Court (matter SAD 54 of 2006) against the respondent for orders that certain notices of assessment of income tax against it were invalid as not having been made in good faith and having been made for an improper purpose. In particular, Haritopoulos challenged the validity of an assessment issued on 8 November 2005 in respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2002 by which Haritopoulos was assessed for income tax liability at $2,813,000 (plus certain other amounts to which I do not need to refer), and the validity of an assessment issued on 24 November 2005 imposing a penalty assessment of $2,109,750. On 25 May 2006, the respondent applied to summarily dismiss that application. The motion was heard on 29 August 2006. Judgment was given on 23 March 2007. Justice Besanko found that, on the material before the Court, Haritopoulos had no arguable case that the assessment challenged was made in bad faith and entered summary judgment dismissing the proceeding in its entirety: Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 394. </sentence>
