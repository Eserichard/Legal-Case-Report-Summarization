<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 185">The greater the degree of objective similarity, the more likely it will be that that inference will be drawn: SW Hart &amp; Co v Edwards Hot Water Systems (at 472); Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch and Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Carlisle Homes Pty Ltd[2008] FCA 375. 
 
 70 The operative similarity need not be, and indeed rarely will be, to the entire work. However, correspondence to a substantial part of the applicant's design will be sufficient to ground infringement: Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd(2007) [2007] FCA 1509 ; 74 IPR 52. It is not necessary to show that the alleged copy is a perfect reproduction of a substantial part of the applicant's work: British Northrop Ltd v Texteam Blackburn Ltd [1974] RPC 57 at 72 per Megarry J.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 31">8 The respondents previously brought a proceeding seeking to protect their copyright in that part of the Seattle house plan and the Memphis house plan comprising the al fresco quadrant. The principal respondent to that proceeding was Metricon Homes Pty Ltd ("Metricon"). Metricon designed, built and sold residential project homes in Victoria, and one of its house plans and houses was called the Streeton. The Streeton is referred to later in these reasons. The respondents were successful before Gilmour J and an appeal to the Full Court of this Court was dismissed: Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1509 ; (2007) 74 IPR 52 ; Metricon Homes Pty Ltd v Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 712 ; (2008) 248 ALR 364.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 965">13 According to the respondent, even that slim hope must have dissipated once the respondent's evidence was filed on 15 May 2007. This set out clearly on oath the evidence of the three key individuals associated with the design of the Villa View, namely, Mr Di Natale, Mr de Weerd, and Mr Lazarovski. They each swore that the Villa View was based on changes made to earlier plans designed by the respondent over an extended period. They denied having seen, or having been aware of, any of the applicant's plans, or having inspected any of its homes: cf Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1509 ; (2007) 74 IPR 52. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] NSWCA 56">91 It is, therefore, appropriate to treat s 135 as engaging the power to reject admissible evidence in circumstances where the admission might satisfy any one of the three classes of danger set out in the section. Such an approach was adopted in circumstances not dissimilar to the present in Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1509 by Gilmour J at [161]. In addressing a photograph sought to be tendered by the respondents, his Honour considered that prejudice arose "from the failure of the respondents to provide this evidence prior to the hearing or even to adduce it in chief, so as to enable it to be properly considered and responded to by the applicants". His Honour also noted that the photograph was not clear in its depiction of a key factor and that, had it been admitted, he would have placed no weight upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 440">26 Counsel for the applicants submits that the following four principles apply to the requests that have been made in these proceedings:
 
 
 1. The general object of particulars is to inform the opponent of the nature of the case it has to meet as distinguished from the way in which such case will be proved: Duke v Wisden (1897) 77 LT 67 at 68; G W Young &amp; Co Ltd v Scottish Union &amp; National Institute Insurance Co (1907) 24 TLR 73 at 74; R v Associated Northern Collieries [1910] HCA 61 ; (1910) 11 CLR 738 ; Aga Khan v Times Publishing Co [1924] 1 KB 675 ; McAndrew v Gray (1920) 20 SR (NSW) 635 ; Philliponi v Leithead (1959) 76 WN (NSW) 150. 2. Furthermore, whilst a party should be required to provide the best particulars it can (having regard to the object of particulars), an order will not be made for particulars which the Court is satisfied the party cannot give: Higgins v Weekes (1889) 5 TLR 238 ; Marshall v Inter Oceanic Steam Yachting Co (1885) 1 TLR 394 ; Cyril Leonard &amp; Co v Simo Securities Trust Ltd [1972] 1 WLR 80. 3. In appropriate circumstances the Court can decline to order a party to provide particulars until after discovery and/or interrogatories, for example where the particulars are solely within the knowledge of the other party: Jingellic Minerals NL v Abigrouop Ltd (1992) 7 WAR 566 at 570, 575 (FC). 4. Substantial reproduction is a matter for the Court to determine, and it may be assisted by expert evidence: Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1509 ; Pacific Gaming Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1636 ; Bulurru Australia Pty Ltd v Oliver [2000] NSWSC 0580.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCAFC 46">1 The corporate parties to this appeal are competitors in the Victorian project homes market. The appeal, which is brought pursuant to leave granted by this Full Court, is from an interlocutory judgment of the Court. On 17 March 2008, for reasons published by his Honour on 28 September 2007 (now published at [2007] FCA 1509 ; 74 IPR 52) , the learned primary judge (a) made declarations concerning the infringement by the appellants of the second respondent's copyright in the Seattle 31 house plan and the first respondent's copyright in a house built in accordance with that house plan; and (b) granted injunctive relief intended to restrain future infringements by the appellants of the respondents' respective copyrights. The issue of the financial relief, if any, to which the respondents are entitled remains to be determined by the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 375">7 Barrett has recently successfully sued another home builder for copyright infringement in respect of the Seattle design: Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1509.

I gratefully adopt that review and incorporate it in these reasons.

On 24 October 2007, by consent, a declaration of infringement of copyright by Metricon as well as declarations that Palazzesi and Popple authorised such infringement were made. Those orders were made following my judgment in the matter which was delivered on 28 September 2007: Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1509. The question of costs which was held over for further argument is now before the Court for resolution. </sentence>
