615 Although s 51A does not prescribe a rate of interest, the usual practice in the Federal Court has been to adopt the rates of interest applied in the Supreme Court of the State in which the application is commenced unless there is evidence that the rates are penal or not commercial: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 at [7] , Gordon v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 603. The current rate of interest prescribed under s 47 Supreme Court Act 1995 (Qld) is 10% per annum. No submissions were made by the parties as to an appropriate rate of interest. I consider that the rate of interest of 10% per annum under the Supreme Court Act should be applied.
