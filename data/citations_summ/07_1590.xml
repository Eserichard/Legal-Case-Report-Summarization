<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1043">18 Appeals from decisions of the Tribunal to this Court are confined to " a question of law " and are to be filed within 28 days: Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), s 44(1) and (2A)(a). Prima facie the rule is that proceedings commenced outside the prescribed 28 day period ought not to be entertained: Jeilles v Secretary, Department of Employment &amp; Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1590 at [9] . There is, however, a discretion to extend that time. The principles relevant to that discretion have been conveniently set forth by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 and those principles have since been repeatedly applied in a variety of contexts in which an extension of time is sought: eg, Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria (No 4) [2007] FCA 1449 at [47] ---[48] [2007] FCA 1449 ; , 97 ALD 721 at 730; SZGCA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 224 at [4] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] WAIRComm 1273">One of the fundamental requirements of procedural fairness is a right to be heard. In Jeilles v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1590 , Logan J said at paragraph [23]:- 
" [23] A convenient summary of the content of procedural fairness or natural justice, as sometimes it's called, as known to our law, is to be found in a leading Australian text on administrative law, namely: Aronson, Dyer and Groves, "Judicial Review of Administrative Action", Third Edition, at p 370. There, the learned authors state: 
 
 There are two traditional rules of natural justice. The hearing rule requires a decision maker to hear a person before making a decision affecting the interests of that person. "
