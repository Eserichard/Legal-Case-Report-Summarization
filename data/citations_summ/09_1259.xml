<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 307">22 The Courts have considered a number of factors in deciding whether to make a gross sum costs order. They include the conduct of the Defendant in connection with the proceedings ( Sony Entertainment v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788) ; whether the party obliged to pay the costs order is able to meet a liability which is likely to result from assessment ( Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No. 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 ; Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc Julien v Secretary of Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (No. 2) [2009] FCA 1259 at [12] per Spender J) and the related question of whether the costs of the proceedings are disproportionate to the amount claimed ( Kiwi Munchies Pty Limited v Stern [2006] NSWSC 433 at [17] per McClellan CJ at [6]).</sentence>
