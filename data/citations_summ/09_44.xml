<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 695">It is clear from Evans v Wainter (supra) at 217 that it is not an improper purpose to seek an order for examination while litigation is pending against the person the subject of the summons or entities connected with that person. In McCann (in his capacity as liquidator of Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Mason [2009] FCA 44 Finkelstein J said at pars [5] and [6]: The relevant legal principles are not in doubt. An examination summons will be discharged if it is oppressive, unfair, an abuse of process or has been issued for an improper purpose: Sent v Andrews (2002) 6 VR 317 , 320; Re Southland Coal Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 259 ; (2005) 189 FLR 297 , 303. An examination summons will not be oppressive, unfair, an abuse of process or improper merely because there is on foot litigation between a liquidator (or the company in liquidation) and the proposed examinee. Thus, in Sent at 320, Buchanan JA said: "Where an examination relates to proposed or current litigation, in general terms the question is 'whether the examination is genuinely for the information of the liquidator to aid him in considering whether there is a cause of action upon which he will proceed ..." In Re Southland Coal at 302-303, Young CJ in Eq said: "It is clear that it is no basic objection to the issue of an examination summons on the ground of oppression that the liquidator may ascertain the strength of the case of a person with whom the company is involved in litigation". 
 On the other hand, a liquidator is "not entitled to conduct a dress rehearsal of the cross-examination in an action or to seek to damage the opposing parties case by attacking the credibility of that party's witness": Sent at 320; see also Re Hugh J Roberts Pty Ltd (1970) 91 WN (NSW) 537. In Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21 ; (1989) 166 CLR 486 , 498, Mason CJ put it this way: "[I]f a liquidator were to conduct an examination directed to compel the examinee to disclose defences or to give pre-trial discovery, or to establish guilt, this examination may be restrained as an abuse of process". It is not, however, enough that "there is a chance that this will occur": Re Southland Coal at 303. "
