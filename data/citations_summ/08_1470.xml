<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 35">s.664(b) of the Act, which provides: "it is a defence in the proceedings if the employer proves that the termination was for a reason or reasons that do not include a proscribed reason (other than a proscribed reason to which subsection 659(3) or (4) applies). Because of the factual conclusion I have reached, I do not need to address the discussion raised in submissions, and in the case-law there set out, in relation to whether proceedings in either the AIRC and or the AAT formally come within the statutory terms of s.659(2)(e) or s.793(1)(j). Generally, see for example, the discussion by Goldberg &amp; Jessup JJ in CSR Viridian Ltd v Claveria [2008] FCAFC 177 ; (2008) 171 FCR 554 at pp.567-572 [37] --- [46], and by Jagot J in Dowling v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1470 ; (2008) 172 FCR 96 at pp.120-124 [75] --- [96]. [79] [2010] FCA 648. [80] (1998) 193 CLR 280 and [1999] HCA 63 ; (1999) 200 CLR 177 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 1021">In his written submissions, Mr Joseph argues that s.793(1) generally needs to be viewed in its statutory context as part of the overall protections provided by the Freedom of Association provisions. Those protections are wide ranging and beneficial in nature: MUA v Burnie Port Corporation [2000] FCA 1189 ; (2000) 101 IR 435 at [51] . It is submitted that s.793(1)(a) does not simply protect an employee from being dismissed due to their membership --- i.e. simply that they hold a union member card. It is submitted that the proper view of the subsection is that it ought to be construed as providing protection to union members who may wish to avail themselves of the benefit of union membership in what may be described as ordinary union activities: Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Belandra Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 910 ; (2003) 126 IR 165 at [134] --- [150]; NUW v Quenos Pty Ltd (2001) 108 FCR 90 at [124] --- [125]; Dowling v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1470 ; (2008) 172 FCR 96. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 28">9 Following the grant of leave to appeal from the ultimate decisions of 26 June and 28 July 2008 of Cameron FM, appeals to this Court were brought by the appellant. Those appeals, in proceedings NSD 1031 of 2008 and NSD 1197 of 2008 were heard by Justice Jagot (see Dowling v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1470 ; 172 FCR 96) , who upheld the appeals and remitted the matters to the Federal Magistrates Court for determination according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 339">However it is unnecessary, save in one respect, to detail that history. The applicant's case in the Proceedings, when the matter was before the Federal Magistrates Court, was dismissed by a Federal Magistrate as having no reasonable prospect of success. The applicant appealed to the Federal Court and, in a considered judgment which is now reported: Dowling v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1470 ; (2008) 172 FCR 96 , Jagot J concluded that, on the material before her, it was not possible to conclude that the applicant's claim had no reasonable prospects of success. In so far as her Honour had before her material concerning the facts, such material consisted of only untested allegations of fact by the applicant. In the course of reaching this conclusion, her Honour canvassed the operation of some of the relevant statutory provisions and concluded that the Federal Magistrate had adopted an unduly narrow construction of those provisions. I am satisfied, on balance, that towards the conclusion of this meeting the applicant said words to the effect " I am going to speak to Workcover ". Given that I am satisfied that the applicant said those words, it follows that I am satisfied that, for the purposes of s 793(1)(j) of the WR Act, he proposed to make a complaint to a body (Workcover) that has the capacity under an industrial law to seek compliance with that law: see Dowling v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1470 ; (2008) 172 FCR 96 at [85] per Jagot J.  It is convenient, at this point, to say something about the course the final hearing took. When the trial commenced, the applicant initially refused to lead any evidence. His position then was that having regard to the judgment of Jagot J ( Dowling v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1470 ; (2008) 172 FCR 96 and particularly what her Honour said at para [85]), a point had been reached where s 809 had been engaged and it was necessary for the respondents to lead evidence to prove that the alleged reason or reasons for the termination were not the reason or reasons or part of them. I indicated to the applicant that it was incumbent upon him to at least lead evidence at the trial to show that the basal facts which might engage s 809 of the WR Act could be established on his evidence. After some resistance, the applicant undertook this task which involved reading affidavits or parts of them and tendering certain documents.</sentence>
