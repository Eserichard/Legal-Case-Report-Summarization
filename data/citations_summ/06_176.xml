<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 106">Even in the context of migration cases where appellants are frequently unrepresented, it remains the obligation of an appellant to demonstrate legal, factual or discretionary error on the part of the Federal Magistrate: Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCA 1558 at [4] per Kenny J; Applicant M47/2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 176 at [27] per Young J; SZEPU v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 633 at [2] per Young J; SZITU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 758 at [33] per Greenwood J.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 848">In relation to the s.424A claim it is notable that in SZGSI and Another v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship and Another [2007] FCAFC 110 ; (2007) 160 FCR 506 the Full Court of the Federal Court found that where there were two or more applicants for review, the Tribunal was obliged to provide particulars of information provided in the course of the Tribunal hearing by one applicant to the other applicant, if the relevant information had the characteristics enlivening the duty created by s.424A of the Act (see Marshall J at [45] --- [57] with whom Moore and Finn JJ agreed on this issue). Their Honours were of the view that the word " applicant " in s.424A(3)(b) should be treated as a reference to each applicant individually, so that evidence given by another applicant was not within the exception to the obligation in s.424A(1). In reaching that conclusion Marshall J indicated that he no longer adhered to the contrary views he had expressed in MZWMQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 126 (and see M47/2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 176 to the same effect). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 452">In SZILK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 1318 his Honour Smith FM found: 39. The information relating to the statutory declaration which was identified by the Tribunal was that it "does not state that the applicant was a practitioner of Tien Tao in China". I consider that this information was sourced in the statutory declaration, and that it was used adversely as part of the Tribunal's reasoning. However, in my opinion the whole of that statutory declaration, including the limits of its contents, was information which the applicant "gave for the purpose of the application" within the exclusion of s.424A(3)(b). 40. This is because it was, as I have described above, presented by the applicant's agent to the Tribunal in support of her application for review. I do not consider that Federal Court authorities, which are somewhat discordant, in relation to the application of s.424A(3)(b) to evidence orally given by an applicant's witness appearing at a Tribunal hearing have relevance in the present situation (compare Young J's discussion in Applicant M47/2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 176 with Branson J's discussion in SZECG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 733). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 252">28 In relation to the third ground of appeal, the first respondent submits that there was no error in the Federal Magistrate's decision, as the appellants were provided with a s 424A letter. The first respondent submits that, in any case, on a joint application such as this one, information provided by one joint applicant need not be provided to other joint applicants: Applicant M47/2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 176 ; SZHTL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1052. 
  31 Finally, in relation to ground 3, I accept that although it is unnecessary for the evidence of one appellant to be put to another when two appellants submit a joint application for review to the Tribunal (ss 424A(1) and (3)(b); Applicant M47/2004 [2006] FCA 176 ; SZHTL [2006] FCA 1052) , that in any event, the Tribunal put any inconsistencies between the appellants' evidence that it relied upon to the appellants in the letter it sent to them on 20 October 2005. I have identified the matters contained in the letter earlier in these reasons. This third ground of appeal also fails.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 1614">32. Ms Clegg contends (see footnote 18 to paragraph 29 of her written submissions), that s.424A(3)(b) of the Act also applied to any information given by both applicants to the Tribunal at the hearing because they were joint applicants and members of the same family unit (see M47/2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 176 at [22] - [23], per Young J, MZWMQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1263 per Marshal J, SZHTL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1052 at [20-[21] , per Cowdroy J). I note, however, the proposition relied on by the first respondent was doubted by a Full Court of the Federal Court in SZBWJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 13 (at [45]). The issue of relation to s.424A of the Act , however, is resolved in that any evidence given by the applicant wife at the hearing as it related to the applicant and the inconsistencies in their evidence was put to the applicant in writing for comment in discharge of the Tribunal's obligations pursuant to s.424A(1) of the Act (see CB 123.8).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCAFC 110">50 Justice Young followed MZWMQ [2005] FCA 1263 in Applicant M47/2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 176 (' Applicant M47/2004' ). His Honour relied on an additional matter, not referred to in MZWMQ [2005] FCA 1263. Justice Young said that reg 1401(3)(c) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) supported the approach taken in MZWMQ [2005] FCA 1263. That regulation allows an application by a person claiming to be a member of the family unit of a person who is an applicant for a protection visa to be made at the same time and place as, and combined with, the application of that other person. However, that regulation deals with an application to a delegate and not with an application to the Tribunal. I do not consider that it supports the views expressed in MZWMQ [2005] FCA 1263 at [24] .  52 I regret that I did not have the benefit of full argument on this point in MZWMQ [2005] FCA 1263. On reflection, I do not consider that the views expressed there, or as endorsed by Young J in Applicant M47/2004 [2006] FCA 176 , can be sustained. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 392">78 Reference was made to a line of cases where the Tribunal had more than one applicant before it and a dependent applicant gave evidence which contradicted or tended to contradict the primary applicant's case. In MZWMQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1263 , the applicant's husband was also an applicant (a dependent applicant) before the Tribunal and gave evidence. Marshall J held that the husband was also an applicant. Section 424A(3)(b) excused the Tribunal from giving the applicant written notice of her husband's evidence. That decision was followed by Young J in Applicant M47/2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 176.

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2006] FCA 1801">8 On the appeal the Minister raised an additional matter not raised below: namely, 'that information provided by the wife appellant formed part of the reason for the Tribunal's ultimate decision' and that 'it could be said that information given by a member of the husband appellant's family unit (despite being a visa applicant) was not information given by the "applicant" for the purposes of the application' and, consequently, a breach of s 424A could be argued to have occurred. However, the Minister made the further submission that a similar situation to the present context was considered in MZWMQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1263 , in which Marshall J found that evidence given by a second applicant in a Tribunal proceedings falls within the exception provided in s 424A(3)(b). That decision was followed by Young J in Applicant M47 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 176 at [18] - [24].

The respondent has referred to Applicant M47/2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 176 , in which Young J held that in a joint application, evidence provided by an applicant whose application is based upon membership of the family of the primary applicant falls within s 424A(3)(b) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of the joint application. Accordingly, information provided by one joint applicant was not required to be provided to other joint applicants in accordance with s 424A(1). 21 The present situation is the converse of that considered by Young J in Applicant M47/2004 .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2006] FCA 761">21 Indeed, although it is unnecessary to decide the point, unlike his Honour, I would not accept that the substantive case that the appellants desire to make is a tenable one. The appellants' submission that they were denied procedural fairness because the Tribunal did not put all the inconsistencies mentioned in its reasons to them for comment before deciding the case against them does not disclose an arguable case. This is tolerably clear when regard is had to the well-recognized principles referred to in the first respondent's submissions: see [16] above and authorities such as Commissioner for ACT Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 (" Alphaone "); Pilbara Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs [2000] FCA 1113 ; (2000) 103 FCR 539 (" Pilbara Aboriginal Land Council "); and Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Cassim [2000] HCA 50 ; (2000) 175 ALR 209 (" Cassim "). It is well established that there will be no breach of procedural fairness when the Tribunal acts on information of which applicants should be aware: see Cassim at 214 [22]. It is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons that the appellants' legal representative was present throughout the hearing and was or should have been aware of the evidence that gave rise to the inconsistencies to which the Tribunal referred in its reasons. Further, the rules of procedural fairness do not require the Tribunal to notify an applicant of its mental processes or to provide an opportunity for it to comment on its findings before they are made: Alphaone at 591-592; also Pilbara Aboriginal Land Council at 555-557 [63]-[73]; and Applicant M47/2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 176 at [14] - [16].
