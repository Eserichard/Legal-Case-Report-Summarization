<citphrase id="cp25.10" type=cited from="[1979] FCA 45">common sense interpretation. the taxpayer was at all relevant times a subsidiary of wellington holdings pty. ltd. ("wellington"). the principal shareholder in wellington was mr. e.h. king. mr. king was beneficial owner of more than fifty per cent of the shares in wellington during 1964 and 1965, when the taxpayer incurred losses, and during 1971, the year of income of the relevant assessment.  wellington went into voluntary liquidation on 12th may, 1965. at that time the group, including the taxpayer, had no significant assets other than accumulated tax losses. on 7th june, 1965, winding-up orders were made in respect of the taxpayer and the other members of the wellington group.  on 18th july, 1967, mr. king and his wife entered into a written agreement with the liquidators, in their capacity as scheme trustees, to sell their shares in wellington to a "purchaser of the tax losses" of the subsidiaries of wellington, including the taxpayer. this agreement did not proceed. in 1968 the scheme trustees entered a deed with network finance ltd. ("network"). the deed provided that in consideration for certain loans by network, the trustees would deliver to network all of the issued shares of wellington on the completion of the scheme. the amounts lent pursuant to the deed were calculated by reference to the value of tax losses confirmed by the deputy commissioner of taxation.  mr. king thereafter co-operated with the scheme trustees in a manner which was inconsistent with his own rights and interest as a shareholder in wellington but which was necessary for the operation of the scheme.</citphrase>

64 This conclusion was followed by Gordon J in Star City Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1701. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 371">52 I accept that these authorities support the proposition that contemporaneously executed contracts forming part of the same transaction should, as a general rule, be read as a whole and construed by reference to each other: Star City Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1701 at [52] . However, it would go well beyond any concept of contractual context to alter the terms of one contemporaneously executed contract by reference to another where, as here: (1) the parties to each contract are not the same; (2) the term in the contract in question is not ambiguous; and (3) the term in the other contract is directly conflicting. This is especially so where the result is to require an essential term, such as the duration of the contract, to be amended from the written terms of one contract to obtain consistency between the two contracts. To do so would disrupt the longstanding rule that parties are bound by the unambiguous terms of their written agreement unless it is affected by fraud, mistake or misrepresentation: Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471 , 483-84 [33] and [35]. The terms of the Nepalle Guarantee, including its duration, are not ambiguous. In the absence of such ambiguity, the written document stands on its own as a record of the agreement between the parties to it. </sentence>
