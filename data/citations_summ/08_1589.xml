He did have regard to flagrancy: see [79] above. Next, the G-Star Companies submitted the Federal Magistrate was required to take into account the conduct of Mr Seo prior to 23 December 2009. That conduct was relevant (s 115(4)(b)(ib) of the Copyright Act ) and was at least to some extent taken into account by the Federal Magistrate: see [79] above. It is true that the Federal Magistrate did not refer to the fact that Mr Seo failed to appeal at the directions hearings listed on 19 August 2009 and 4 November 2009 and, in breach of Court orders, failed to file a defence and failed to provide discovery. These facts were said to support an inference that there was "a very strong possibility that the extent of the infringement [was] underestimated": cf Review Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 122 295 836) v New Cover Group Pty Ltd (ACN 111 991 596) [2008] FCA 1589 ; (2008) 79 IPR 236 at [54] --- [62]; Aristocrat Technologies at [53] and [116] and the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum, Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Act 2003 (Cth), para 4 which introduced s 115(4)(ib) of the Copyright Act . </sentence>

However, the applicant adduced no evidence of the damage it allegedly suffered to its reputation by reason of the infringement of its copyright. In previous cases where damage to reputation has been quantified, evidence was usually led to establish (a) the importance of singularity, distinctiveness, quality or some other commercially valuable aspect of reputation to the victim and (b) how, and to what extent, the infringing product or conduct damaged that aspect of the victim's reputation: see Paramount Pictures Corporation v Hasluck (2006) 70 IPR 293 ; [2006] FCA 1431 at [55] ; New Cover[ [6] ] at [44]---[46] and Innovative[ [7] ] at [29]---[31]. [34] What then is the commercially valuable aspect of the applicant's reputation, and how, and to what extent, was this commercially valuable aspect damaged by the conduct of the respondent? At its highest, it was submitted by the applicant that the "iconic" and "exclusive" nature of the Elwood brand was "cheapened" by the production of the infringing products of the respondent.

In their outline of submissions the applicants have referred to cases where additional damages have been awarded in the range of $3million to $50,000. I find an award of $50,000 will serve as a specific deterrent on the respondent as well as a general deterrent to those in their industry who may be tempted.

As the applicants pointed out in their outline of submissions, there is no exact formula to determine the amount of damages for loss of reputation. In previous cases the number of counterfeit garments offered for sale by respondents have ranged from 20 to 28,139 garments: See Crimson SRL &amp; Anor v Claudia Shoes Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (No.7) (2008) ASAL; Elwood Clothing Pty Ltd v Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 633.

In this case, I am satisfied that the applicants' products have a well-defined and strong position in the marketplace and that they are at risk of, and on balance, have suffered a loss of reputation by the sale of these counterfeit garments and that the figure of $35,000 is an appropriate award. In determining that amount, I am conscious of lesser amounts being awarded for loss of reputation in the range of $7500 to $10,000, but this case, in my view, is distinguished from them by the following factors, which cumulatively heighten the real prospect of damage to reputation to a degree not so prevalent in the other cases: the second applicant loses sales of the G-Star products as consumers refuse to pay the higher prices for the G-Star products when similar looking counterfeit "G-Star" products are available in the marketplace for cheaper prices; the second applicant loses customers as they no longer purchase the G-Star products as they are no longer considered "exclusive" as cheaper copy product is available in the marketplace; the second applicant's retail customers no longer wish to purchase the G-Star products as counterfeit "G-Star" products are being sold in retail stores within close proximity to their store and at cheaper prices; and the applicants ensure strict quality control for any product sold under or by reference to the "G-Star" marks and the Urban Culture products are not subject to these controls.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 633">After all, as they say, success breeds success: see Prior v Sheldon [2000] FCA 438 ; (2000) 48 IPR 301 at [87] . While the precise quantification of the Applicant's lost goodwill is necessarily speculative for the reasons identified above, I would award it an additional sum of $10,000 in this regard. That amount represents the best assessment I can make in the circumstances: Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 ; (2008) 79 IPR 236 at [46] . Section 115(4) of the Act --- Additional Damages
  In relation to the "lost profits method", two facts or matters were relied upon by the Applicant: (1) the Respondent sold 31,333 garments and (2) the Applicant sold the NewDeal garment at a wholesale profit of $12.88 per unit. The Applicant had identified a retail profit but conceded, as it had to, that the very great majority of its sales were wholesale. The Applicant accepted that Courts have expressed concerns about the appropriateness of this method: Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 ; (2008) 79 IPR 236 , [42]-[43]. However it submitted that such a method was appropriate in this case because the Applicant could show that it lost significant sales as a result of the Respondent's garments being sold in the marketplace. The Respondent disagreed. It submitted that the Applicant's approach should be disregarded or, if the Court was to award damages on this basis, either the amount awarded should be nominal because the Applicant had failed to satisfactorily quantify its loss ( Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 40 ; (2007) 157 FCR 564 at [2] , and [38]-[39]) or at least heavily discounted.  In the present case, I find that it was reasonably foreseeable that infringement of the Applicant's copyright would cause a loss of reputation to the Applicant in terms of brand-name recognition. However, the Applicant adduced no evidence of the damage it allegedly suffered to its reputation by reason of the infringement of its copyright. In previous cases where damage to reputation has been quantified, evidence was usually led to establish (a) the importance of singularity, distinctiveness, quality or some other commercially valuable aspect of reputation to the victim and (b) how, and to what extent, the infringing product or conduct damaged that aspect of the victim's reputation: see Paramount Pictures Corporation v Hasluck [2006] FCA 1431 ; (2006) 70 IPR 293 at [55] ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 ; (2008) 79 IPR 236 , [44]-[46] and Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74 ; (2008) 166 FCR 358 , [29]-[31]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1941">How then does one assess the overall impression of a design in infringement proceedings? As noted earlier, until recently there has been little Australian judicial consideration of the 2003 Designs Act. The principal cases to date include Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74 ; (2008) 166 FCR 358 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 and World of Technologies (Aust) Pty Ltd v Tempo (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 114 ; (2007) 71 IPR 307.  The "informed user" concept in the 2003 Designs Act has been the subject of recent judicial consideration in Australia: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [19] - [27]; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589. It is a concept the ALRC borrowed from European Community Design law, now codified in Council Regulation (EC) No. 6/2002 and in the Registered Design Act 1949 (UK): see ALRC Report, para 5.17-5.21 and 6.12-6.13; Proctor &amp; Gamble Company v Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd (2007) 73 IPR 605 at [32] and J Choo (Jersey) Ltd v Towerstone Ltd [2008] FSR 19 at [7].  I say "at first glance," however, because in the Review cases, Kenny J added an important qualification to Jessup J's holding in Innovative . Her Honour noted the long-standing common law presumption, codified in s 21(1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), that statutes are to be read as being confined to their operation within territorial limits: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [77] ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 at [48] . Although the Respondents in this case did not raise any extraterritoriality issue, I consider it appropriate to do so because the parties did not have the benefit of Kenny J's judgment at the time of trial and because the issue relates to the Court's jurisdiction - that is, it goes to a matter in respect of which the Court is required to satisfy itself regardless of the parties' submissions or lack thereof. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 1805">1.3 This was not a claim that was bound to fail, or even, more likely than not to fail. 1.4 The result turned upon the judge's impression, which was in favour of the applicants' case up to the point of considering the prior art. 1.5 There was a close similarity between the garment in question in this proceeding and the dresses in Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589. The fact that there was no infringement in this proceeding but infringements in the New Cover proceeding, and taking into account the state of discovery, the limited prior art relied upon at the time of the offer and Redberry's prior instances of copying, it was not unreasonable for the applicants to have considered that Redberry's garments were infringing. 1.6 To have accepted Redberry's offer of compromise at that time would have required the applicants to accept, in effect, that a person in China had independently conceived a design that was startling similar to the applicants' design and at the same time when another retailer --- New Cover Group Pty Ltd --- was also selling a dress remarkably similar to the applicants' design.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1588">69 The applicants also sought general damages on an alternative basis. As I stated in Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 (" New Cover "), in a case of design infringement, general damages may be awarded on the basis of the diminution of the value of the Review Design as a chose in action. The manner in which such damages are to be assessed is discussed in New Cover and applies in this case as well. As in New Cover , there is no satisfactory evidence as to the sales history of the Review Design, but there is some evidence as to the value to Review of its designs and the image they created. Adopting the approach as outlined in New Cover , if it had been necessary to do so, I would have assessed the effect of infringement at the time it occurred (and had it been made out) on the potential market for the Review Dress at $3,500. </sentence>
