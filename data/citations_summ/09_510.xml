<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 361">The requirements imposed by O 11 of the Federal Court Rules in respect to pleadings are no different when an applicant seeks to allege misfeasance than they are for any other cause of action. The function of pleadings remains the same. In Banque Commerciale S.A., en Liquidation v Akhil Holdings Ltd [1990] HCA 11 ; (1990) 169 CLR 279 at 286 Mason CJ and Gaudron J expressed the general principle as follows: 
 
 The function of pleadings is to state with sufficient clarity the case that must be met: ... In this way, pleadings serve to ensure the basic requirement of procedural fairness that a party should have the opportunity of meeting the case against him or her and, incidentally, to define the issues for decision. The rule that, in general, relief is confined to that available on the pleadings secures a party's right to this basic requirement of procedural fairness. Accordingly, the circumstances in which a case may be decided on a basis different from that disclosed by the pleadings are limited to those in which the parties have deliberately chosen some different basis for the determination of their respective rights and liabilities. ... 
 

 
This general statement has been repeatedly cited and applied in this Court: e.g. Cummings v Lewis (1993) 41 FCR 559 at 577 to 578, 113 ALR 285 at 303 per Cooper J; Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2003] FCA 388 at [21] per Sackville J; Travel Compensation Fund v Internova Travel Pty Limited (in liquidation) [2003] FCA 664 at [29] per Bennett J. See also: Wride v Schulze [2004] FCAFC 216 ; Shelton v National Roads and Motorists Association Ltd [2004] FCA 1393 at [20] to [21] per Tamberlin J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Singapore Airlines Cargo Pte Ltd [2009] FCA 510 at [95] , 256 ALR 458 at 472 to 473 per Jacobson J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 136">57 The relevant services are "international air cargo services". They are defined to mean transportation of air cargo between international airports, including between Australia and foreign airports, and they include transportation by international air cargo carriers through "code-sharing" or "interlining arrangements". These are explained in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Singapore Airlines Cargo Pte Ltd (ACN 095 934 857) [2009] FCA 510 ; (2009) 256 ALR 458 at [16] . 70 It is unnecessary to refer in any detail to the decisions of single judges of this Court in which the concept of a global market for air cargo services has been considered: see Riverstone [2002] FCA 1608 , Auskay [2008] FCA 1458 ; 251 ALR 166 and Qantas [2008] FCA 1976 ; 253 ALR 89 ; see also ACCC v Singapore Airlines [2009] FCA 510 ; 256 ALR 458 at [76] ff. </sentence>
