It was later rescheduled for hearing on 2 July 2009. On 19 June 2009 a further request for postponement was made by the applicant. By notice dated 23 June 2009 the Tribunal member refused the applicant's request and advised that a rescheduled hearing would proceed on 2 July 2009. That notice allowed the applicant only six working days between the date of notice and the hearing; one working day less than the notice period prescribed by regulation. The applicant complains that this shortened notice period was unreasonable. However because the hearing was a rescheduled hearing the prescribed period did not have to be given again; Minister for Immigration and Multi-Cultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFML [2006] FCAFC 152 ; (2006) 154 FCR 572 at [76] --- [83]; SZDQO v Minister for Immigration and Multi-Cultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1026 ; (2005) 144 FCR 251 ; and SZEFM v Minister for Immigration and Multi-Cultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78. </sentence>

As was the case before his Honour below, the Minister submitted that the appellant has failed to identify any 'information' for the purposes of s 424A. The reason for the Tribunal's decision was simply the general nature of the appellant's claims and lack of details identifying that the appellant had suffered any harassment, persecution or harm for a Convention related reason. Such matters are thought processes and not within the scope of s 424A(l): SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [18] ; SZEFM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78 at [23] per Bennett J and cases there cited.</sentence>

I note that this was done at the specific request of the applicant husband (and in context, on behalf of the applicant wife).

The Tribunal's reason for affirming the delegate's decision was its inability to reach the requisite level of satisfaction that the statute requires. This was based on its view that what the applicant had provided was lacking in detail. I note that this view of the applicant's claims is not "information" for the purposes of s.424A, and I agree with the Minister's submissions in this regard and note the reference to SZEFM v the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78 , per Bennett J at [23]. </sentence>

Plainly, the reason for the Tribunal's decision was the lack of evidence, that is, the lack of detail provided by the applicant in her claims, such that the Tribunal was not able to reach the requisite mental state of satisfaction that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. In all, therefore, the Tribunal, having complied with its statutory obligation to invite the applicant to a hearing, proceeded to make a decision on the review pursuant to s.426A of the Act when the applicant did not appear at the scheduled time, date and place for the hearing.

In relation to the applicant's claim that the Tribunal did not follow the proper procedure in accordance with the law, I note that this is a case to which s.422B of the Act applies, such that the matters set out in Division 4 of Part 7 of the Act are the exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule (absent bias) ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 and SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs &amp; Anor [2006] FCAFC 62). With that in mind, I note already what I have said in relation to ss.425 , 425A and 426A of the Act and paragraph 13 of the respondent's written submissions, that there was no obligation on the Tribunal pursuant to s.424A(1) of the Act to provide to the applicant in writing the opportunity to comment on information on which the Tribunal relied. Such an obligation is not enlivened in circumstances where the reason for the Tribunal's decision was a lack of evidence or detail such that the Tribunal could reach the requisite level of satisfaction as to whether the applicant's claim of fear of persecution was well-founded. I note the respondent's reference to authorities at paragraph 13 of written submissions and that the respondent is entitled to rely upon these authorities ( SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195 at [29] ; SZEFM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78 at [22] - [23]; SZCIC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1194 at [28] - [29]; SZFWZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238 ; SZIDH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 369). </sentence>

It was, however, open to the Tribunal to adjourn the hearing, consistent with its obligations under the Migration Act (see section 427(1)(b) and SZEFM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78).

<sentence id="cs46" from="[2006] FCA 1140">This issue was also raised by Weinberg J in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2. At [175] - [180], his Honour considered the meaning and significance of the expression "information", and in substance accepted that s 424A(1) required the Courts to draw a distinction between information put forward by an applicant during an initial interview for a visa application and information concerning the same claims given later during a hearing. Although Weinberg J expresses the view that the section draws a somewhat unsatisfactory distinction between, for example, a failure to mention something during an airport statement and the making of an inconsistent statement during later evidence given at a hearing, the discussion of his Honour does indicate that if an applicant repeats an earlier statement at some stage during the course of a hearing, adopts it as true and then subsequently resiles from the statement, the Tribunal is not obliged to afford the applicant an opportunity to comment on the discrepancy: see also Bennett J's discussion of this issue in SZEFM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78. </sentence>

This is because the adoption of the earlier statement brings it within the scope of the s 424A(3)(b) exception.

<sentence id="cs59" from="[2006] FMCA 547">Ms Gray submits that the invitation to attend the rescheduled hearing did not have to comply with the notification required under s.425A and regulation 4.35D , because the Tribunal was acting pursuant to its adjournment powers under s.427(1)(b) of the Act : SZEFM v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 78 per Bennett J; SZDQO v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 1026 at [29] per Conti J.</sentence>

Her Honour applied a remark of the Federal Magistrate in that case that it was clear that the Tribunal had seen itself as exercising its adjournment power in rescheduling when video conferencing facilities were not available due to technical difficulties on the day and at the time appointed for the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs61" from="[2006] FMCA 509">He indicated that he did not wish to attend the Tribunal hearing and, in those circumstances, must be taken as relying on his protection visa claims before the Tribunal and hence to have given such claims to the Tribunal within s.424A(3)(b): see SZEFM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78 at [19] .</sentence>

<sentence id="cs63" from="[2006] FCAFC 2">179 In the same way, the present position can lead to odd results. As can be seen from the appeal in SZEEZ, if an applicant makes a statement during the course of an airport interview that is inconsistent with later evidence given at a hearing, s 424A(1) requires that written notice be given of the possible use of that statement to draw inferences against the applicant. If, however, the applicant repeats the earlier statement at some stage during the course of the hearing, and adopts it as true, and then subsequently resiles from that statement, the Tribunal is not obliged to afford the applicant an opportunity to comment upon the discrepancy: see generally SZEFM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78 per Bennett J. This is because the adoption of the earlier statement brings it within the scope of the s 424A(3)(b) exception. If, however, the Tribunal proposes to use the earlier statement as the "reason", or "a part of the reason" for affirming the decision under review, rather than the later adoption, it must comply with s 424A(1). </sentence>
