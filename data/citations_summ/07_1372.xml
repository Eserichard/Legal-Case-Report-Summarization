<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1491">3 The Notice of Appeal filed on 8 May 2007 purports on its face to be an appeal to the court in its original jurisdiction from a decision of either a 'Professional Services Review Committee' ('the PSR Committee') or a 'Determining Authority' ('the Authority') established in accordance with ss 93 and 95 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) ('the Act') and s 106Q of the Act respectively. For the reasons indicated in Mitchelson v Health Insurance Commission [2007] FCA 1372 , that document entirely fails as a document originating a proceeding as an appeal from a decision of either body, as no appeal lies to the court from such a decision. </sentence>
