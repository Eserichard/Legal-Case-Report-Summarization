<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWSC 1424">50 The Defendant relied on the decision in Wearne v Southern Cross University [2006] FCA 1033 , where Branson J said at [27]:

 
 
 "The University should not be required to sift through a narrative and then a list of complaints, for the purpose of trying to identify the precise manner (or manners) in which it is alleged to have breached the implied term and then categorise the particulars provided accordingly. " </sentence>

147 A view has been expressed that the purpose of s 31A is to introduce a lower standard for summary dismissal and strikeouts under O 20 r 2 and O 11 r 6: cf Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 at [5-8] ; Wearne v Southern Cross University [2006] FCA 1033 at [13] and Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Limited [2006] FCA 1441 at [23] . It is unnecessary for me to decide this issue in the context of this matter. In my view the application of the applicant filed 7 April 2006 can be dismissed in accordance with either s 31A Federal Court Act or O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules , and I should so order. ORDER 
 
 1. The proceedings in QUD130/2006 commenced by application filed 7 April 2006 by the applicant be dismissed. 2. The applicant pay the costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be taxed if not agreed.

 s 31A was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeouts (either of claims or defences) than that previously laid down by the High Court&#180;s decisions in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1948) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130, namely that the allegations are 'so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed'.
