 [23] In Dowling v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd 15 Moore J considered the term 'without reasonable cause' within the context of the same general costs provision of the WR Act as applied to Kangan v AIRC 16 (renumbered as s.824(1)) and stated: 
 
 "52. The words of the s 824(1) of the WR Act require me to consider whether the proceeding was instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause. In answering the question posed by s 824(1), I am required to undertake a qualitative assessment of the proceeding in its entirety, focussing of course on the party that 'instituted' the proceeding (see Australian Workers' Union of Employees, Queensland v Etheridge Shire Council (No 2) [2009] FCA 58 at [27] per Spender J). 53. In considering whether a proceeding was instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause for the purpose of s 824(1) it is necessary to distinguish between the situation where an applicant has merely been unsuccessful on the case he or she has sought to propound and the situation where the applicant's case was entirely misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 268">His Honour says at [52]: "In answering the question posed by section 824(1) [a section similar in form to section 570] I am required to undertake a qualitative assessment of the proceeding in its entirety focusing, of course, on the party that "instituted the proceeding" (see Australian Workers' Union of Employees, Queensland v Etheridge Shire Council (2) (2009 FCA 58 [27]) per Spender J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 95">
 Before the Court is an appeal from orders of a single Judge, Australian Workers' Union of Queensland v Etheridge Shire Council [2009] FCA 58 ("the Costs Judgment"), rendered in consequence of a ruling on an application for the costs of the primary proceeding in which his Honour's reasons are to be found in Australian Workers' Union of Queensland v Etheridge Shire Council [2008] FCA 1268 ; (2008) 171 FCR 102 ("the Primary Judgment"). The question upon which this appeal turns is whether, upon the proper construction of s 824 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the WR Act "), the primary proceeding involved a matter "arising under" the WR Act , so that prima facie each party should have borne its own costs of the primary proceeding. Otherwise, the Court should have exercised the discretion conferred by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Federal Court Act ") which requires consideration of whether to apply the "normal rule" that costs follow the event. </sentence>
