<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 263">All of the parties have pointed to a number of relevant factors of the sort identified by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080. As I said in Ikin v Crown Trading Group Pty Ltd [2009] FMCA 1187 at [3] : "Subject only to the caution expressed by Buchanan J in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Proprietary Limited v McAlary-Smith (2008) FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 at 91 to the effect that the matters identified by Tracey J should not be treated as a rigid catalogue of matters for attention, it is now accepted that Tracey Js approach is correct in the sense that it indicates a number of relevant considerations. I also note the observations of Gyles J in A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2008) FCA 466 at [6] where his Honour said: "There are no mandatory statutory criteria and it is wrong to regard factors seen as relevant by one court as statutory criteria. Indeed, lists of factors can confuse an essentially straightforward task and lead to over-elaborate reasoning. "" </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 284">Of course, adopting an approach that simply applies a checklist can be confusing in some cases or overtake the primary task, which is to look at the whole of the circumstances in the context of the legislative instrument and strike an appropriate penalty for the particular conduct in this particular case involving these particular parties. To some extent, this was discussed in A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466 and Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560.  However, it is the one union and I have regard to the comments made by Jessup J in Williams v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union &amp; Ors [2010] FCA 75 and Gyles J in A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466. Whilst the fact that many of the previous decisions may have involved other branches within the union might have been given more weight in early days, at this point (given the number of previous cases), it seems to be of no significant moment that many of the cases involve other branches of one overall union. Clearly, the union must be aware that there is a significant problem with compliance with the Act throughout its branches. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FMCA 145">In doing so I bear in mind the observations of Giles J in A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466 at [6] : "... the discretion is at large. There are no mandatory statutory criteria and it is wrong to regard factors seen as relevant by one court as statutory criteria. Indeed, lists of factors can confuse an essentially straightforward task and lead to over-elaborate reasoning. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] FCA 56">In addressing the circumstances bearing on his discretion in imposing penalties, the learned Federal Magistrate acknowledged in the Penalty Judgment the various considerations which the authorities indicate as potentially relevant or applicable and specifically noted Tracey J's summary in Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 ; (2008) 177 IR 61 , at [40], of the discretionary factors to be taken into account in relation to conduct like that found to have occurred in the present case. Although he acknowledged that such a list of relevant considerations may be helpful, his Honour correctly observed, at [4] of the Penalty Judgment, that they; 
... are not to be followed in any slavish way ( Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 , per Buchanan J at [91]). As was pointed out by Giles J in A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466 (" Silvestri ") at [6]:
 
 
"The discretion is at large. There are no mandatory statutory criteria, and it is wrong to regard factors seen as relevant by one court as statutory criteria. Indeed, lists of factors can confuse an essentially straightforward task and lead to over-elaborate reasoning. "
 
  The appellants suggested that [29] and [37] of the Penalty Judgment reflect some error on the learned Federal Magistrate's part in regarding the CFMEU's support of Deans as relevant to the assessment of penalties. Mr Borenstein SC contended that there is no principle of sentencing which allows a penalty to be increased because the accused or respondent has contested the case and put the prosecutor to proof. In response to this contention I was referred to A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466 (" Silvestri "), per Gyles J, on which Counsel for the respondent said that the learned Federal Magistrate had specifically relied. In Silvestri , Gyles J observed, at [12]; 
...the CFMEU chose to actively defend the conduct of Lane to the end, notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence marshalled against his version of events. Furthermore, it is hardly sensible to view this incident as the wildcat actions of an aberrant official.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 973">It should be noted that this list is not in any sense a checklist or a formula to be followed (see Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8). I also bear in mind the observations of Giles J in A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Limited v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466 at [6], where his Honour said: "A number of authorities discuss the factors to be taken into account in fixing a penalty, many of them borrowing from related fields, including the criminal law.

On the other hand, counsel for the applicant drew my attention to the following passage in the judgment of Gyles J in A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466 , [13]:
 
 Ultimately, union officials will act in accordance with the policies of the union.

<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] FMCA 272">There is a growing body of authority as to the approach that should be taken in cases such as these. Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 is often referred to, subject to the qualifications set out in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 ("Ophthalmic Supplies") per Buchanan J at [91]. I have had regard to those authorities but would add reference to the following observation of Gyles J in A. &amp; L.

<sentence id="cs19" from="[2009] FMCA 265">The principles that should be applied in the approach to penalty proceedings such as the matter before the Court were not in dispute. Exhibit "A2" essayed those provisions at paragraphs [18]-[20] as follows: "18. The factors relevant to the imposition of a pecuniary penalty in an industrial context, will usually include the following: (a) The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches; (b) The circumstances in which that conduct took place; (c) The nature and extent of any loss or damage sustained as a result of the breaches; (d) Whether there had been similar previous conduct by the respondent; (e) Whether or not the breaches were deliberate; (f) Whether the party committing the breach had exhibited contrition; (g) Whether the party committing the breach had taken corrective action; (h) Whether the party committing the breach had cooperated with the enforcement authorities; (i) The need to ensure compliance with minimum standards by provision of an effective means for investigation and enforcement of employee entitlements; (j) The need for specific and general deterrence; and (k) The application of the "totality principle": see Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 at [18] - [68] inclusive, Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 per Tracey J at [14], Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 246 ALR 35 at [59] - [60] per Graham J and [89] per Buchanan J. 19. Those factors are, however, merely a guide, rather than a "rigid catalogue of matters for attention": Australian Ophthalmic Supplies at [91] per Buchanan J, A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v CFMEU [2008] FCA 466 at [6] per Gyles J. The Court is ultimately required "... to fix a penalty which pays appropriate regard to the circumstances in which the contraventions have occurred and the need to sustain public confidence in the statutory regime which imposes the obligations": Australian Ophthalmic Supplies at [91] per Buchanan J. 20. In CFMEU v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No.2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at [7] - [8], Branson J identified an additional consideration as relevant to the assessment of penalty in freedom of association proceedings, namely, the need in the circumstances, for the protection of industrial freedom of association (albeit in the context of a contravention of Part XA of the WR Act as it existed prior to the amendments made by the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth)) (" the Pre-Reform Act "). " </sentence>
