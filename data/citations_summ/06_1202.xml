<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1363">19 Even if the ground did not require the adducing of further evidence, in the circumstances of this case it would not be in the interests of justice to grant leave. It seems that a similar argument was raised in previous proceedings where it was rejected first by Gyles J ( Applicant S1815 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 1202) and then on appeal by Nicholson J ( Applicant S1815 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2007] FCA 159).  2 The reason for the long delay in finalising this matter was explained at [2] of the Federal Magistrate's decision as follows:
 In August 1997 [the applicant] applied for a protection visa. The application was refused and he sought review by the Tribunal. After the Tribunal decision of 31 May 1999 the applicant sought judicial review by joining the Muin and Lie class action in the High Court of Australia (see Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal; Lie v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601). His application was remitted to the Federal Court of Australia. On 29 August 2006 Gyles J dismissed the application for an order nisi (Applicant S1815 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 1202). Leave to appeal from that decision was refused by Nicholson J (Applicant S1815 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 159). The applicant commenced the present proceedings by application filed in this Court on 20 August 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 653">The Tribunal made its decision on 31 May 1999. The issue of the application of s.424A was considered by Gyles J in connection with the applicant's application for an order nisi (see Applicant S1815 of 2003 [2006] FCA 1202 at [3] ). His Honour rejected a s.424A argument on the basis that the section came into effect the day after the Tribunal's decision. In refusing the application for leave to appeal (see Applicant S1815 of 2003 [2007] FCA 159 at [22] ) Nicholson J found that there was no arguable case for final relief before Gyles J and no error of law in the reasoning of his Honour. The ground raised in the affidavit is not made out. The Tribunal had made its decision and thus exercised its jurisdiction prior to the coming into effect of s.424A and thus was not bound to follow the procedures laid down by that section.  The applicant, a citizen of Pakistan, arrived in Australia in July 1997. In August 1997 he applied for a protection visa. The application was refused and he sought review by the Tribunal. After the Tribunal decision of 31 May 1999 the applicant sought judicial review by joining the Muin and Lie class action in the High Court of Australia (see Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal; Lie v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601). His application was remitted to the Federal Court of Australia. On 29 August 2006 Gyles J dismissed the application for an order nisi ( Applicant S1815 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 1202). Leave to appeal from that decision was refused by Nicholson J ( Applicant S1815 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 159). The applicant commenced the present proceedings by application filed in this Court on 20 August 2007.  The applicant sought to rely on the claimed partial extract from the transcript of the Tribunal hearing in support of a general proposition that the Tribunal had accepted his claims during the hearing but then had rejected them in its decision. Beyond this general assertion he did not point to particular issues that were raised in relation to the conduct of the hearing. On their face his expressed concerns seek merits review. While not expressed in those terms, insofar as the applicant might have been taken to be seeking an adjournment to put further evidence before the Court (such as a complete transcript of the hearing in proper form), I considered this but was not satisfied that it would be in the interests of the parties or the interests of justice to adjourn the hearing. The applicant has had ample opportunity to put a complete transcript before the Court. I note that in his past judicial review proceedings in relation to the same Tribunal decision the applicant had, similarly, unsuccessfully sought to tender a partial extract from the transcript of the Tribunal hearing. (See Applicant S1815 of 2003 v RRT [2006] FCA 1202 at [4] --- [6] and Applicant S1815 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 159 at [17] --- [18]). Failure to investigate claims

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] HCATrans 613">The earlier judgment in question is that of Justice Gyles, the electronic citation of which is [2006] FCA 1202.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 159">The judgment of Gyles J, from which the applicant seeks to appeal, is interlocutory in nature, dismissing an application for an order nisi on the basis that no arguable basis for the grant of final relief has been demonstrated ( Applicant S1815 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 1202 at [9] ). Accordingly, leave to appeal is required: s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The applicant also requires an extension of time to file and serve an application for leave to appeal, because of his failure to make his application within the 7 days prescribed at O 52 r 10(2A)(b) of the Federal Court Rules .
