<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 679">Following the hearing of this matter, the Federal Court in a matter on appeal from this Court handed down its judgment in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 98 ALD 567 ; [2007] FCA 1100 (" SZHLM "). The circumstances before the Court in that case were that the decision made by an earlier constituted Tribunal, following an oral hearing, had been set aside by the Court and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal for redetermination. Upon remittal, the (differently constituted) Tribunal sent two letters to the applicant (described by the Court as " s.424A letters") to which responses were ultimately given. As in the case currently before the Court, the Tribunal did not afford the applicant a second hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCAFC 84">9 Given that the appellant's case was remitted to the Tribunal for a further hearing, an issue might have arisen as to whether it was necessary for the Tribunal to issue a further invitation under s 425 to attend a hearing. We are inclined to the view that no such invitation was required; see NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 at [15] - [32] and SZJHL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1713 at [16] ; cf SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 ; [2007] 98 ALD 567 at [34] . It is not necessary for us to decide that question however as the appellant was invited to the second hearing and did attend. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 712">24 (iv) As was said by the Full Court in SZEPZ at [39]:
 An invalid decision by the Tribunal is no decision at all but it does not follow that all steps and procedures taken in arriving at that invalid decision are themselves invalid. The Tribunal still has before it the materials that were obtained when the decision that had been set aside was made. To the extent that Cowdroy J is properly to be taken as suggesting to the contrary in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 ; (2007) 98 ALD 567 at [34] , his Honour's view ought not be followed in my view.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 657">14 In relation to the third ground of review, the appellant claimed that as she had provided new information to the Tribunal in her response to the s 424A letter, she should have been invited to a further hearing pursuant to s 425 of the Act. Lloyd-Jones FM considered the decision of the High Court of Australia in SAAP and Another v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 228 CLR 294 and the decision of this Court in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100. His Honour considered that it was not clear from these decisions what kind of response to the s 424A letter would trigger an obligation under s 425 of the Act to invite the appellant to a new hearing. However, his Honour was satisfied that as the appellant's response to the s 424A letter did not raise any new issue, no further hearing was required under s 425 of the Act. His Honour accordingly rejected the ground of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 452">Since the hearing of this matter, it has come to the Court's attention that there have been three recent additions which address the issue of whether a reconstituted Tribunal is required to hold its own hearing. This issue was addressed in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 per Buchannan J at [32] handed down on 27 June 2007: SZHLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 per Cowdry J at [34] handed down on 23 October 2007 and NBKM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 per Siopis J at [32] handed down 13 September 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 228">During the hearing in this Court, I raised with Mr Mitchell the impact of the recent decisions in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 at [32] per Buchannan J, SZHLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 at [34] per Cowdroy J and NBKM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 at [32] per Siopis J. At the end of the hearing leave was granted to the parties to file supplementary submissions addressing this issue. Mr Mitchell complied with this request and filed supplementary submissions on 12 December 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 219">However, counsel for the Applicant also submitted that, in any event, in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 (" SZHLM ") Cowdroy J held that a reconstituted Tribunal was required to carry out its function as if the first hearing had not taken place. Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the Tribunal therefore was bound to give the Applicant a fresh invitation to come to a hearing pursuant to s.425 of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 163">I am not sure, however, if the decision of Cowdroy J in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) FCA 1100 takes the principle further than those cases, when referring to SZILQ at [33] and [34]. In [34] in particular, Cowdroy J says this: There is a further consideration. The original decision of the Tribunal, having been set aside had 'no operative effect': see SZILQ (2007) FCA 942 . The reconstituted Tribunal was required to carry out its statutory functions as if the first hearing had not taken place. The Tribunal's duty required it to seek further information under section 424A(1) and in the absence of a finding in favour of the appellant was required to invite the appellant 'to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issue arising in relation to the decision under review' pursuant to section 425 of the Act: see Applicant NAFF of 2002 221 CLR at 26 to 27. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 25">I am conscious of the recent decision of Cowdroy J in SZHLM v Minister [2007] FCA 1100 which was decided on 23 October 2007. In SAAP v Minister [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 228 CLR 294 , the High Court indicated that it can be appropriate for a Tribunal to send a s.424A letter after a hearing. There is no suggestion in SAAP that a response to a post-hearing s.424A letter would require a further hearing. SZHLM did not analyse whether responses to s.424 and 424A letters raise a new issue in the s.425 sense. It seems reasonably clear that the issue in SZHLM was more than a simple comment on information put to the applicant in a s.424A letter. The response was comment on adverse information under s.424A and the request for further information. However, beyond that, the nature of the response said to trigger the obligation to invite the applicant to a new hearing is unclear from SZHLM . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FMCA 2134">Mr Ower, who appears for the applicant, relies on the decision of Cowdroy J in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1100 where his Honour held that in a remitted matter an applicant should have an opportunity to attend at a hearing . SZHLM was a case in which no invitation to attend a hearing had been made. At [32] his Honour stated: "By sending the first and second s.424A(1) letters it was clear that the Tribunal required additional information to enable it to determine the application before it. If after the receipt of such further information the Tribunal was still unable to make a decision favourable to the appellant it had an obligation pursuant to s.425 of the Act to invite the appellant to appear before it. The fact that a previous hearing was held did not discharge this obligation in view of the fact that the Tribunal had requested further information. The Tribunal made its decision in the absence of making further inquiry of Mr Slater as it was invited to do, and without inviting the appellant to appear at a hearing. " 
His Honour concluded that this failure to invite constituted a failure to comply with its statutory obligations by the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2007] FMCA 2091">However, in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 (" SZHLM "), dated 23 October 2007, Cowdroy J at [34] found that a "reconstituted Tribunal was required to carry out its statutory functions as if the first hearing had not taken place. " Cowdroy J is the only authority for the proposition that a reconstituted Refugee Review Tribunal is required to invite an applicant to a hearing. There is no reference in Cowdroy J's decision to NBKM , although SZHLM was decided after NBKM . In the circumstances I do not regard myself as bound by SZHLM and I propose to follow NBKM and SZJHL . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2007] FMCA 2037">I was referred to the opinion by Cowdroy J in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 at [34] that "the reconstituted Tribunal was required to carry out its statutory functions as if the first hearing had not taken place" . This appears contrary to the weight of authority in the Federal Court which I have cited above, and does not address the reasoning of the Full Court in SZEPZ (supra). Perhaps Cowdroy J meant to refer to "first decision" rather than "first hearing". However, in the present case I do not need to decide this, nor whether I should decline to follow his Honour's opinion. </sentence>
