<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 173">This is an application for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal under O 52 r 15(2) of the Federal Court Rules . The applicant taxpayer objected to an assessment made by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in respect of the years of income 2005 and 2006. It brought proceedings challenging the assessment that were heard by the primary judge, who delivered a concise, closely reasoned judgment dismissing the taxpayer's challenge on 23 October 2008: Pre-Paid Professional Administration Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1580. His reasons turned on the construction of documents entered into between the taxpayer and others concerning the character in which the taxpayer held and dealt with moneys that were paid to it. The taxpayer was represented by solicitors and counsel. The hearing extended over four days in late July and early October 2008. His Honour granted an adjournment to the taxpayer of two months to enable it to meet changes which the Commissioner had made in his case. </sentence>
