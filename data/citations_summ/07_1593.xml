<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 942">


 
78 In October 2007 the defendant sought leave to appeal from the security for costs order. In Federal Court proceedings ( Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1593) Buchanan J dismissed the application. At [18] his Honour observed that the defendant was:
 
 
 "...unable to show any error in the exercise of the Federal Magistrate's discretion to order security for costs or the amount of such security. He deprived the FMCA of relevant material which might have been used to assess the extent, if any, of his impecuniosity. Moreover, for the same reason, no serious question arises in the present case of any substantial injustice being occasioned to Mr Croker by reason of the requirement to provide security for costs". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 851">In support of the Application the Applicant has filed an Affidavit which annexes a Draft Notice of Appeal . But that Affidavit fails to comply with r 4(2). It is in inadmissible form but, more relevantly, it is more in the nature of a submission and challenges the factual conclusions made by the Refugee Review Tribunal which affirmed the decision not to grant a protection visa. But such deficiencies may presently be left to one side. Non-compliance with r 4(2) should not, as in other proceedings where an applicant has been unrepresented (e.g. Lawrance v The Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1524 at [26] ; Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1593 at [6] ), of itself necessarily impede a proper consideration of such merits as an application may present. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 264">An appeal from orders of a Federal Magistrate pursuant to s 17A Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth), being a summary judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court (cf observations of Buchanan J in Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1593) , requires leave of this Court pursuant to s 24(1A) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 972">3 Despite a number of attempts by him to litigate those matters of dissatisfaction in the Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal of New South Wales, before the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in the High Court of Australia and in this court, Mr Croker ultimately had proceedings, which he had instituted in this Court, transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court in early 2007. They came before Lloyd-Jones FM, who ordered Mr Croker to provide security for costs of the Commonwealth in the sum of $30,000 by 4.00 pm on 11 September 2007 and Mr Croker was also granted leave to file and serve an amended application by that date. He neither provided the security for costs nor filed any amended pleadings pursuant to the leave granted to him. Instead, before the expiry of the time fixed by the Federal Magistrates Court for those steps to be taken, he filed an application in this Court seeking leave to appeal against those orders. Buchanan J dismissed that application on 17 October 2007: Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1593. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 452">31 On 17 October 2007 the application for leave to appeal against such orders was dismissed by Buchanan J. His Honour also ordered Mr Croker to pay the costs of the application for leave: see Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1593.
