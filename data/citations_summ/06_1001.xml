<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 479">I am fortified in that conclusion because two other judges of the Court who have looked at this intriguing question have reached the same conclusion. The first of those is Collier J in her decision in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1001 ; (2006) 155 FCR 1. There, her Honour had to consider the same question and having looked at the matter in admirable detail, concluded at 22 [150] that the procedure under O 15 r 2(3) applied to general discovery under O 15 r 5. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] VSC 417">27 Norwich accepts that Australian courts have frequently applied [12] a definition of "power" given by Lord Diplock (with whom the other members of the House of Lords agreed) in the context of a dispute about discovery in Lonrho v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd. [13] In its written submissions Norwich refers to the following passage from Lonrho as containing that definition: 
 
 
 ".... the expression 'power' must, in my view, mean a presently enforceable legal right to obtain from whoever actually holds the document inspection of it without the need to obtain the consent of anyone else. Provided that the right is presently enforceable, the fact that for physical reasons it may not be possible for the person entitled to it to obtain immediate inspection would not prevent the document from being within his power ... . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1556">The applicants in their written submissions conceded the general principle that costs follow the event, and that subject to consideration of a number of issues the applicants are not in a position to argue against an order that they pay the respondents' costs in these proceedings, including reserved costs. 2. On 4 August 2006 I made orders determining two notices of motion, one brought by each party, concerning further disclosure ( Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1001). Each party had success on its motion. I reserved the costs of both notices of motion, and the applicants submit that no costs order should be made on either notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1201">62 In consenting to an order requiring general discovery, it is not understood that the parties are merely consenting to an order requiring the discovery of only those documents as are contemplated by O 15 r 2(3): Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1001 at [153] , [2006] FCA 1001 ; 155 FCR 1 at 22---3 per Collier J. It is understood that the parties are consenting to what was described by Beaumont J as an order in the " traditional form " requiring discovery of those documents which " may " -- not " must " -- either directly or indirectly enable a party to advance its own case or damage that of his adversary: Reading Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Birch Carroll &amp; Coyle Ltd [2002] FCAFC 109. Beaumont J there observed:
 [64] In their traditional form, rules of court required, under a general discovery order, that the party disclose any document in its possession, custody or control "relating to any matter in question" in the proceeding; that is to say, any document which may -- not which must -- either directly, or indirectly, enable the party requiring the discovery either to advance its own case, or to damage the case of its adversary, or which may fairly lead to a train of inquiry which may have either of those two consequences (see, eg Compagnie Financi&egrave;re et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano Co (1882) 11 QBD 55 at 62---63).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 1820">
 

3 These criteria under r 2(3) supersede the "train of inquiry" test as the usual requirements for discovery: Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 2 ) [2006] FCA 1001 at [145] .</sentence>
