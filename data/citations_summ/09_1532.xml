<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] HCA 8">" 
 The trial judge and the Full Court 

 
 28 The petroleum defendants and the State of Queensland sought summary dismissal of the plaintiffs' claim under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court Act on the ground that the application had no reasonable prospects of success [16] . The petroleum defendants also submitted that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the application. 
 On 18 December 2009 the primary judge acceded to the applications of the petroleum defendants and the State of Queensland [17] . On 17 March 2010 he made a costs order against the plaintiffs [18] . The plaintiffs sought leave to appeal against the primary judge's orders. But the order dismissing the whole of the proceedings summarily was not justifiable if there were reasonable prospects of success in relation to the first declaration. The primary judge held that the Federal Court did not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the plaintiffs' application because it was "a paradigm example of an impermissible attempt to secure an advisory opinion. " [20] He continued:
 
 
 "What is revealed is nothing more than a difference in contractual negotiating positions between the [plaintiffs], who claim in other proceedings, but have not yet been determined to hold, native title in respect of the claimed land and [the petroleum defendants] who may [one] day seek to obtain from the state a petroleum lease in respect [of] part of the claimed land on the strength of [the ATP]. It is not pleaded that any such lease has been granted or is even imminently to be granted. " 
 
 
 The primary judge also said of the plaintiffs [21] : 

 
 
 "Their mere status as a registered native title claimant does not ... give them standing to claim any of the relief sought, including any part which relies only on state law. It is not pleaded that any such lease has been granted or is even imminently to be granted. " 
 
 
 The primary judge also said of the plaintiffs [21] : 

 
 
 "Their mere status as a registered native title claimant does not ... give them standing to claim any of the relief sought, including any part which relies only on state law. " 
 
 
 The primary judge saw the claims under the NTA as "obviously doomed to fail", and hence as "colourable" and "not genuine" [22] . 

 The Full Court considered that the primary judge's decision was not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant granting leave to appeal. 
 Two approaches to the controversy 

 The conclusion reached by the primary judge, not disturbed by the Full Court, was incorrect for the following reasons. " [20] He continued:
 
 
 "What is revealed is nothing more than a difference in contractual negotiating positions between the [plaintiffs], who claim in other proceedings, but have not yet been determined to hold, native title in respect of the claimed land and [the petroleum defendants] who may [one] day seek to obtain from the state a petroleum lease in respect [of] part of the claimed land on the strength of [the ATP]. It is not pleaded that any such lease has been granted or is even imminently to be granted. " 
 
 
 The primary judge also said of the plaintiffs [21] : 

 
 
 "Their mere status as a registered native title claimant does not ... give them standing to claim any of the relief sought, including any part which relies only on state law. " 
 
 
 The primary judge saw the claims under the NTA as "obviously doomed to fail", and hence as "colourable" and "not genuine" [22] . 

 The Full Court considered that the primary judge's decision was not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant granting leave to appeal. The October 2006 agreement was not relied on before the primary judge. It was relied on for the first time in this Court. The parties, including the petroleum defendants, invited the primary judge to assume the factual correctness of the plaintiffs' case as alleged in the amended statement of claim [33] . To invite this Court to take the October 2006 agreement into account is to depart from that agreed position without warrant. If the petroleum defendants thought that the October 2006 agreement were fatal to the plaintiffs' case as presented, the appropriate course would have been to plead the October 2006 agreement in their defence --- a document which they never filed --- and debate its significance either on a summary judgment application or, more satisfactorily, at a trial. That valuation of over $20m might collapse if the extensions of the ATP were not valid. And if the valuation collapsed, the plaintiffs' prospects of obtaining a gift of the Pastoral Leases would improve. Contrary to what the primary judge said in a different context, the claim of the plaintiffs to challenge the ATP extensions did not depend on the plaintiffs actually having native title [23] . The new ILUA could be concluded and have the statutory effect given it by the NTA irrespective of whether the plaintiffs had obtained or would obtain a determination that native title exists. 
 Standing, hypothetical questions, advisory opinions, jurisdiction 

 The circumstances just summarised raise the following questions, which cannot be wholly disentangled.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCAFC 30">As to the issue of the making of the declaration, the appellants contend: --- (i) the existence of a "registered native title claimant" immediately before the grant of the mining leases could be relevant to the validity of the mining leases only if the grant of those leases was a future act, being an act that affects native title, (ii) for this reason the respondents did not impugn the validity of the mining leases and cannot do so unless and until a determination of native title in respect of the land to which the mining leases relate is made, and (iii) accordingly, the status of any registered native title claimant as such immediately before the grant of the mining leases was hypothetical (see, by analogy, Edwards v Santos Ltd [2009] FCA 1532 ; (2009) 263 ALR 473 and Edwards v Santos Ltd [2010] FCAFC 64 ; (2010) 185 FCR 280 ; and, as to applicable principle, Bass v Permanent Trustee Company Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 334 ; [1999] HCA 9 at [49] and Allphones Retail Pty Ltd v Weimann [2009] FCAFC 135 at [81] ( Allphones v Weimann )).

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1246">The applicant may agitate the issues raised in this proceeding before the Minister in the exercise of his discretion, and upon an unfavourable outcome, he is entitled also to seek a review of that decision. However, the declarations sought by the applicant may not be used as a 'staging post' in the extradition process, to the end of an assertion in the future of certain rights or entitlements: see Edwards v Santos Ltd [2009] FCA 1532 ; (2009) 263 ALR 473 at [56] --- [57] (Logan J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 900">The respondents relied particularly upon the case of Edwards v Santos Ltd [2009] FCA 1532 ; (2009) 263 ALR 473 ( Edwards ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCAFC 64">1 The applicants in this matter seek leave to appeal from orders (Principal Orders) of Logan J made on 18 December 2009: [2009] FCA 1532. His Honour dismissed the applicants' application pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The applicants also appeal from costs orders adverse to them made on 17 March 2010. The costs were those of the first and third respondents "of and incidental to the application, including the summary judgment application".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 238">In December 2009, for reasons which I then published, I ordered that the application made by the applicants be dismissed: Edwards v Santos Limited [2009] FCA 1532. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 34">In December 2009 his Honour Logan J delivered judgment in Edwards v Santos Limited [2009] FCA 1532. In that judgment his Honour found against the applicants before him, who are also the applicants to the notice of motion before me. Those applicants have filed an amended notice of motion seeking leave to appeal against his Honour's decision. However at the hearing before me last Friday the applicants pressed only for two orders, namely: A direction under O 52 r 2AA(a) of the Federal Court Rules that the application for leave to appeal be referred to a Full Court; and A direction that, subject to any contrary direction of the Full Court, the application for leave to appeal be heard concurrently with, or alternatively, immediately before the appeal.  At the substantive judgment Logan J observed that the institution of the substantive proceedings originated from a difference of opinion between the applicants on the one hand, and the first and third respondents on the other, in the course of negotiations between them concerning the making of an Indigenous Land Use Agreement, as to whether the issuing of petroleum leases would constitute pre-existing rights based acts for the purposes of Pt 2 Div 3 Subdiv 1 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth). His Honour also noted that a related controversy was whether any such petroleum leases would then not be subject to the "right to negotiate" provisions of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ( Edwards v Santos Limited [2009] FCA 1532 at [8] ). </sentence>
