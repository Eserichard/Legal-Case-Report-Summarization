<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] AATA 247">Under s 155AA(5) of the VE Act, the Principal Member "must" dismiss the application to the VRB if the requisite written statement has not been provided within the 28 day period provided for in s 155AA(4). In Johnson v Veterans' Review Board (2005) 88ALD 652 at [66] Lander J decided that the power in s 155AB(5) (which is in terms identical for present purposes with s 155AA(5)), is mandatory and must be exercised when the circumstances giving rise to it exist. A similar conclusion was reached by Madgwick J in Rodda v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 1689 ; (2006) 156 FCR 227 at [55] , where his Honour accepted the Commission's argument that a requirement in s 155AC(2) for an authorisation of another person to represent an applicant "must" be in writing was a mandatory obligation, as was the obligation on the Principal Member to dismiss the application for review if a response had not been received within 28 days. His Honour further accepted that s 155AC(2) did not permit substantial compliance. </sentence>
