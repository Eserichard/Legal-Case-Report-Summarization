<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 48">Mr Johnston had submitted that the Court had no jurisdiction to order that he pay the liquidator's costs as he was a 'non-party'. Reliance was placed on the statutory provisions of s 43 FCA and on s 1335(2) CA and r 11.10 of the Federal Court (Corporations) Rules 2000 (Cth). Siopis J rejected the argument that the broad jurisdiction conferred on the Court by s 43 FCA was fettered in any way by the provisions of s 1335(2) CA. Siopis J followed Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Ltd v Hardel Investments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 399 ; (2009) 176 FCR 348 per Lander J noting (at [16] --- [18]): 
 
 16 The Court, in the case of Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Ltd v Hardel Investments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 399 ; (2009) 176 FCR 348 ( Consolidated Byrnes ), considered a similar argument to that which is raised by Mr Johnston as to the construction of s 43 of the Federal Court Act and s 1335(2) of the Corporations Act . Lander J found that s 1335(2) was not intended to limit the jurisdiction of this Court described in s 43(1) of the Federal Court Act to make costs orders in respect of proceedings before the Court brought under the Corporations Act . 
 

 
 
 17 Lander J reached this conclusion after closely examining the existing authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1119">It was, Mr Crutchfield said, not only unnecessary but improper for the deed administrators to provide such detailed guidance. Further, as they had determined to send the material, it would be necessary for any person opposing that course to be made a party and to bring an appropriate application, probably under s 1321 of the Act. (For a recent discussion of the relationship between Rule 2.13 of the Corporations Rules , s 1335(2) of the Act and O 6 r 8 of the Federal Court Rules , see Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited v Hardel Investments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 399 ; (2009) 176 FCR 348. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 321">The observations of Debelle J in Boscaini v Kensington were applied in Draycott v Minister for Environment and Conservation [2006] SASC 384 at [9] (by Debelle J); Danielsen v Waldowski [2008] SASC 27 at [16] and Residential Property Conveyancers v Bagnato [2009] SASC 71 at [25] to [29]. The qualification in Boscaini v Kensington was rejected by Lander J in Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Ltd v Hardel Investments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 399 ; (2009) 176 FCR 348 at [359] . Lander J addressed the question of costs by formulating three questions, all of which were directed to whether the parties had acted reasonably at relevant points along the continuum of the particular proceedings, and said at [359] and [360]: The three questions I have posed mean that I disagree with respect with Debelle J's decision in [ Boscaini v Kensington ]. A party may behave so unreasonably in the bringing or conducting of proceedings so that an order for costs against that party is required in the interests of justice without ever deciding whether the party had a good cause of action. Finkelstein J cast some doubt on the third principle referred to by Hill J. I do not need to decide whether I agree with the proviso mentioned by Finkelstein J because, in my opinion, at the very least this is one case where the issues are sufficiently clear, in the absence of a hearing, for orders for costs to be made. </sentence>

 Depending on circumstances, where the applicant has acted reasonably in commencing proceedings, has an arguable case, and it is reasonable to conclude that the respondent has acted in consequence of the commencement of proceedings, the court may be prepared to make an order as to costs in favour of the applicant.

The exercise of jurisdiction under s 1335(2) is unfettered. The section contains wide power to award costs in proceedings. The powers conferred by it have been exercised in a wide variety of situations including making an order that a non party be added as a party and that indemnity costs be award against him: Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited v Hardel Investments Pty Limited (2009) FCA 399. The section is not to be seen as the Court's source of jurisdiction to make costs orders in Corporations matters. That jurisdiction comes from s 98 Civil Procedure Act 2005 .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 400">These reasons which relate to the costs of the proceeding should be read in conjunction with the reasons given today in Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited ACN 111 052 585 v Hardel Investments Pty Limited ACN 083 276 000 [2009] FCA 399. Those proceedings were brought on 28 March 2008 by Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited (CBH) and Alpha Asset Group Pty Ltd (Alpha) to wind up Hardel Investments Pty Limited (Hardel) and Avpri Pty Limited (Avpri) (the winding up proceedings). CBH and Alpha relied upon the presumption of insolvency created in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Corporations Act ) when a "corporation had failed to comply with a statutory demand served upon it": s 459C(2)(a). </sentence>
