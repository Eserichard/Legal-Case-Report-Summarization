<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 1491">156 Mr Glasson referred to Peter Hanne &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Village Life Limited [2008] FCA 719 , where Jacobson J set aside a notice to produce which had been served in aid of a paragraph in a statement of claim which was his Honour had considered to be very general and liable to be struck out and to the reference there by Jacobson J (at [35] - [45]) to the observations of Young J (as his Honour then was) in Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Ltd [2006] FCA 944 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 435 , at [37] concerning pleadings of a high level of generality.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 253">No appeal is available, except by special leave to the High Court. 
 

 
The view their Honours took of the question of election (i.e. that it is, in truth, an election to be made by the Court, albeit that a party's expressed preference may bear upon the question) has since been regarded as the correct one: see Kristoffersen v Department of Employment, Workplace Relations &amp; Small Business [2002] FCAFC 269 , especially at [13]ff, per Drummond J, with whom Cooper and Dowsett JJ agreed, and Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Limited [2006] FCA 944 , per Young J, at [23]-[27], and the authorities to which his Honour there refers. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1726">15 In determining whether leave should be granted, the Court is required to determine whether, in all the circumstances, the decision sought to be appealed from is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court and secondly whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the decision to be wrong: see Sharp &amp; Anor v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation &amp; Ors (1988) 88 ATC 4184 ; Decor Corporation Pty Ltd and Another v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 ; Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd and Others v Concept Sports Ltd and Others [2006] FCA 944 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 435 at 440-441.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 819">14 In considering an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment the Court is required to consider whether the decision sought to be appealed from is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by this Court and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong: see Sharp &amp; Anor v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation &amp; Ors (1988) 88 ATC 4184 ; Decor Corporation Pty Ltd and Another v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 ; Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd and Others v Concept Sports Ltd and Others [2006] FCA 944 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 435 at 440-441.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 820">28 In considering an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment the Court is required to consider whether the Federal Magistrate's decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by this Court and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong: see Sharp &amp; Anor v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation &amp; Ors (1988) 88 ATC 4184 ; Decor Corporation Pty Ltd and Another v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 ; Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd and Others v Concept Sports Ltd and Others [2006] FCA 944 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 435 at 440-441.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 719">34 This principle is no less applicable today. It was reiterated by Young J in Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Ltd [2006] FCA 944 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 435 at [34] --- [35].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 617">95 In considering an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment the Court is required to consider whether the decision sought to be appealed from is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong (see Sharp &amp; Anor v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation &amp; Ors (1988) 88 ATC 4184 ; Decor Corporation Pty Ltd and Another v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 ; Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd and Others v Concept Sports Ltd and Others [2006] FCA 944 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 435 at 440-441). In Sharp &amp; Anor v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation &amp; Ors (1988) 88 ATC 4184 Burchett J observed at 4,186:
 
 In my opinion, the sufficiency of the doubt in respect of the decision and the question of substantial injustice should not be isolated in separate compartments. They bear upon each other, so that the degree of doubt which is sufficient in one case may be different from that required in another. Ultimately, a discretion must be exercised on what may be a fine balancing of considerations. 

Such observations were adopted by the Full Court in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd and Another v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 399. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 2024">42 As was observed by Young J in Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Ltd [2006] FCA 944 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 435 at [35] ---[37] a cause of action can be pleaded at different levels of generality depending on the nature of the case and the subject matter and most pleadings set forth the material facts at a level which involves some element of conclusion. However, broad conclusions asserted at such a high level of generality that the opposite party cannot understand the case he or she has to meet are not sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] FCA 1810">Where the decision in question concerns a matter of practice and procedure, rather than substantive rights, the Court will ordinarily be very reluctant to grant leave to appeal: Cadence Asset Management Pty Limited v Concept Sports Pty Limited [2006] FCA 944 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 435 at 441 per Young J ( Cadence 58 ACSR). An appeal from a discretionary decision by a trial judge itself attracts special principles, the test being whether the primary judge's discretion miscarried, by reason of some error of principle: Cadence 58 ACSR at 22 and the authorities there cited. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2006] FCA 1716">14 The relevant principles on what comprise proper pleadings are, with respect, well summarised by Young J in Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Ltd [2006] FCA 944 at [34] - [37] where he said:
 
 'I do not read Finkelstein J's reasons for decision as departing from the application of the correct legal principles. Pleadings are a means to an end, and not an end in themselves: Banque Commerciale S.A. , En Liquidation v Akhil Holdings Ltd [1990] HCA 11 ; (1990) 169 CLR 279 ('Akhil') at 293 per Dawson J. Their essential function is to state with sufficient clarity the case that must be met, so as to ensure the basic requirement of procedural fairness: Akhil at 286 per Mason CJ and Gaudron J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2006] NSWADTAP 45">11 A 'substantial injustice' can take a variety of forms --- and includes matters which have since the inception of the Appeal Panel been recognised as permitting immediate exercise of the leave discretion, such as fresh evidence of significance and obvious errors in the content of orders. The emphasis on demonstration of substantial injustice is a typical feature of the way leave discretions in the superior courts relating to interlocutory appeals are exercised: see recently, for example, Cadence Asset Management v Concept Sports Ltd [2006] FCA 944 at [20] to [22] per Young J. While this is not an appeal on an interlocutory question, consideration of whether a substantial injustice would arise if leave was not granted provides a useful way of approaching the exercise of the discretion on this occasion. </sentence>
