<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWADT 161">With respect to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal it has been held that that Tribunal is "plainly entitled to control the hearing and to limit examination or cross-examination so as to ensure some semblance of relevance to the real issues": Lawrence v.

Lawrance v Chief Executive Officer, CRS Australia [2006] FCA 341 per Justice Jacobson. His Honour dismissed the appeal with costs. The applicant had argued that she should not to have to pay costs because the respondents had behaved unreasonably, that her claim was made in the public interest and that her case involved her personal liberty.</sentence>

 7. The applicant has had the opportunity to present, on a merits appeal to an independent tribunal, her challenge to a "nil return" response to her requests under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth), in relation to documents which essentially appear to me to be the same documents that she is now seeking discovery of under most of the paragraphs relevant to the general government agencies who are respondents to this present application. The decisions of the AAT were upheld respectively in Lawrance v Centrelink [2005] FCA 1318 and Lawrance v Chief Executive Officer, CRS Australia [2006] FCA 341. It appears to me that there is little prospect that an order for discovery is likely to be more fruitful than the administrative processes pursued by the applicant, and I consider that it would be oppressive and unjustified to require the respondents to repeat their searches.
