<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 626">In the present case, counsel for the Applicant submitted that pursuant to s 1321 of the Act, the Court should reverse the decision of the First Respondent to refuse to exercise his casting vote, order that the Respondents be removed as the liquidators of the Company and, in their stead, appoint Mr Slattery as the Company's liquidator. In support of that application, Counsel for the Applicant relied upon the following facts and matters: the Applicant accounted for 99.8% of the Company's indebtedness and was the only truly independent creditor: see [6] above. CIA was a related entity of the Company and there was no material before the Court concerning the relationship, if any, between DLC Consultants and Mr Turner; the Applicant was willing to provide an indemnity to Mr Slattery but not to the current liquidators --- the Respondents; although the Code was not the law, it was permissible to test performance of the First Respondent against the Code (eg Gould v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2009] FCA 475 at [49] and Dean-Willcocks v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2006] FCA 555 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 698 at [21] - [34] ) and the First Respondent did not properly comply with it because he did not properly turn his mind to how the casting vote was to be exercised consistent with the matters identified in the Code. Of particular significance was the alleged failure of the First Respondent to turn his mind to the matters set out in paras 1 and 2 above. 
The Applicant did not challenge the Respondents' competency or their independence. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] HCA 23">Of the words "proper" and "adequate" as they appear here, Tamberlin J said in Dean-Willcocks v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board [13] that they invite: 

 
"the testing of performance against a relevant standard or benchmark of performance. Against that background, in Dean-Willcocks , Tamberlin J went on to observe that par (d)(ii) of s 1292(2) [15] : 

 
"is designed to enable a board representative of the commercial and accounting communities to consider whether the function has been adequately and properly carried out.</sentence>
