<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 327">( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Virgin Mobile Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1239). The question of which District Registry should conduct the proceedings does not raise matters of high principle. Essentially it is a matter of case management and proper recognition of the legitimate interests of each of the parties reflected in the balance of convenience as between them and the convenience of the Court and any economies and efficiencies which may attach to one choice or the other ( Lamb v Hog's Breath Company Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 49). There may be flexibility --- one Registry could conduct pre-trial management while allocating the trial to a judge in another Registry ( Hog's Breath at [10]). There is no burden of proof governing the exercise of the discretion in s 48 of the Act ( National Mutual 19 FCR 155 at 162).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1360">In Lamb v Hog's Breath Company Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 49 at [7] , French J (as his Honour then was) observed: 
 
 The question of the Registry from which proceedings should be conducted does not raise matters of high principle. It is essentially a matter of case management and proper recognition of the legitimate interests of each of the parties reflected, in part, in the balance of convenience as between them and, of course, the convenience of the Court and any economies and efficiencies that may attach to one choice or the another.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 956">That is not a reason for transferring the proceeding at this stage. In my view the considerations which informed the decision of French J in Lamb v Hogs' Breath Co Pty Ltd (No. 1) [2007] FCA 49 are (with some changes to place names and a minor omission) equally apposite in the present circumstances. His Honour said (at [9]-[11]) that: 
 
 "[9] ... So far as the interlocutory processes are concerned, unless some unusual circumstances occur, it matters little whether the proceeding is in the Perth or [Melbourne] Registry because in either event the party not in the home Registry will be able to participate by way of video-link or even teleconference.</sentence>
