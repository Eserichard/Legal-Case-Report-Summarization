<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 588">The nature of O 46 r 7A has been the subject of previous consideration by the Courts. It now appears to be the position, given previous decisions of this Court, that the decision of a judge under O 46 r 7A is administrative in character and subject to judicial review under the ADJR Act: see Satchithanantham v National Australia Bank Ltd [2010] FCAFC 47 ; (2010) 268 ALR 222 at [38] --- [50]; Manolakis v District Registrar, South Australia District Registry, Federal Court of Australia [2008] FCAFC 162 ; (2008) 170 FCR 426 at [22] ; Bizuneh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 42 ; (2003) 128 FCR 353 at [16] --- [19] and Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1556 at [16] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1171">There is authority in this Court to the effect that a mere direction by a Judge of this Court to a Registrar of this Court pursuant to O 46 r 7A(2) (and its predecessor rule) is not a judgment of this Court able to be subjected to appeal by a person whose document has been rejected by a Registrar pursuant to the direction given by the Judge (see Bizuneh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 42 ; (2003) 128 FCR 353 at [11] ---[19] (pp 356---357) (per Lee, Whitlam and Jacobson JJ); Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1556 at [16] (per Gordon J); and Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1717 at [58] (per Lander J). See also Legal Aid Commission (WA) v Edwards (No 2) [1982] FCA 103 ; (1982) 61 FLR 419 ; 42 ALR 154 which is not directly in point but which contains reasoning to the same effect). In Bizuneh [2003] FCAFC 42 ; 128 FCR 353 , the Full Court said (at [15]) (p 357), that a rule substantially in the same form as the current rule " removed a clog on the Registrar's discretion ". The Full Court said that the Registrar can now act to refuse to accept or issue a document without first obtaining the authority from a Judge so to act. This power is intended to enable the Registrar to maintain the efficient operation of the Registry and thus, of the Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 162">18 In Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1556 at [16] Gordon J relied on Bizuneh to conclude that a direction under O 46 r 7A is not a judgment from which an appeal may be brought. Lander J took the same view when dismissing an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of Gordon J ( Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1717 at [58] ). See also Bienstein v Family Court of Australia [2008] FCA 1138 per Gray J at [72]-[74].
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 417">10 An appeal to this Court does not operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under the judgment appealed: Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth), O 52, r 17. The " general principle " applied in this Court is that an appeal does not operate as a stay: Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1377 at [6] (Appl'd: Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1556 at [8] ). But s 29(1)(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) does confer a discretionary power to make an order suspending the operation of an order previously made. That subsection provides as follows:
 
 Stay of proceedings and suspension of orders 
 (1) Where an appeal to the Court from another court has been instituted: 
 ... 
 (b) the Court or a Judge may, by order, on such conditions (if any) as it or he or she thinks fit, suspend the operation of an injunction or other order to which the appeal, in whole or in part, relates. </sentence>
