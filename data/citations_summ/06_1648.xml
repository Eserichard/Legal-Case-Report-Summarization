<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] SAWLRP 3">In Sperandio v. Lynch [2006] FCA 1648 at [91] in respect of a relevantly identical provision of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 before its amendment, Jessup J said:
 
"'For an employer to act in breach of the provision, there must be an awareness that the absence was because of illness or injury, and the absence must be the reason for the termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 715">In Sperandio v Lynch [2006] FCA 1648 at [91] it was said of the predecessor provision to that presently under consideration: "91. Turning to s.170CK(2) of the Act, the "reason" to which that provision refers is, I consider, the temporary absence from work. For an employer to act in breach of the provision, there must be an awareness that the absence was because of illness or injury, and the absence must be the reason for the termination. Or, to put it defensively, an employer will succeed in avoiding an adverse finding under the provision upon proving either that he or she did not know the reason for the absence or that he or she did not terminate the employment by reason of the absence. In the present case the respondents have not proved either: indeed, I find the contrary in each case. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 571">Sperandio v Lynch [2006] FCA 1648 is also a case which also concerned a claim of unlawful termination on the basis of temporary absence due to illness or injury. Jessup J's reasons at [87-90] are, in my view, instructive in the context of this particular matter. "87. In Sperandio v Lynch [2006] FCA 1648 at [91] it was said of the predecessor provision to that presently under consideration: "91. Turning to s.170CK(2) of the Act, the "reason" to which that provision refers is, I consider, the temporary absence from work.

Or, to put it defensively, an employer will succeed in avoiding an adverse finding under the provision upon proving either that he or she did not know the reason for the absence or that he or she did not terminate the employment by reason of the absence. In the present case the respondents have not proved either: indeed, I find the contrary in each case. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 152">Crown did not dismiss Mr Anderson because he was absent from work because of a temporary illness. Crown dismissed Mr Anderson because he had misconducted himself as they saw it. In Sperandio v Lynch [2006] FCA 1648 at [91] in respect of a relevantly identical provision of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 before its amendment, Jessup J said: "For an employer to act in breach of the provision, there must be an awareness that the absence was because of illness or injury, and the absence must be the reason for the termination. " </sentence>

I gave the parties leave to file written submissions on the question of costs. They did so, the most recent submissions having been filed on 2 March 2007. These reasons deal with the parties' submissions on costs as so filed. </sentence>

I required the parties to file and serve minutes of the orders which they proposed to give effect to my reasons, with supporting calculations and a note of their submissions.
