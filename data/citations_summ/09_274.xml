<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1378">Ms Wells relies on the judgment of Greenwood J in Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union v John Holland Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 274 (" John Holland "). John Holland is the only judgment, of which the parties are aware, which concerns the operation of s 728 of the WR Act. Ms Wells relies, in particular, on [45] which says the following: 
 
 The pleading asserts conduct on the part of Mr Sasse in his capacity as an employee of John Holland and in every relevant sense he was acting within the scope of his authority. It is not said that the conduct of Mr Sasse gave rise to a contravention by John Holland. The pleading asserts that Mr Sasse aided, abetted, counselled and procured the contravention of the sections by John Holland. In order to establish that case, the pleading must assert as material facts that Mr Sasse was sufficiently aware of all of the relevant facts going to the contravention by the company, that is, intentional participation. In this case, it must be established that Mr Sasse had knowledge that the permit holders enjoyed a right of entry and notwithstanding that knowledge, he set about engaging in the contravening conduct. To form the requisite intent he must have had "knowledge of the essential matters which go to make up the offence whether or not he knows that those matters amount to a crime"... 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1192">The circumstances in which the conduct took place have been summarised above. On two separate dates the respondents refused and/or unduly delayed entry of union officials to premises for the purposes of holding discussions with employees in circumstances where they were entitled to hold such discussions and where, between the first and second occasions on which this occurred, the applicants had endeavoured to resolve the dispute about the right of entry in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The ability of union officials to enter premises to hold discussions is critical to promoting freedom of association (an object of the WR Act see ss.3(j)) (and see Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union v John Holland Pty Limited ACN 004 282 268 (2009) 180 IR 350 ; [2009] FCA 274 at [12] in relation to the objects of Part 15 of the WR Act). </sentence>
