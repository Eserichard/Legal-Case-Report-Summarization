<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 42">The trial judge identified the following principles as presently relevant: The kind of community service referred to in s 50-10 is a practical or tangible help, benefit or advantage conferred on the community or an identifiable section thereof: Navy Health Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 931 ; (2007) 163 FCR 1 at [83] and [84]; Victorian Women Lawyers' Association Inc v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 983 ; (2008) 170 FCR 318 at [163] and [164]. A service provided for reward is not a community service, at least where there is no element of subsidisation: Navy Health at [83]. Community service purposes include the purpose of providing a community service, although the purposes contemplated are not limited solely to the act of provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 679">The proposed partnership has satisfied the test of the Queensland legislation for a limited partnership however the ITAA 1997 poses its own tests. Thus, relevantly [5] there must be "an association of persons ... with legal personality separate from those persons that was formed solely for the purpose of becoming an ESVCLP ... and to carry on activities that are carried on by a body of that kind. " Innovation Australia refers to the discussion of what is meant by "association" in Kibby v Registrar of Titles [6] and in Navy Health Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [7] .  To similar effect the observations of Jessup J in Navy Health [9] 
"On any natural reading of the word, 'association' denotes a grouping, or coming together, of two or more persons. Relevantly for present purposes, the dictionary meaning of the word is 'a body of persons who have combined to execute a common purpose or advance a common cause ...' ( Oxford English Dictionary (2 nd ed)). Unless required to decide otherwise by authority, I consider that the proposition that a single person, whether or not incorporated, might constitute an 'association' is quite at odds with the natural meaning of the word, and with normal, everyday, usage. "
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 862">In Navy Health Jessup J approached the interpretation of "community services" this way: [2007] FCA 931 ; (163 FCR 1 at 33 [83] ): 
 
 Although a composite expression, I consider that the essence of "community service" is that a service is provided to the community, or a section of the community. Here the word "service" is used in the sense of "help, benefit or advantage", particularly "the action of serving, helping or benefiting, conduct tending to the welfare or advantage or another" ( Oxford English Dictionary (2 nd ed)). 
 
 
  I approach these points as part of the interpretative material available to construe the words of the statute. They are not, however, the sole materials and they cannot dictate the meaning of s 50 - 10 to this Court. Like Jessup J, who considered the same explanatory memorandum in Navy Health Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 931 ; (2007) 163 FCR 1 at 33 [82] , I would not regard "myself under an executive injunction, not carried into the legislation, to give the words a wide interpretation". It may be, in that regard, that the author of the explanatory memorandum proceeded on an assumption as to its definitive effect which is not warranted. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] AATA 473">In Navy Health Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 931 ; (2007) 163 FCR 1 Jessup J said (at para.83): 
 
 Although a composite expression, I consider that the essence of "community service" is that a service is provided to the community, or a section of the community. Here the word "service" is used in the sense of "help, benefit or advantage", particularly "the action of serving, helping or benefiting, conduct tending to the welfare or advantage of another" (Oxford English Dictionary(2 nd ed))... 
 

His Honour said further (at para.84) that service :
 
 
 ...requires, in my view, the community, or a section of the community, to benefit by way of the receipt of some identifiable help, benefit or advantage bestowed or provided directly by the putative benefactor. Such a requirement, I consider, is not satisfied merely because, in this case, the operations of the applicant had a tendency to promote the efficiency of the armed forces, thereby benefiting the community as a whole.</sentence>
