<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 37">4 In addition to the unsuccessful claim for breach of contract, the appellant claimed that Qantas had contravened s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (TPA) and in respect of that statutory cause of action the appellant sought declarations. Whilst the appellant succeeded in establishing a contravention by Qantas of s 52 of the TPA, the primary judge in the exercise of his discretion refused to grant the appellant any relief: Leonie's Travel Pty Limited v International Air Transport Association (No 2) [2009] FCA 646. There is no appeal from the primary judge's refusal to grant relief under s 52 of the TPA. 107 For reasons that are not under attack and therefore do not need to be stated, the primary judge refused to make the declarations and injunction sought. He resolved costs in favour of Qantas: Leonie's Travel (No 2) [2009] FCA 646. In the end result, he ordered:
 1. The application as against the second respondent be dismissed. 
 
 2. The applicant pay eighty five per cent of the second respondent's costs of the application.</sentence>
