<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWADTAP 63">


17 Young J pointed out in Smith v University of Ballarat (2006) 229 ALR 343 ; 150 IR 371 ; [2006] FCA 148 ; BC200602407 that the formulation of the purpose in this way may not be apt in every case. Referring to the High Court's decision in Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199 ; 185 ALR 1 ; [2001] HCA 63 his Honour held that:

 
 
 [24] The purpose ordinarily served by an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo. The way in which Gleeson CJ put it in ABC was that the justice and convenience of imposing an interim restraint, pending the hearing of the final action, if it exists, lies in the need to prevent the practical destruction of the right that is sought to be vindicated by the proceedings before there has been an opportunity to have its existence finally established (at 217, [12]). This formulation may not be apt in every case, but it draws attention to the fact that there must be an appropriate connection between the form of interim relief that is sought, the danger or damage that is sought to be averted by the interim relief, and the final relief which is claimed in the action.  Although each of those matters is expressed in the alternative, the Tribunal does not have power 'at large' to make interlocutory orders to preserve any state of affair or every legal, equitable or statutory right a party to a complaint of discrimination may have. The power is limited by the language and purpose of s 105 to making orders affecting or relating to the statutory rights of the parties under the AD Act . The application must be for one of the purposes identified at [18] above and there must be 'an appropriate connection between the form of interim relief that is sought, the danger or damage that is sought to be averted by the interim relief, and the final relief which is claimed in the action': Smith v University of Ballarat (2006) 229 ALR 343 ; [2006] FCA 148 at [24] . If, as the Appellant submits, the Tribunal required both that the status quo be preserved and the rights of the parties be affected before making an interim order, it made an error of law in the way it construed s 105. However, as the Tribunal was addressing the question of whether it had power to make the order, rather than whether it should exercise its discretion to do so, the error was not of a kind referred to in Associated Provisional Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] NSWSC 1261">12 The principles on which an interlocutory injunction may be granted are, first, that there is a serious question to be tried and, secondly, that the balance of convenience favours the granting of the injunction: e.g. Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 86 ALJR 1672 at 1961 [65] per Gummow and Hayne JJ; Australian Coarse Grains Pool Pty Ltd v Barley Marketing Board (1982) 57 ALJR 425 at 426 (Gibbs CJ); Fejo v Northern Territory [1998] HCA 58 ; (1998) 195 CLR 96 at 141 [81] (Kirby J); Inetstore Corporation Pty Ltd (in liq) v Southern Matrix International Pty Ltd (2005) [2005] NSWSC 883 ; 221 ALR 179 at 184 [30] --- [31] (Campbell J); Hoppers Crossing Club Ltd v Tattersalls Gaming Pty Ltd [2005] VSC 114 at [18] (Kaye J); Mobileworld Operating Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2005] FCA 1365 (Weinberg J); and Smith v University of Ballarat [2006] FCA 148 ; (2006) 150 IR 371 (Young J). The " serious question to be tried " test originated in American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396 where at 407G it was said to mean that the applicant must show that the substantive claim is " not frivolous or vexatious ". In the High Court it has been said to mean the same thing as " a reasonably arguable case on both the facts and the law ": Australian Broadcasting Commission v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199 at 297. It is an undemanding standard. 16 The two guidelines approach and the three guidelines approach were noted in Smith v University of Ballarat [2006] FCA 148 ; (2006) 150 IR 371 by Young J who said (at 378):
[22] The general principles governing the grant of interlocutory injunctions are well settled. The Court must be satisfied that there is both a serious question to be tried in the principal proceeding, and that the balance of convenience favours the grant of an injunction... These two questions are not considered in isolation from each other; the strength or weakness of the claim will have a bearing on what is required by way of balance of convenience... 
...
[25] The Court will also consider whether damages are an adequate remedy. This can be undertaken separately from an examination of the balance of convenience: see, for example, Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148. But it can also be undertaken as part of the assessment of the balance of convenience, and this is, perhaps, the more common approach. </sentence>
