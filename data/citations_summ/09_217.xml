<citphrase id="cp29.7" type=cited from="[1981] FCA 41">administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 (cth), s. 44. the appellant was an alien who was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for drug offences. after his release the minister for immigration ordered that he be deported, and the appellant applied to the administrative appeals tribunal for review of the deportation order. the tribunal affirmed the decision of the minister, and the appellant appealed to the federal court against the decision of the tribunal.  section 44 of the administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 enables an appeal from the tribunal to the federal court only on a question of law. the appellant contended that the tribunal erred in law by placing too much weight on government policy and thereby abrogated its function of independently reviewing the minister's decision.  held: per deane j.</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp29.8" type=cited from="[1981] FCA 41">(1) the court's function on such an appeal is not to review the decisions of the minister, or the tribunal, upon their respective merits; but to determine on the material before it whether the decision involved an error of law.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 267">In SZMIP v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 217 , Flick J at [10] -[12] discussed the necessity to stipulate grounds of appeal as follows (at [10]-[12]): 
 
 
 Even if that difficulty be left to one side, the problem confronting the Appellants is only compounded by the fact that (as framed) the first two purported Grounds of Appeal do not comply with O 52 r 13(2)(b) of the Federal Court Rules , namely the requirement to state "briefly, but specifically, the grounds relied upon in support of the appeal". A statement that a Tribunal has "declined to exercise its jurisdiction" or has committed "jurisdictional error" does not satisfy that requirement. In attempting to provide a "useful practical guide", it has been said that a "notice of appeal which cannot be used to provide a sensible framework for the appellant's submissions" will "almost certainly" fail to comply with the requirements of O 52 r 13(2)(b): Commonwealth v Evans [2004] FCA 654 at [35] ; [2004] FCA 654 ; 81 ALD 402 at 411 per Branson J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1285">Although the first respondent did not take technical objection to ground 1, counsel submitted, correctly in my view, that it was flawed in substance (see SZMIP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 217 at [10] to [12]), as it did not identify the relevant considerations allegedly ignored by the Tribunal. Assuming, however, that as alleged before the Federal Magistrate, the relevant circumstances allegedly ignored were the appellant's inability to read or write Thai and his education at a British school, in my opinion, ground 1 is not made out.  Both grounds of appeal are therefore defectively framed for, as Flick J stated in SZMIP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 217 (at [9]): 
 
 
 The jurisdiction which is relevantly conferred on this Court is to entertain an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court. The first two purported Grounds of Appeal identify no error said to have been committed by that Court. No appellate jurisdiction is conferred on this Court to entertain any appeal from a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal.

 ... 
 
 

 
 
 
 [12] Neither of these two difficulties --- namely the failure to identify any error committed by the Federal Magistrate nor the failure to identify with acceptable precision the "ground of appeal" --- is considered to be a mere matter of form: SZJJC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 614 at [15] . Both are considered essential to this Court only exercising such jurisdiction as has been committed to it by the federal legislature.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1120">It is not sufficient for an appellant to state his grounds of appeal in the general terms in which the grounds of appeal in the present case have been specified. The grounds of appeal should identify with precision the errors made in the judgment under appeal and should indicate, in brief terms, the substance of the error allegedly made. In addition, the Notice of Appeal should state with precision the relief which is sought ( Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 157 ; (2002) 55 IPR 354 at [2] ---[5] (pp 355---356) (per Branson J) and at [48]---[54] (pp 368---370) (per Weinberg and Dowsett JJ); Argus Real Estate Holdings Pty Ltd v Lyristakis [2002] FCAFC 256 at [10] (per Spender and Miles JJ); Commonwealth v Evans ; [2004] FCA 654 ; (2004) 81 ALD 402 at [33] ---[35] (per Branson J); and SZMIP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 217 at [9] ---[13] (per Flick J)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 650">I accept the Minister's submission that the suggestion that jurisdictional error might arise due to the granting of visas to other people in the same situation, does not give rise to jurisdictional error (he cited Ibrahim v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 351 ; (2000) 60 ALD 465 at [19] - [21], Soboleva v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 528 ; (2001) 113 FCR 353 , Eloujenko v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2001] FCA 980 at [23] - [26] &amp; SZMIP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 217 at [26] - [32]). In any event, it is impossible to be satisfied that any other applicant in identical circumstances were granted refugee status in circumstances reflecting any error in the exercise by the present Tribunal member of her jurisdiction. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 106">Order 52 r 13(2) provides as follows: 
 
 The notice of appeal shall state: 
 (a) whether the whole or part only, and what part, of the judgment is appealed from; 
 (b) briefly, but specifically, the grounds relied upon in support of the appeal; and 
 (c) what judgment the appellant seeks in lieu of that appealed from. 
 

 
A notice of appeal which simply states (for example) that " the learned primary judge erred in fact and law " does not satisfy the requirement to state " the grounds relied on ": SQMB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 165 at [10] per Finn, Emmett and Bennett JJ. The notice of appeal there was properly characterised as " starkly uninformative ". Nor does a notice of appeal satisfy the requirement imposed by O 52 r 13(2)(b) where it simply states that " the Honorable Judge failed to follow necessary laws applicable to me ": NAXD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 243 at [3] per North, Dowsett and Conti JJ.
