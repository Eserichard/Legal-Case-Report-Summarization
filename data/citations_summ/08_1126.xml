<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] ATMO 62">Where an appropriate case exists and proper process is followed, directions of a more significant nature can be given under reg 5.16. The provision can thus be used to suspend an opposition - in other words, to defer (albeit only when appropriate and to a limited degree) the due date for evidence or for determination on the merits. The Registrar's experience is that, used in this way, a suspension can be an efficient alternative to repeated applications under reg 5.15 for extensions of time for serving evidence [2] . However, as Finkelstein J pointed out in Cadbury UK Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks [2008] FCA 1126 , (" Cadbury ") the Registrar has a statutory duty to decide oppositions, per s 55 of the Act and, more specifically per s 204 , "as soon as practicable". Therefore, the Registrar cannot suspend an opposition indefinitely but, in the performance of the duty referred to in Cadbury , there is (as here) considerable scope for debate about the appropriateness of suspension in any particular case.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] ATMO 21">Mr Merrick distinguished the finding of Finkelstein J in Cadbury UK Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks [2008] FCA 1126 (1 August 2008) that "the suspension of the opposition proceedings for an indefinite period amounted to a denial of justice and a refusal by the delegate to perform her duty to hear and determine those proceedings" (at paragraph 16). Counsel suggested that the suspension of opposition proceedings in order to await the outcome of separate Federal Court proceedings was a quite different situation than this case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] ATMO 87">In Cadbury UK Ltd. v Registrar of Trade Marks [2008] FCA 1126 the Federal Court heard an appeal from the Registrar's decision to suspend an opposition by Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd to a number of trade mark applications made by Cadbury UK Limited for shades of the colour purple in relation to chocolate and related products. Prior to that appeal, Cadbury had brought an action in the Federal Court against Darrell Lea for passing off. Because of that suit, the registrar had suspended the opposition proceedings. The question on appeal was whether the decision to suspend was lawful. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1308">The applicant submitted that where there is a pending Court proceeding of direct relevance to a matter before the Registrar, the Registrar prefers the Court proceeding to be concluded before determining the opposition. That may be so, but as Finkelstein J made clear in Cadbury UK Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks (2008) FCA 1126 the Registrar cannot refuse to deal with a matter on the basis that it is the subject of court proceedings. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] ATMO 92">Bickford agrees that the evidence before the court and the registrar is the same but does not agree that the Full Court's findings will be relevant to the opposition. In brief its reasons for this are: 
 &#10146; The relevant dates in the opposition proceedings are earlier than the relevant date in the court proceedings. As per Southern Cross [8] , the registrar must consider evidence in relation to the date of application. Here, the dates of application are 5 September 2005 and 2 February 2006. The likely date of any finding of passing off or breach of s 52 of the TPA, however, is April/May 2006, the time from which Bickford's product became available to consumers. &#10146; It would be erroneous for the registrar to rely on the court's findings of fact as on the reasoning of Finkelstein J in Cadbury [9] the delegate has to look at the evidence and make up his or her own mind.  I have considered the parties' arguments in terms of the relevant criteria set out in Cadbur y [11] .  The registrar has, from time to time, issued directions under reg 5.16 to suspend opposition proceedings. Recently, in Cadbury UK Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks [1] Finkelstein J at [12] affirmed the Registrar's power to suspend or temporarily stay proceedings for proper reasons. At [21] His Honour set out some factors which it may be appropriate to consider in deciding such a matter: 
Sometimes there will be circumstances in which it is appropriate to delay opposition proceedings and await a court's resolution of disputed facts that may be relevant in opposition proceedings. It is not possible to say with any precision what those circumstances might be. They would include (a) the degree of similarity of the issues involved (b) the significance of the issues to the opposition proceedings (c) whether the Registrar has more evidence that the trial judge (d) the likelihood of the judge's findings being challenged, and (e) whether it may be unfair (ie a breach of the rules of natural justice) to rely on the judge's findings or the evidence on which those findings were based. In particular cases other matters will be taken into account. Submissions
