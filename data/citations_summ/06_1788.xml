<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1508">43 I am entitled to have regard to that course of conduct. Indeed, s 4K(3) and (4) of the Crimes Act 1914 apply where a person has been charged with a number of offences against the same provision of a law of the Commonwealth. The Court is authorised to impose one penalty in respect of all of the offences, but that penalty is not to exceed the sum of the maximum penalties that could be imposed if a separate penalty were imposed in respect of each offence. In Bell v Queensland [2006] FCA 1788 ; (2006) 71 IPR 139 at 140-141 [6] - [9] Kiefel J considered it appropriate to impose one penalty in respect of a series of offences similar to Mr Vu's; see also Hamm v Middleton [1999] FCA 777 ; (1999) 44 IPR 656 at 659 [15] per von Doussa J.
