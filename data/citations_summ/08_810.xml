 [A]n unusual result if, in that circumstance, a franchisee's bargain was struck down in every case, regardless of the position in which it places the franchisee. It is not to be assumed in every case that a franchisee wishes to be relieved of their bargain. To render void every franchise agreement entered into where a franchisor had not complied with the Code would be to give the franchisor, the wrong-doer, an opportunity to avoid its obligations, and at the same time to place the franchisee in breach of obligations to third parties.

His Honour delivered reasons for judgment on 30 May 2008 ( Hoy Mobile Pty Limited v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 810 ; (2008) ATPR 42-240). Allphones appealed from that judgment. On appeal, Allphones was partly successful ( Allphones Retail Pty Ltd v Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 85). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCA 673">The effect obviously of the undertakings of the parties was that the applicant was not obliged to elect to renew the franchise agreement under the option created by cl 3 of the current agreement, pending the determination of the proceedings. At the time this proceeding was commenced, the parties were well aware of outstanding issues between the respondent and a number of franchisees including the applicant and these were referred to in the applicant's accompanying affidavit (and are currently pleaded out in the statement of claim). In particular, the parties were aware of the decision of the Court in Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 810. The formal orders of the Court made in consequence of this decision were made on 16 June 2008 and are to be found set out in Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 967. This decision and these orders (currently under appeal) were also relevant to franchise agreements between the respondent and a number of its other franchisees.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FCA 390">I have also indicated why I do not believe that is so but insofar as knowledge is concerned, it is not sufficient in my view for Fig Tree to say that Prime's witnesses should not be believed and a Jones v Dunkel inference should be drawn in relation to those whom it did not call. Even in relation to knowledge, the onus is on the party in default who relies on the pleaded affirmation. The innocent contracting party must be 'confronted' with two mutually exclusive courses of action between which it must in fairness to the delinquent party make a choice --- Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 810 at [224] - [225]. There cannot be a confrontation of that nature unless the innocent party has knowledge on which to elect. It has been said that the quality of that knowledge must be 'full knowledge' --- Sargent [1974] HCA 40 ; 131 CLR 634 at 642. Knowledge is required not only of the facts but of the circumstances surrounding the facts: Sargent at 642. It has also been said election is not to be lightly inferred. Rares J in Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 810 at [257] indicated that there must be 'full and frank disclosure' before a party can be put in a position where an election was necessary. While Prime does not advance a case that Fig Tree has not been frank in its disclosure, it has certainly pointed to significant matters of which Fig Tree was aware but which were not conveyed to Prime. They are matters of which Prime was not aware and matters of which Prime would need to be aware in order to have the necessary knowledge in order to elect.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FCA 17">35 At the end of his Honour's Reasons for Judgment, his Honour summarised the conclusions which he had reached (see Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 810 at [429] ---[431]). Allphones has appealed from his Honour's decision. That appeal has not yet been heard. It is neither necessary nor desirable for me to comment further on the subject matter of the Hoy Mobile proceedings. At the moment, it is sufficient if I note the date when his Honour delivered judgment (viz 30 May 2008) and the fact that his Honour said that Allphones had to account to its franchisees who were operating under the old franchise agreement for significant sums of money which it had received by way of commissions and rebates.  32 In 2006, Hoy Mobile Pty Limited ( Hoy Mobile ) commenced proceedings in this Court against Allphones. Those proceedings ( the Hoy Mobile proceedings ) were heard in February and March 2008 by Rares J. His Honour delivered Reasons for Judgment on 30 May 2008 ( Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 810). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] HCA 38">As Rares J pointed out in Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [74] , it would be an unusual result if, in that circumstance, a franchisee's bargain was struck down in every case, regardless of the position in which it places the franchisee. In the Federal Court, Rares J has declined to follow the reasoning of the Court of Appeal [18] . Its provisions were referred to by Rares J in Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 810 at [94] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FCA 967">10 Allphones argued that I should look at the number of paragraphs devoted to certain issues in my principal judgment, and take them as a guide to the amount of time occupied by those issues. They involved somewhat complex issues of fact and law. And there were overlaps, because some of the material dealing with affirmation also related to the issue of unconscionable conduct on the part of Allphones: Hoy Mobile (No 2) [2008] FCA 108 at [406] and [407]. Indeed, the affirmation argument also raised considerable overlaps with the claims for a store refresh payment by Allphones, Mr Ilivesky's demand on 30 June 2006 for Hoy Mobile to release a phone to Allphones for a retention customer, Allphones' letter of 3 July 2006 placing Hoy Mobile on commission hold and stock hold and its subsequent conduct in lifting those holds: see Hoy Mobile (No 2) [2008] FCA 810 at [222] . There were considerable periods of the hearing which focused on the question of fraud and Allphones' knowledge of it, both from its inception, and at the time of the alleged acts of affirmation which Hoy Mobile failed in substance to persuade me amounted to conduct supporting its claim. 1 The parties have agreed today on all of the orders which ought be made following delivery of my reasons in Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 810 , except the appropriate order as to costs.</sentence>
