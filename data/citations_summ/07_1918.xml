<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 104">The cases where a Tribunal is found to have fallen into jurisdictional error because it made its decision based upon factual findings not supported by evidence such as: SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 390 ; SFGB v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 231 ; QAAA of 2004 v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1918 ; NASA v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 653 are all cases where the finding was significant on its face and did not require considering distinctions in phraseology.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1690">" 
The applicant argues that the finding that the applicant demonstrated that he had little idea about what is involved in running a business [CB 94] which "leads the Tribunal to find that the applicant was not a biscuit shop proprietor" [CB 95] are not conclusions that the Tribunal could draw from evidence about what happened in a typical day in a biscuit shop. The respondent says that the applicant conceded he was unable to describe his job clearly in his response to the s.424A letter [CB 73] and this provided sufficient evidence for the Tribunal to come to the conclusions that it did. If a Tribunal makes a material finding of fact or draws an inference without probative evidence it will fall into jurisdictional error MIMIA v VOAO, VOAP [2005] FCAFC 50 per Wilcox, French and Finkelstein JJ at [5]; SFGB v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 231 per Mansfield, Selway and Bennett JJ at [19] and [30]; QAAA v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1918 per Collier J at [22]. In this case only the Tribunal had the benefit of listening to the tape of the delegate's interview. There is no obligation to do this; SZKOB v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1949 per Flick J at [12].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1740">24 In relation to the appellant's third ground of appeal, the appellant has not provided any particulars to explain this ground or as to why the Tribunal's decision was unreasonable. In any event, to the extent that the appellant claims unreasonableness in accordance with the principles articulated in Associated Provincial Picture Homes Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223 , I note that the Full Court has found that "unreasonableness" does not constitute jurisdictional defect (see Andary v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCAFC 211 and QAAA of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 1918). Accordingly, the appellant's third ground of appeal is not substantiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1433">In QAAA of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 1918 (" QAAA of 2004 ") the Tribunal accepted that the US was the "sworn enemy" of Iran, that it was likely that the applicant would be questioned upon return to Iran, but then found that the appellant would not be persecuted by Iranian authorities because the applicant held the lowly rank of "airman" in the US Navy. There was no evidence before the Tribunal regarding the reaction of the Iranian authorities to the appellant's navy service (at [26]). The Tribunal did have regard to a report that stated that there was " no evidence of any pattern of action by the regime today against Iranians simply because at one time they were middle-level or low ranking functionaries of the Shah's bureaucracy " (at [24]). Collier J held that this was the only obviously relevant evidence that the Tribunal had used to reach its conclusion. Her Honour concluded that the finding was not open on the evidence and was a jurisdictional error as outlined by the Full Court in Minister for Immigration v Epeabaka [1999] FCA 1. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 1239">The applicant submitted that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by making a finding of fact or drawing an inference without any probative evidence (see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VOAO &amp; VOAP [2005] FCAFC 50 at [5] , SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 at [19] and [30] and QAAA of 2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 1918 and authorities discussed at [22]). It was contended that the Tribunal had not merely failed to attribute weight to a particular item of information. Rather it had found that there was an inconsistency which did not exist. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 1119">However it was submitted that it could not be inferred from the statement accompanying the protection visa application that the applicant had relocated to Kathmandu for a reason other than what was put in his statement of 21 August 2006 to the Tribunal. There was said to be no evidence to support the finding that there was a difference between the two statements in relation to internal relocation to Kathmandu. The first statement simply noted as a matter of fact that the applicant's business had dropped off, while the other referred to Maoist extortion and a move to Kathmandu for security reasons. It was contended that there was nothing inconsistent between these two statements so that the Tribunal made a finding of fact or drew an inference without any probative evidence. This was said to amount to an error going to jurisdiction as there was no evidence at all to support such a finding (see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VOAO &amp; VOAP [2005] FCAFC 50 ; SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 and QAAA of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 1918 , per Collier J at [22] and cases discussed therein). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 407">By way of these submissions Mr Karp also sought to raise what he described as "an additional aspect of this topic". He referred to what he said was the common law position in England to the effect that if it is necessary that a particular fact exist before a decision can be made, the courts must enquire as to whether that fact exists ( Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council [1976] UKHL 6 ; [1977] AC 1014). He proposed that the position in Australia "may well be the same". He referred to Military Superannuation Board v Stanger [2002] FCA 671 ; [2002] FCA 671 ; (2002) 68 ALD 12 at [20] , per Kiefel J for the proposition that absence of evidence to support a decision is an error of law, and that this was consistent with the Full Federal Court in SFGB at [18]-[20], and QAAA of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2007) 98 ALD 695 ; [2007] FC A 1918 at [20] : "If there is no evidence in the case of a critical step in the Tribunal's ultimate conclusion then that constitutes a jurisdictional error. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 374">The applicants relied on the decision in QAAA of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Indigenous Affairs (2007) 98 ALD 695 , [2007] FCA 1918. However, in that case the Tribunal expressly stated that it made certain findings. Those findings were apparently made without evidence. The present case is different. The Tribunal rejected the relevant claim, which it was entitled to do, and had evidence to support its findings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FMCA 2091">In relation to (a) , Mr Turner submitted that there was no evidence to support such a finding. He referred the Court to QAAA of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 1918 (" QAAA "). </sentence>
