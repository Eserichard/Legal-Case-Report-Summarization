<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 321">In Kardas v Kalliakoudis [2008] FCA 1913 at [9] , Finkelstein J revisited his views in Gribbles v HIC and said this: 
 
 In [ Gribbles v HIC ] I suggested that 'in the absence of a hearing on the merits it is difficult to see how any order, other than an order that each party bear its own costs, can be made except in special circumstances'. In [ Champagne View v Shearwater ] Gillard J suggested that my requirement for 'special circumstances' was too strict. He went on to say that '[e]ach case must depend upon its own circumstances'. I agree with that approach. 
 

 The approach to be adopted when no hearing on the merits occurs
