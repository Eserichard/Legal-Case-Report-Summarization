<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1432">6 Meanwhile, on 11 November 2007 a third notice was issued. Mr Tervonen commenced proceedings challenging the third notice on 18 December 2007. The proceedings commenced by Mr Tervonen to challenge the third notice were the subject of judgments by Flick J on 30 April 2008 ( Tervonen v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCA 596) and 12 June 2008 ( Tervonen v Minister for Home Affairs (No 2) [2008] FCA 872). After the appeal against the judgment of Rares J was upheld on 6 March 2008 it was unnecessary for the Minister to rely upon the third notice and Flick J records that the Minister gave an assurance that no reliance would be placed on it. In response, Mr Tervonen's counsel accepted that there was no utility in further pursuing any challenge to it. He sought on Mr Tervonen's behalf, and Mr Tervonen was granted, leave to discontinue the proceedings commenced on 18 December 2007.</sentence>
