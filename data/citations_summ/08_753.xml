<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 240">In Asciak v Australian Secured and Managed Mortgages Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 753 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 298 at 304, Goldberg J said at [31]: 
 
 In order for paragraph (f) to apply, the proceeding which the plaintiff proposes to bring in the Family Court must be a proceeding to enforce the settlement agreement between Ms Asciak and himself or a proceeding in which the making of the settlement agreement is in issue. The plaintiff proposes to bring a proceeding to have the consent orders made by the Family Court on 30 August 2006 set aside. To the extent to which those consent orders are based on an agreement reached between the parties, the plaintiff is seeking to set aside that agreement; he is not seeking to enforce it or put in issue the making of it. Accordingly subparagraph (f) is of no assistance to the plaintiff. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 462">


7 Mr Wells of counsel, for the plaintiffs, submits that para (f) does not apply. He submits that it applies only where there is a question as to whether an agreement to settle the dispute was made. In support of that submission, he referred to the decision of Goldberg J in Asciak v Australian Secured and Managed Mortgages Pty Limited [2008] FCA 753 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 298. </sentence>
