<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 40">18 There was, according to the Tribunal, a difference between Bennett J's analysis in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v The University of Technology, Sydney [2006] FCA 964 ; (2006) 154 FCR 209 ( ABC ) and Greenwood J's approach in Australian Postal Corporation v Johnston [2007] FCA 386 ; (2007) 94 ALD 586 ( Australia Post ). The Tribunal considered that its preferred construction was consistent with Australia Post and not with ABC , although the differences in approach would not have led to different outcomes in the current case. In the event this latter conclusion was incorrect, the Tribunal went on at the end of its reasons to consider "the matter from both points of view".</sentence>
