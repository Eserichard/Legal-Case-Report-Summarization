<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 139">Where, after scrutinising a proposed settlement in a case involving civil contraventions of the law, the Court decides that it is appropriate to grant relief as suggested by the parties, or to substantially that effect, other aspects of the public interest in encouraging the settlement of litigation are served. First, future contraventions of a similar nature by other persons, once identified, may be readily acknowledged by them as a result of seeing the kind of consent orders made by the Court, including the content of declarations specifying the conduct complained of. Secondly, future contraveners will be able to understand that the Court has found similar conduct to be unlawful and has determined a form of appropriate relief. This can encourage early, or ultimate, co-operation with the regulator to agree on a resolution. And, a settlement that is acted on by the Court provides an indication of an appropriate outcome designed in the public interest to provide redress for the contraventions and educates members of the public, including other potential contraveners, about the necessity to conform with the requirements set by law. These principles derive from authorities such as NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 290G-291C per Burchett and Kiefel JJ; see too ACCC v Econovite [2003] FCA 964 at [11] per French; Australian Communications and Media Authority v Radio 2UE (No 2) [2009] FCA 754 ; (2009) 178 FCR 199 at 213-2151 [48] - [54] per myself. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1565">Eighthly , although the pecuniary penalty is a matter for the Court to determine ( Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72) , and the question of whether the Court ought to make declarations as to particular matters or injunctions framed in a particular way or at all necessarily involves discretionary considerations and questions of utility, the Court will attach significant weight to a negotiated settlement quickly reached between parties acting with the benefit of legal advice, provided the document identifies the conduct precisely; the responsibility of each respondent in that conduct is recognised (whether at the centre or at the margin); and the proposed penalty is within the range the Court would impose and is thus not manifestly inadequate: Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-375 ; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 ; Australian Communications and Media Authority v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 754 ; (2009) 178 FCR 199. The approach to the assessment of a pecuniary penalty under the Spam Act ought, in principle, to reflect some of the considerations applied by the Court in assessing a pecuniary penalty under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). In particular, the Court will have regard to the elements of specific and general deterrence and assess whether a proposed penalty might be so high as to be oppressive in all the circumstances: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) [2005] FCA 265 ; (2005) 215 ALR 301 ; TPC v Stihl Chainsaws (Aust) Pty Limited ; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v ACCC at 293. </sentence>
