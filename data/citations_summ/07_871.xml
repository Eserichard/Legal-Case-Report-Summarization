<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 902">The Minister referred then to the judgement in Davis v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) FCA 686 at [35] where Justice Dowsett decided that subregulation 3 (of Regulation 1.15A) "does not require that the Tribunal make specific findings concerning any of those matters. " The Minster referred then to the judgement in Chey v Minster for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) FCA 871 at [51] where Justice Kenny followed the decision of Justice Dowsett in Davis (supra) that "reg 1.15A(3) does not require the Tribunal to make specific findings concerning the matters to which it refers. " Justice Kenny decided at [51] that "whether the omission is indicative of jurisdictional error depends very largely on the circumstances of each case" . Justice Kenny decided at [52] that " The Tribunal made its finding " that it was not satisfied that the appellant and Miss Tong were residing together in Melbourne (and if they were it was not satisfied that the relationship was genuine). "" </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1380">He submitted that s.425 of the Act required the Tribunal to invite the applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments and he referred to a number of authorities which demonstrate that s.425 requires an " in substance opportunity to give evidence and present arguments " (see Chey v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 871 at [24] ). An evaluation of this argument required careful attention to the transcript of the proceedings before the Tribunal on 20 September 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1226">The whole purpose of the tribunal is to provide a review mechanism during which the applicant is given a hearing. Its role is significant as it is the final arbiter of fact over issues that could leave applicants returning to torture or their death. The decision making process by the tribunal must give real consideration to the case and materials put by the applicant: see generally the discussion by Kenny J in Chey v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 871. The tribunal must consider relevant and significant evidence before it: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VOAO &amp; VOAP [2005] FCAFC 50 and Bushell v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1193. </sentence>

It does not, however, necessarily follow from this that the Tribunal did not address this specific matter, although the omission may support such a conclusion. As Dowsett J said in Davis v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 686 at [35] , reg 1.15A(3) does not require the Tribunal to make specific findings concerning the matters to which it refers.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 776">Though the test in administrative proceedings, as in curial proceedings, is, in our view, one of objective possibility, the non-curial nature of the body or tribunal in question and the different character of the proceedings must, as already indicated, be taken into account. In the present case, a significant difference between curial proceedings and the proceedings of the [T]ribunal is that the former are adversarial and the parties are usually legally represented, whereas the latter are inquisitorial in nature and the parties are not represented. See also Chey v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 871 ; Rana v Australian Federal Police [2006] FCAFC 169 ; (2006) 44 AAR 151 at [49] - [50] ; Forge v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2006) 228 CLR 75 ; Jia Legeng 205 CLR 507 at 564-566 (per Hayne J); and Re JRL: Ex parte CJL [1986] HCA 39 ; (1986) 161 CLR 342. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1912">20 In assessing a claim of alleged bias, the High Court in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at 426-427 and 435 explained the test for apprehended bias in administrative proceedings in the following terms: 
 
 
 "The test for apprehended bias in relation to curial proceedings is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided. That formulation owes much to the fact that court proceedings are held in public. There is some incongruity in formulating a test in terms of "a fair-minded lay observer" when, as is the case with the Tribunal, proceedings are held in private. Perhaps it would be better, in the case of administrative proceedings held in private, to formulate the test for apprehended bias by reference to a hypothetical fair-minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias. Whether or not that be the appropriate formulation, there is, in our view, no reason to depart from the objective test of possibility, as distinct from probability, as to what will be done or what might have been done. To do otherwise, would be to risk confusion of apprehended bias with actual bias by requiring substantially the same proof. Though the test in administrative proceedings, as in curial proceedings, is, in our view, one of objective possibility, the non-curial nature of the body or tribunal in question and the different character of the proceedings must, as already indicated, be taken into account. In the present case, a significant difference between curial proceedings and the proceedings of the Tribunal is that the former are adversarial and the parties are usually legally represented, whereas the latter are inquisitorial in nature and the parties are not represented.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1954">16 Whether consideration is given to the grounds of appeal as set forth in the Notice of Appeal , the purported particulars there set forth, or to the further elaboration of the case in the Appellant's Outline of Submissions filed on 16 November 2007, it is considered that the challenge being made by the Appellant to the decision of the Tribunal is a challenge to the findings of fact made by that Tribunal. That is not the function or purpose of judicial review: see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 , 198 ALR 59 at 84 per Kirby J. Nor is jurisdictional error normally exposed by factual error: see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Cohen [2001] HCA 10 , 177 ALR 473. McHugh J there relevantly observed:
 
 [36] If an administrative tribunal applies a wrong legal test or asks itself or decides a wrong legal question, it may be a short step to concluding that it did not decide the question that it had to decide. But questions of fact are ordinarily for an administrative tribunal to determine and so are the reasoning processes employed to make such findings. Disagreement with a finding of fact or the reasoning process used to find it is usually a slender ground for concluding that a tribunal misconceived its duty.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FMCA 1057">53. The decision in SZBEL has been the subject of more recent consideration by Kenny J in Chey v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 871 (" Chey "). In that case her Honour referred at [25] to the decision of the High Court in SZBEL . She pointed out at [25] that in SZBEL : 
 
 
 "The review applicant was not on notice that two aspects of his account were in issue because the primary decision-maker had not based his decision on them, and the Tribunal did not identify them as important issues. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FMCA 1484">
 
 19. The applicant argued that the post hearing invitation under s.424A of the Act did not satisfy the Tribunal's obligations under s.425 of the Act because the right to an oral hearing was superior to a right to give written comments. The applicant also argued that the Tribunal's invitation during the hearing to add anything else did not satisfy the Tribunal's obligation to formulate the issues and give a hearing on them. The applicant relied in this context on the decision of Kenny J in Chey v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 871 at [34] where her Honour said: 
 
 
 Further, I accept that appellant's submission that this defect was not cured by the Tribunal's addressing a general invitation to Mr Chey at the conclusion of the hearing to add anything further that might occur to him. The timing and context made it clear enough that the Tribunal was not inviting Mr Chey, through his interpreter, to give any further evidence. Moreover, unless the Tribunal had identified what it saw as the issues arising, there was nothing that the appellant might usefully add, either at or after the hearing. </sentence>
