<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 823">Further, the Tribunal's invitation to the applicant to comment does not reveal error in the Tribunal sending that invitation following the Tribunal hearing ( SZGBT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 565 at [25] , Ex Parte Applicant M17/2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 86 at [61] - [65]). Conclusion
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 786">Further, I cannot see that simply by sending the section 424A letter that a hearing must be provided. In SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 , (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [55] to [63], [159] to [160], [164] and [185] (see also SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 ; [2007] HCA 26) the majority of the Court held that ss.424A(1) and 425 do not have a "sequential" operation. The Tribunal is permitted to send a letter pursuant to s.424A(1) without holding a further hearing in respect of the information which is referred to in that letter (see NBKM at [32] and SZGBT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 565 at [25] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 290">Mr Mitchell went on to submit that the authorities have clearly held that it is permissible for a Tribunal to send a letter under s.424A(1) after the hearing without holding a further hearing in respect to the information particularised in that letter [12] . Mr Mitchell submitted that the applicant's case was based on a factual assumption that the Tribunal formed a view prior to the hearing that the information particularised in the s.424A letter would form part of the reason for the decision. That assumption was without foundation and evidence and there is no basis in the Tribunal's reasons for an inference that the Tribunal formed such a view prior to the hearing. The very fact that the letter was sent after the hearing suggests that the Tribunal did not appreciate the significance of the information until after the hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 228">Contrary to what appears to be implicit in the reasoning in SZHLM sections 424A(1) and 425 do not have a sequential operation: SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [55] - [63] ; [159]-[164] and [185]; see also SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [13] . That is, just because an invitation to pursuant to s.424A(1) is sent to an applicant after a hearing has been held does not necessarily mean that a further hearing must follow. The authorities have clearly held that it is permissible for a Tribunal to send a letter pursuant to s.424A(1) after the hearing without holding a further hearing in respect to the information particularised in that invitation: see NBKM at [32]; SZGBT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 565 at [25] ; Win v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 56 at [24] - [28] ; Ex parte Applicant M17/2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 86 at [61] - [65]. No error necessarily arises when an invitation pursuant to s.424A(1) is sent after a Tribunal hearing. To the extent that the reasoning in SZHLM is inconsistent with SAAP and the authorities referred to above, that reasoning is erroneous and the Court should prefer the authority of SAAP and the other authorities that have applied SAAP.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 2012">In one sense it could be said that under SZBYR , the position as outlined in SAAP in relation to the temporal application of s.424A was clear. The obligation could be met both before and after the hearing. This has been applied in matters on appeal from this Court in the Federal Court. See, for example, SZGBT v Minister of Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 565 per Buchanan J at [6], [13] and [14]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 1941">The Court agrees with the written submission for the applicant at [21] that "the Court in SZBYR made it clear that it was not overruling SAAP...as to its temporal effect which was not limited to the pre-hearing stage ". The Court accepts the submissions for the first respondent that: The authorities have clearly held that it is permissible for a Tribunal to send a letter pursuant to s.424A(1) after the hearing without holding a further hearing in respect to the information particularised in that invitation: see SZGBT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 565 at [25] ; Win v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 56 at [24] --- [28]; Ex parte Applicant M17/2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 86 at [61] --- [65]. Accordingly, no error arises when an invitation pursuant to s.424A(1) is sent after a Tribunal hearing. In any case, the information referred to in the 424A letter did not, of itself, form part of the reason for decision as that information did not contain in its terms a rejection, denial or undermining of the Applicant's claims to be a person to whom Australia owed protection obligations: SZBYR at [17]. The reason for the decision was found in the Tribunal's appraisal of that information: CB 100. That appraisal was not itself information: SZBYR at [18]. </sentence>
