<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 970">The essential proposition which emerges from the competing contentions of Counsel for the applicants and MaxiTRANS and the authorities to which they have referred is that, in construing an industrial instrument, weight is to be given to the intentions of the parties making the agreement, and what the Court infers that those parties would have understood themselves to have agreed. That task is to be performed with an eye to the "nature and purpose of certified agreements" ( National Tertiary Education Industry Union v University of Wollongong [2002] FCA 31 , per Branson J at [28]), and with the general, rather than any particular individual, in mind: Ambulance Service Victoria (South Western Region) v Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union (1998) 80 IR 275 , per Northrop J at 280; see also Soliman v University of Technology, Sydney [2008] FCA 1512 ; (2008) 176 IR 183 , per Jagot J at [202]-[203]. Canons of construction applicable to a statute or a commercial agreement are not always, or completely, available in the interpretation of an industrial agreement. That is a reflection of the function of documents of that kind and the fact that they frequently embody the outcome of negotiations between lay persons unfamiliar or uncomfortable with legal drafting techniques or modes of expression. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 579">Counsel for the respondents also suggested that the WRA was a code in relation to instruments under the WRA and that there was no power under the WRA to grant declaratory relief in the strict sense in relation to rights and entitlements arising under an industrial instrument. In Soliman v University of Technology, Sydney [2008] FCA 1512 at [74] --- [81]) Jagot J made remarks to this effect in the context of considering what remedies were available for breach of an agreement. Her Honour did, as the applicant submitted, leave open the possibility that a consequential declaration could have been made. However that possibility related to the possibility of a declaration in relation to interpretation of an agreement under s.849 and in that context Jagot J found (at [111]) that in the circumstances of the case, " particularly the focus on the applicant's individual position" it was not appropriate to make any consequential declarations. Such remarks must be seen in light of her Honour's earlier acceptance, in considering general principles relating to the construction of industrial instruments, that in the task of construction "'consideration is had to the general, not to any particular individual whether an employer or employee (Ambulance Service Victoria (South Western Region) v Australian Liquor, Hospitality &amp; Miscellaneous Workers Union (1998) 80 IR 275 at 280)" . </sentence>
