<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1225">3 As I said in Rahman v Ashpole [2007] FCA 883 at [28] :
 
 'The jurisdiction of the Court to order costs is conferred by s 43 of the FC Act. The discretion is a general one. The Court takes special care when asked to make an order for indemnity costs against an unrepresented litigant but there is no bar to such an order (see Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223 at [55] --- [60] and Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 792 at [41] --- [46]).
