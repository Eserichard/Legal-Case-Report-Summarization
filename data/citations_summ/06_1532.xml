<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 559">7 Indeed, in his submissions before me, the applicant did not seek to demonstrate error in the court's reasons of 21 December 2006. He said that he had no disagreement with the judgment of the court, insofar as it was based (as necessarily it had to be) on the material then before the court. His point, rather, was that the respondent was somehow at fault for not having revealed to the court other material which might have made a difference, or for confining its arguments (on the application to strike out the Notice of Appeal) to purely technical or jurisdictional matters. The more the applicant developed the basis of his complaint in this regard, the more it became apparent that his objective was to use his appeal from the Tribunal as a vehicle to ventilate various factual matters which lay behind his original attempt to invoke the jurisdiction of the Tribunal (further details of which may be seen from an earlier judgment of mine in the same proceeding: Bittman v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2006] FCA 1532). Whatever issues the applicant may have with the respondent, the only question which was before the court on 21 December 2006 was whether the applicant's Notice of Appeal from the Tribunal's decision was competent. Of necessity, that was a technical question. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1786">1 The background to this matter is set out in the judgment of Jessup J in Bittmann v Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission [2006] FCA 1532 (' Bittmann v ASIC '). For clarity here, some elements of the procedural history are worth setting out again.</sentence>
