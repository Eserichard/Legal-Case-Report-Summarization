<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 500">I doubt that ignorance of the time limit would pass for a special reason. In SZJRV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 298 at [6] Flick J described this kind of an explanation as "not satisfactory". In the ordinary course of events a layperson would not be expected to be aware of the Court's time limits. Save perhaps for exceptional cases, ignorance of a time limit cannot therefore take the case out of the ordinary. </sentence>
