(b) there is, as required in accordance with subsequent authorities, a carve-out of the no-talk and no due diligence provision in relation to the director's fiduciary duties --- see clause 9.2(c) of the Framework Deed; and
 
(c) the exclusivity period has been adequately disclosed in the explanatory statement to go to the minority shareholders --- see pp 232 and 233 of the Explanatory Memorandum
 
  
 
 32 The authorities have held consistently that clauses of this kind are acceptable as long as the warranty is sufficiently disclosed in the explanatory statement to shareholders.

His Honour's assessment of the class-creation question was as follows (at [45]):
 

 
 
 "As the price to be paid by Broadcast Australia, if it exercises its call options over some 19% of the issued capital of Hostworks, is equivalent to the scheme consideration, and because if the scheme is not approved, those call options will lapse, in my view there is no sufficient reason to consider that the present holders of those shares should constitute a separate class for the purposes of the scheme meeting. The options do not affect the rights and obligations of those shareholders in relation to Hostworks. Those option grantors will not be advantaged or disadvantaged depending upon the outcome of the scheme in relation to other members of Hostworks. Broadcast Australia does not have the ability to exercise or to control the exercise of the votes attached to those shares in Hostworks before the exercise of the options, and effectively in practice before the meeting.

Details of this arrangement are also set out in section 11.7 of the scheme booklet. I am satisfied, at this stage, with the proposal whereby it is not proposed that Sentient constitute a separate class, relying on the two decisions which are identified in the written submissions at paragraph 45, namely Re Hostworks Group Ltd (2008) 26 ACLC 137 ; [2008] FCA 64 and Re Hills Motorway Ltd . </sentence>

The view consistently taken by courts in recent times is that a deemed warranty clause is unobjectionable as the purpose and effect of the deemed warranty clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. [2]  21 First, the exclusivity period is for a specified period of just less than 5 months. [8] Such a period is within the period of restriction that the courts have accepted as reasonable.

For the purposes of convening the meeting it is reasonable to assume that the option deed does not give rise to different interests. [19] 
 
  19 Santow J in Arthur Yates &amp; Co Limited [6] said that an exclusivity provision should be for no more than a reasonable period that is capable of precise ascertainment, must be subject to an overriding obligation not to breach director's fiduciary duties and should be given adequate prominence in the materials sent to members.

 A. Function of the Court 
 
 8 The function of the Court on an application to convene a meeting for a proposed scheme of arrangement [2] is well established by authority. The Court exercises a supervisory jurisdiction. Essentially the Court is concerned with whether the procedural and substantive requirements for the calling and conduct of a meeting will be met. The particular provisions are: 
 
 (i) A deemed warranty provision 
 
 12 The proposed scheme provides for a deemed warranty from the Healthscope shareholders that their shares are free from encumbrances. The view consistently taken by Courts in recent times is that a deemed warranty clause is unobjectionable as the purpose and effect of a deemed warranty clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. [8] In the circumstances, and consistently with the preponderance of authority, I do not regard the warranty clause as posing any issue in relation to the Court exercising its power to convene the meeting. 13 I am also satisfied that there is adequate disclosure of this provision in the explanatory booklet. [9] 
(ii) Exclusivity Provisions 
14 Healthscope has agreed to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit or accept alternative proposals for a certain period.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 853">The courts have concerns regarding the impact of clauses of this nature upon the fiduciary duties of directors in dealing with alternative bidding proposals. However, the terms of this scheme implementation agreement incorporate, what is sometimes referred to as, the fiduciary obligations carve out ( Re Hostworks Group Ltd [2008] FCA 64 at [33] - [34]). I am satisfied that the presence of the "no talk, no shop" provisions would not preclude the Court from approving the scheme of arrangement, if the requisite majorities are obtained. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FCA 7">An 'arrangement' under a scheme is a broad notion.

(b) there is a carve out in relation to directors' fiduciary duties contained in cl.10.2 of the Implementation Agreement; and

In Re Hostworks Group Ltd [2008] FCA 64 ; (2008) 26 ACLC 137 , the Implementation Agreement was entered into on 7 December 2007, an order for convening of a meeting of members was made on 21 December 2007, and the sunset date was 31 May 2008. There was, therefore, an overall period of nearly six months, of which a period of five months was to run from the date of the first court hearing to the sunset date. Mansfield J did not regard these periods as unreasonably long (at [33]-[37]). </sentence>

11 The fourth issue was the deemed warranty in cl 4.5 of the Share Scheme that the shares be free from encumbrances. Mr Jackman referred me to the view which is accepted in this Court as stated in Re Hostworks Group Ltd [2008] FCA 64 ; (2008) 26 ACLC 137 at [41] . This view has been followed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales by Barrett J in Macquarie Private Capital A Ltd [2008] NSWSC 323 ; (2008) 26 ACLC 366. The clause was therefore in accordance with established authority and it was drawn to the attention of scheme participants: see further Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd at [63].

 Deemed warranty 
 
(10) Clause 8.6 of the Share Scheme states that:
 
Each Scheme Participant is deemed to have warranted to [Incitec US Holdings] that all of their Scheme Shares (including any rights and entitlements attaching to those shares) will, at the date of the transfer of them to [Incitec US Holdings], be fully paid and free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise, and restrictions on transfer of any kind, and that they have full power and capacity to sell and to transfer their Scheme Shares together with any rights and entitlements attaching to such shares. (11) This type of clause was strongly criticised by Fryberg J in Mincom No 1 [13] as being:
 
onerous, unreasonable and calculated to catapult unsuspecting shareholders who have not read the small print of the arrangement in the schedule to the explanatory statement into a statement of breach of warranty. (12) However, the subsequent line of authorities, including APN, Adelaide Bank, [14] Re Orion Telecommunications Ltd [15] , Coles Group No 1 [16] and Re Hostworks Group Ltd, [17] consider such clauses to be acceptable as long as the warranty is sufficiently disclosed in the explanatory statement to shareholders. (13) Having regard to the disclosure made in section 1.11 of the draft Scheme Booklet, we submit that this deemed warranty clause is acceptable. Performance Risk 
 
(14) Some recent court cases have raised the issue of 'performance risk' --- ie, the danger that the bidding company may be, or may become, unwilling or unable to meet its obligations to pay the cash consideration component to the transferor shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] NSWSC 323">13 The third matter concerns the inclusion in the schemes of arrangement of a warranty to which each security holder will become bound that the holder's securities are not encumbered. The provision is in terms corresponding with those considered by Mansfield J in Re Hostworks Group Limited [2008] FCA 64. I quote paragraph [41] of his Honour's judgment: 
 

 
 
 "Under cl 7.3(a) of the Implementation Agreement, each scheme participant is deemed to have warranted that all of its shares in Hostworks which are transferred under the scheme will be free from all mortgages and encumbrances. Fryberg J in Re Mincom Ltd (No 3) (2007) 25 ACLC 207 , regarded an almost identical deemed warranty clause as onerous and unreasonable and "calculated to catapult unsuspecting shareholders who have not read the small print of the arrangement in the schedule to the explanatory statement into a state of breach of warranty": at [21].</sentence>
