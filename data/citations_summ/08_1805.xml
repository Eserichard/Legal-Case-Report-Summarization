<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 450">For similar observations, see Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1805 at [23] - [24]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 323">M2006 claims that it is entitled to indemnity costs from the date upon which it made an offer of compromise. That offer was made on 12 June 2008 and was rejected. Both parties accept that in claiming indemnity costs a party must show that the rejection of the offer of compromise was "imprudent or unreasonable": Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1805 at [23] and the cases cited therein. As Kenny J said in that decision at [24]: 
 
 The question is, therefore, whether or not it can be said that the applicants acted imprudently or unreasonably in rejecting Redberry's offer of compromise in relation to the applicants' claim. Plainly enough, even in the present circumstances, the mere refusal of an offer of compromise is not sufficient to satisfy this test: see John S Hayes &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 201 at 206 per Hill J and Dukemaster [2003] FCAFC 1 at [7] . Although the refusal of the offer is a factor to take into account, it is not determinative on the question of indemnity costs. As Sackville J said in Seven Network [2007] FCA [2007] FCA 1489 ; 1489 ; 244 ALR 374 at [65] , "the court is required to consider whether the rejection of the offer of compromise was unreasonable by considering, among any other relevant circumstances, the strengths and weaknesses of the applicants' case, looking at the claim prospectively at the time the offer was made" (emphasis original). 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 1018">It is submitted that this provision commenced operation on 2 August 2008 and does not apply to an Offer of Compromise made before that date: Review 2 Pty Ltd (in liq) v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd (No.2) [2008] FCA 1805 at [20] . As the Offer of Compromise relied upon by the Respondents in this matter was made after 2 August 2008 the provision applies to these proceedings. The purpose of the provision has been expressed as followed in Granitgard Pty Ltd v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd (No.6) [2010] FCA 381 at [41] [41] Order 23 r 11(6) forms part of a regime the aim of which is to encourage compromise with the attendant benefits for the parties in terms of agreed certainty of outcome, as opposed to the risks of litigation and for the nation in terms of allowing limited judicial resources to be deployed in the resolution of the truly intractable controversies. It does this by encouraging a Respondent to make a realistic offer of compromise and encouraging an Applicant who receives such an offer to accept it lest, if the Respondent obtains a more favourable judgement, the Applicant become liable to a greater amount of costs as a result of the Respondent having a prima facie entitlement to taxation on an indemnity basis. One way of viewing cases which have termed an offer "not genuine" is to regard them as examples of cases where the offer could be seen not to advance the underlying purpose of an order such as O 23. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 920">Therefore, SBriggs could not have been conscious of any presumptive entitlement that might arise in Uniline as an offeror respondent to SBriggs's cross-claim upon rejection of the offer. The rule simply cannot apply to the offer: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2008] FCA 1805. Accordingly, in considering for the purposes of s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act , the appropriate order to be made in the disposition of costs, no presumptive entitlement to indemnity costs arises in respect of Uniline's costs incurred in answering the cross-claim for infringement. However, the offer to compromise ought to be taken into account because it provided SBriggs with an opportunity to foreclose the litigation without any obligation to pay any costs to Uniline.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 803">Surprisingly, there is uncertainty about the effect of the rule on the court's discretion to award costs. There are two lines of authority. First, there is the literal view of O 23 r 11(6) which is that if the rule is attracted, it "creates a presumptive entitlement in the respondent to indemnity costs after 11 am on the day after the offer was made": Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1805 at [20] . In that event the court's discretion to allow a party to escape from the obligation to pay indemnity costs "will, in general, be exercised only in an exceptional case --- Leichhardt Municipal Council v Green [2004] NSWCA 341 and it is for the plaintiff to prove that the court should 'order otherwise' --- Gretton v The Commonwealth of Australia [2007] NSWSC 149 at [9] ": Pollard v Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineering Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 486 at [6] cited with approval in Equity 8 Pty Limited v Shaw Stockbroking Limited [2007] NSWSC 503 at [33] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 571">Flottweg approached its application for costs on the basis that the presumption for which O 23 r 11(6) provides was not applicable to any of the offers which it had made, given that each was made and had lapsed prior to 2 August 2008. That approach is supported by authority: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1805 at [20] per Kenny J, referring to s 59(4) of the Federal Court of Australia Act , and s 12(2)(b) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 (Cth) (Legislative Instruments Act ). Olivaylle's position was no different.  In Australian and International Pilots Association v QANTAS Airways Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 879 ; (2007) 162 FCR 392 at 396 Tracey J remarked: 
 statutory provisions dealing with the power to award costs are procedural in nature and, in the absence of contrary legislative intention, will operate retrospectively at least to the extent of applying to cases commenced before the amendment: see eg Galvin v Forests Commission (Vic) [1939] VicLawRp 42 ; [1939] VLR 284 at 297-8; Jackman v Dandenong Sewerage Authority (No 2) (1967) 20 LGRA 413 at 415. 

Here, a contrary legislative intention is evident in relation to any operation O 23 r 11(6) might otherwise have with respect to past events. Like Kenny J in Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1805 , I consider that such a conclusion is dictated by s 12(2)(b) of the Legislative Instruments Act . I also consider that s 12(2)(a) of the Legislative Instruments Act provides additional support for that view in that, prior to the making of the amendment to the rules, there existed a right to the exercise of a discretion with respect to the awarding of costs unfettered by any such prima facie presumption. </sentence>
