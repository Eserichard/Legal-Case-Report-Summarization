<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 136">4 The first respondent submitted that the agreement for arbitration must itself be in writing and that a strict view should be taken of that requirement. Reliance was placed in that regard upon the primary judge's decision in Pan Australian Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship Comandate (No 2) [2006] FCA 1112. That part of the primary decision was however held to be erroneous by the Full Court. It was explained by Allsop J (in the appeal decision at [148]-[151]) that Article II requires bilateral recognition of an arbitration agreement. Relevantly to this matter the Court held that it does not require that the contract be formed by an exchange of letters. Conduct might suffice. What is required is that the terms of the agreement and assent to those terms are in exchanged documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCAFC 192">19 The matter came before the primary judge again on 13 and 14 July 2006. The questions before his Honour were whether the anti-anti-suit injunction should be extended and whether a stay of the proceedings of this Court should be given under the International Arbitration Act , or otherwise . On 13 July 2006, after taking evidence and hearing argument over two days, his Honour reserved his decision on the stay application and extended the anti-anti-suit injunction until further order. On 22 August 2006, the primary judge made an order dismissing the motion for a stay of the proceedings of the Court and left undisturbed the anti-anti-suit injunction: see Pan Australian Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship 'Comandate' (No 2) [2006] FCA 1112. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1446">55 In Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship 'Comandate' (No 2) [2006] FCA 1112 at [102] - [113] I examined the authorities on the meaning of the expressions 'arising out of' and 'arising from' in arbitration clauses in the context of whether disputes arose out of or from the relevant contract. As Lord Sumner observed in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Coke Co Ltd [1916] 1 AC 314 at 328 the words are less precise than they look. He said that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract. But, he said that the jurisdiction which the submission to arbitration confers is wide.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] NSWSC 1150">In James Allen (Ireland) Ltd v Marea Producten B.V. (Netherlands) ( Yearbook X (1985) p 485) the Court of Appeal in the Hague held that there was no enforceable arbitration agreement, despite the regular prior use (in at least 25 successive transactions) of particular general conditions of trade (which included an arbitration clause) because in the particular case the general terms had not been referred to [Referred to in Landau, "Requirement of Written Form", p 42]. ix. The issue of the meaning of the " agreement in writing " requirement in the context of the International Arbitration Act has recently been the subject of a close and careful analysis by Rares J. in Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship 'Comandate' (No 2) [2006] FCA 1112 at [70] - [87]. What emerges from that decision is that:

a) there will only be an arbitration agreement between the parties within the meaning of the International Arbitration Act if it is:

1. contained in a document signed by both parties; or

2. contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document;

b) confirmation in writing by one of the parties which is kept without contestation by the party will not suffice, and

c) an agreement in writing within the meaning of the Act could not be established by a course of dealing. x. 40 As HIH has contended:

i. an arbitration agreement may become inoperative or incapable of being performed as a result of the operation of common law doctrine (see, for example, election: La Donna Pty Limited v Wolford AG [2005] VSC 359 ; (2005) 194 FLR 26 ; Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship 'Comandate' (No 2) [2006] FCA 1112 ;
 
ii. this being so (and well-established), there is no reason as a matter of logic, policy or the language of the Act why an arbitration agreement could not become inoperative by operation of statute, whether Commonwealth or State;

iii. the trilogy of concepts employed in the sub-section --- null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed --- emphasises the breadth of its intended operation. iv. this trilogy of concepts derives from Article II (3) of the New York Convention which is an international convention; its signatories extend far beyond the family of common law countries; 

v. when this is appreciated, it simply cannot have been intended that the meaning of these terms (including "inoperative") can have been intended to be confined to the consequences of the operation of common law principles;
 
vii. such a construction would fly in the face of the accepted approach to the construction of terms in or deriving from an international convention. As Rares J recently noted in Pan Australia Shipping Ltd v Comandate Marine Corp [2006] FCA 1112 at [80] :

 It has been recognized that a national court, in the interest of uniformity, should construe rules formulated by an international convention , especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods, in a normal manner, appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention , unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law, or by English or domestic legal precedent, but on broad principles of general acceptation : Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd [1980] HCA 51 ; (1980) 147 CLR 142 at 159 per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce's speech in James Buchanan &amp; Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping (UK) Ltd [1978] AC 141 at 152 and see too: Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M/V Sky Reefer [1995] USSC 75 ; 515 US 528 at 537 (1995) per Kennedy J (Renquist CJ, Scalia, Souter, Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing). [emphasis added]

viii. the law of contract in New South Wales is far more than simply common law principles; it extends to and includes all applicable State and Federal statutes such as the Contracts Review Act , the Industrial Relations Commission Act , the Fair Trading Act and, in the present context, the Insurance Act . 40 As HIH has contended:

i. an arbitration agreement may become inoperative or incapable of being performed as a result of the operation of common law doctrine (see, for example, election: La Donna Pty Limited v Wolford AG [2005] VSC 359 ; (2005) 194 FLR 26 ; Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship 'Comandate' (No 2) [2006] FCA 1112 ;

viii. the law of contract in New South Wales is far more than simply common law principles; it extends to and includes all applicable State and Federal statutes such as the Contracts Review Act , the Industrial Relations Commission Act , the Fair Trading Act and, in the present context, the Insurance Act . The drafters of the Convention considered and rejected a proposal by the Dutch delegate to add to the definition of Article II(2) a third category, whereby an arbitration agreement "in writing" could be proved by demonstrating that there had been "confirmation in writing by one of the parties [which is kept] without contestation by the other party" [Van den Berg, New York Convention , pp 179 and 196, citing UN DOC E/CONF.26/L.54 and SR.22]. The rejection of this proposal is referred to by Rares J. in Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship 'Comandate' (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1112 at [78] - [79]. iv. In Kahn Lucas Lancaster Inc v Lark International Ltd (1999) 14 Mealey's International Reports C1 (29 July 1999); [1999] USCA2 329 ; (1999) 186 F 3d 210 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held (at [C5-C6]) that the modifying phrase "signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams" applies to both arbitral clauses in contracts and arbitration agreements.</sentence>
