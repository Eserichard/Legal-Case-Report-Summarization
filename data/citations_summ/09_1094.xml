<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 969">The Court's jurisdiction does not extend to a review of the Tribunal's decision on the merits, but is limited to the resolution of the controversy between the parties on questions of law: Webb v Teeling [2009] FCA 1094 at [4] ; Flexiplan Australia Ltd v Pankhurst [2001] FCA 1535 (" Flexiplan ") at [5]; TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v FCT [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178-182.

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] SCTA 23">In a recent decision of the Federal Court in Webb v Teeling [2009] FCA 1094 (29 September 2009), there was an issue as to whether the Trustee's decision to pay part of a death benefit to the deceased member's mother, who then died before the trustee's final decision, should be set aside. It was decided both by this Tribunal and by the Federal Court, on appeal, that the mother was no longer a financial dependant at the time of the Trustee's final decision because of her earlier death. The trustee's decision was, therefore, set aside.
