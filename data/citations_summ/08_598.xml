 Whilst I am in general agreement with the above summary, the question of whether a consent award/order can give rise to an issue estoppel (point (vi) above) has been considered in several relevant authorities. Those authorities suggest that, in certain circumstances, issue estoppels can arise from consent awards/orders, though the nature and extent of such an estoppel will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and has not been finally determined ( The Doctrine of Res Judicata by Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley (' Spencer Bower '), third edition, 1996, at [38]). There is no issue estoppel in a changing situation ( Spencer Bower , at p102 and Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v The National Competition Council [2008] FCA 598 at [114] to [116]), and a later claim for hearing loss compensation as a result of a further injury is one example of such a situation. This point is succinctly illustrated in Spencer Bower (at [185]):
 
"An agreement to pay compensation registered under the Workmen's Compensation Acts estopped the employer from disputing liability for the accident; but not from contending that the worker's death did not result from it. "
 
 The authorities cited in Spencer Bower are Cleverley v Gas Light and Coke Co (1907) 24 TLR 93 and O'Donel v Commissioner for Road Transport [1938] HCA 15 ; (1938) 59 CLR 744 (' O'Donel ').</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 1363">A final judgment (such as the decision of Riethmuller FM dismissing the earlier creditor's petition) may affect subsequent proceedings between the same parties in a number of ways, as summarised by Weinberg J in Hamersley Iron Pty Limited v The National Competition Council [2008] FCA 598. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] NSWWCCPD 100">However, the extent to which a consent order may give rise to issue estoppels has not been finally determined ( Spencer Bower , at [38]). There is no issue estoppel in situations capable of change ( Spencer Bower , at p102 and Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v The National Competition Council [2008] FCA 598) , and a later claim for lump sum compensation is one example of such a situation. This point is succinctly illustrated in Spencer Bower (at [185]):
 
"An agreement to pay compensation registered under the Workmen's Compensation Acts estopped the employer from disputing liability for the accident; but not from contending that the worker's death did not result from it. "
