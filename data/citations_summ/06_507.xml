<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 286">15 One question that was not expressly dealt with in the cases referred to above is whether a dismissal on the basis of a lack of jurisdiction is a final or an interlocutory order. The Full Court of this Court has held that such an order is an interlocutory order: '....at least where the order does not necessarily finally dispose of the rights of the parties. ': see Applicant NAGM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 395 at [6] (' NAGM ') and Mentyn v Westpac Banking Corporation [2004] FCAFC 149 at [3] . See also SZECK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 283 per Merkell J at [31] to [37] cf [38]. However, there has been a number of decisions of judges of this court that have held that a dismissal for want of jurisdiction is a final order: see MZXIW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 123 at [3] , NADZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 975 at [29] , MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 507 at [18] and MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 466 at [6] . In my view there is no conflict between these two sets of decisions because the latter all appeared to me to rely upon the High Court's decision in Anshun as explained by the Full Court in Egglishaw and therefore concluded that the order at issue finally disposed of the rights of the parties within the qualification expressed by the Full Court in NAGM (see above).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1075">11 Even if leave were sought, I would not be disposed to grant it. The present is a hopeless case. This is the second occasion in which the appellant has instituted proceedings for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in March 2004. There is no suggestion that the appellant seeks to challenge the decision on any new ground. Res judicata can operate as a bar to a judicial review application in these circumstances: see, for example, MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 466 at [11] referring to Wong v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 204 ALR 722 at [71]; and MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 507 at [15] . Even if the circumstances did not give rise to res judicata, these second judicial review proceedings would attract an Anshun estoppel: see Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589. Such an estoppel bars a party from raising any point which properly belonged to the subject of earlier litigation that the party, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time of the earlier proceeding. Furthermore, there is nothing to support the appellant's contention that the course taken by the Federal Magistrate on this occasion was so unfair or otherwise affected by error that it ought be set aside on appeal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 178">6 There are a number of decision of the Court which, in different circumstances, treat summary dismissal as an interlocutory judgment or as a final judgment: cf SYWB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 402 ; MZWHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 491 with NADZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 975 ; MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 507 ; MZXIW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 123 ; MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 466. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 123">3 In NAGM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 395 , Sackville, Allsop and Jacobson JJ said at [6] that "an order dismissing an application for want of jurisdiction is interlocutory in character, at least where the order does not necessarily finally dispose of the rights of the parties. " However in two recent cases, single judges of this Court have specifically considered the nature of summary dismissal under r 13.10 and concluded that it is final in nature: NADZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 975 at [29] per Graham J; MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 507 at [18] per Kenny J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FMCA 1481">Hence, in my view, it is preferable to consider the application for summary dismissal under r.13.10, which arguably may be regarded as a final decision (see MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 507 at [18] ).</sentence>
