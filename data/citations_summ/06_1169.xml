<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 553">The facts of the present case are similar to but not as strong as the facts in Norman v O'Mahony [2006] FCA 1169. In Norman v O'Mahony [2006] FCA 1169 , the party who had failed to claim privilege was found to have been well aware of her entitlement to do so at the time the search warrant was executed. The police officer who executed the warrant told her that she could claim legal professional privilege over documents, if that was appropriate. On the facts of that case, Cowdroy J considered that she should have made the claim either at the time the search warrant was executed or immediately thereafter. No claim was made for some time. In those circumstances, his Honour held that the applicant had waived the privilege.  The facts of the present case are similar to but not as strong as the facts in Norman v O'Mahony [2006] FCA 1169.
