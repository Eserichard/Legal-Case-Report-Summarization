<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 120">My conclusions about the rating of Mr Hands' impairment must take into account his description of his symptoms and their effects on his life, as informed by the medical evidence. The Guide is an imprecise and somewhat difficult tool to apply in assessing pain, and in particular chronic pain. I was mindful in rating Mr Hands' impairment that conclusions are relevantly to be drawn from the history given by the applicant and people who can speak about matters going to impairment, not simply the evidence of medical practitioners. [19] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 825">In the evidence that he has given and in the accounts given to medical practitioners Mr Bryant has been quite consistent in describing the frequency of his headaches. He is affected virtually daily but frequently (and certainly 12 or more times per year) the intensity will increase markedly. These more severe occasions are rated by Mr Bryant variously as 2 to 3 on a scale of 1 to 5 [6] or 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. [7]  That decision was affirmed on reconsideration on 24 July 2006 and thereafter proceedings were commenced in this Tribunal. [1] 
  Next, the proper approach to the task means that there is no requirement that all, or most, or any particular one, of the activities of daily living have been interfered with. [4] And interference with activities of daily living will be minor "if it is small in size, extent or importance". [5] </sentence>
