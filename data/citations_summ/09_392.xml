<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 375">The first respondent then relied on a number of authorities in which the Court or the Federal Magistrates Court made orders requiring the Tribunal to hear and determine a review application even though the notification of the decision did not comply with the regulation: Pomare v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 458 ; (2008) 167 FCR 494 ; Zhan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 327 ; (2003) 128 FCR 469 ; Patel v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 392 ; (2009) 108 ALD 151 ; MZXGL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2006) FMCA 1724 ; MZXGM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2006) FMCA 1723 ; 204 FLR 480 ; SZKHR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) FMCA 138. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1112">However, if the Tribunal refuses the application for waiver of the fee, the Tribunal must given the Applicant a reasonable period of time to pay the application fee in light of the Applicant's particular circumstances. [17] Considerations
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1105">I am referred to the decision of Braganza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [12] , which is a decision of Wilcox, Weinberg and Stone JJ. Their Honours held: Where an applicant for a visa makes an application for a waiver of the prescribed fee in accordance with regulation 4.13 , and that application is made within the prescribed period, the application for review may be entertained, provided that the fee is either eventually waived, or paid within a reasonable time after the application for waiver is rejected. That is, subsection 347(1)(c) should be read as being subject to the qualification that, provided an application for a waiver of the fee has been made within the prescribed period, the MRT is not prevented from considering the application for review merely because the prescribed fee has not been paid within the prescribed time [13] . However, if the Tribunal refuses the application for waiver of the fee, the Tribunal must give the applicant a reasonable period of time to pay the application fee in light of the applicant's particular circumstances (see, in particular, Patel v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [14] . ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 967">However, if the Tribunal refuses the application for waiver of the fee the Tribunal must give the Applicant a reasonable period of time to pay the application fee, in light of the Applicant's particular circumstances. (See in particular Patel v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [24] . ) In that case, which was an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court, Gray J held, at [15]: For the purposes of the application of the principle enunciated in Braganza, however, the Tribunal was required to consider whether a reasonable time after that date had been allowed for the payment of the prescribed fee. A reasonable time can never be a period determined arbitrarily. The reasonableness of the time allowed must be determined, in each case, according to the circumstances of that case. If, in a particular case, the person to whom the letter is addressed has not received it in fact, that is one of the circumstances that must be taken into account in determining whether a reasonable time has in fact elapsed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 590">His Honour was unable to find any authority on the point. It could be argued that where there are circumstances which allow the Tribunal a choice between affirming the delegate's decision or remitting the matter so as to give the applicant an opportunity to satisfy the criteria for the visa, the Tribunal would at least be required to consider the latter option. In Patel v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 392 the Tribunal discovered information which may have justified giving the applicant an extension of time to apply for review. In declining to consider the factual question, the Court found that the Tribunal had wrongly declined to exercise its jurisdiction. By analogy, in the instant case, had the Tribunal known of the Department's policy, it would have been required to at least consider whether it was appropriate for it to exercise its power to remit.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 383">It is unnecessary to decide whether the Tribunal also erred in failing to direct its mind to its discretion to remit, or to delay a decision. The error arose because the Tribunal failed to make an enquiry that would have properly informed its exercise of discretion, had the Tribunal directed its mind to it. It is safe to assume, however, that where the discretion exists, it must be exercised judicially: see for example Patel v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 392. </sentence>
