<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1941">How then does one assess the overall impression of a design in infringement proceedings? As noted earlier, until recently there has been little Australian judicial consideration of the 2003 Designs Act. The principal cases to date include Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74 ; (2008) 166 FCR 358 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 and World of Technologies (Aust) Pty Ltd v Tempo (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 114 ; (2007) 71 IPR 307. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] NSWSC 645">332 The High Court approved this reasoning without further discussion in Zhu v Treasurer of NSW [2004] HCA 56 ; (2004) 218 CLR 530 (at 586 [157]) where it stated that " to continue to deal with TOC would have been tortious after the plaintiff obtained notice of the Licence Agreement " and cited DC Thomson &amp; Co Ltd v Deakin . The above passage from DC Thomson &amp; Co Ltd v Deakin also was approved by Lindgren J in Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (at 44), although his Honour was there dealing with a case of procurement or inducement of breach. Jessup J in World Technologies (Aust) Pty Ltd v Tempo (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 114 treated this statement by Lindgren J as correct (at [107]). Jessup J considered the authorities relied upon by Jenkins LJ, and although his Honour expressed reservations about the strength of support to be gained from two of those authorities, thought that De Francesco v Barnum (1890) 63 LT 514 provided support for the proposition. It is clear that the tort extends to participation in the breach once the third party knows that the relevant act is inconsistent with the contract.</sentence>
