<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 490">1 Before me is an application under the Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) ( the Act ) for confirmation of a scheme involving the transfer of the insurance business of the first applicant, MDU Australia Insurance Company Pty Limited ( MDU ), to the second applicant Avant Insurance Limited ( Avant ). Some of the background to the proposal was outlined in my reasons, of 14 February 2008, for dispensing with the need for compliance with the provisions of s 17C(2)(c) of the Act (see MDU Australia Insurance Company Pty Ltd, in the matter of MDU Australia Insurance Company Pty Limited [2008] FCA 342).
