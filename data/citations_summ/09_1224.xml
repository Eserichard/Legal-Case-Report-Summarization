<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 296">It is equally clear that the applicant's argument, at least in relation to the attempted characterisation of the amount in question as an "unpaid net amount", must fail. In Russell v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1224 , Logan J said: 
 
 [254] A remaining issue is whether, insofar as it related to a period prior to 1 July 2002, the issuing of the GST assessment was beyond power. The inspiration for Mr Russell's raising this issue would seem to be the supposed expiration of the 4 year period after which, subject to an exception to which I shall shortly refer, in the absence of a notice from the Commissioner within that period requiring payment, an unpaid net amount together with any related general interest charge ceases to be payable: see s 105-50 of Schedule 1 to the TAA. The exception to this statutory expiration arises where the Commissioner is satisfied that the payment of the amount was avoided by fraud or evasion.</sentence>
