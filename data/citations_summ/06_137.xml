They observed (189 CLR at 154) that '...the ultimate aim of a court is the attainment of justice'. Obviously, s 31A regulates the attainment of justice by creating an entitlement in a party to be protected from claims or defences which fail to meet the threshold prescribed in the section. In granting leave to appeal on a decision involving the application of s 31A, Wilcox J observed in Vans, Inc v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 at [12] that it was arguable that the effect of s 31A was that there could be summary judgment for an applicant '... notwithstanding the possibility that the applicant's case will break down at trial; in other words, it is now not enough for a party resisting a summary judgment application to seek merely to put the other side to proof' (his Honour's emphasis). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2006] FCA 1227">Merck submitted that the section provided a lesser test that the test which applies under the other provisions. It referred to observations of Heerey J in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 , in which his Honour said at [6]: 
 
 s 31A was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeouts (either of claims or defences) than that previously laid down by the High Court&#180;s decisions in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1948) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130, namely that the allegations are 'so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed'.

<sentence id="cs22" from="[2006] FCA 1147">While there is some level of uncertainty as to the burden of the "no reasonable prospect" formulae in s 31A: see e.g. Vans, Inc v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 ; this is not a case in which it is necessary to explore that formula at any length. The claims made against the first and third respondents are doomed to failure as they disclose no reasonable causes of action in any event. The Amended Statement of Claim is itself embarrassing and must be struck out under O 11 r 16. As the applicant has been given every reasonable opportunity to replead and has been given adequate forewarning of what was needed and required, I will not give leave again to further amend the Amended Statement of Claim. Rather I will order the application be dismissed.
