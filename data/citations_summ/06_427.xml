If the managed investment scheme is no longer "operating", the Court's power to order the winding up of a scheme cannot be invoked: see Norman at [75] and [4].

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 852">Owston submits that the s 1324B order is not consequential on the declarations sought and that in terms it can only be consequential on a finding of a breach of the Act. It says that here the order sought is relevantly disconnected from the breach with no sufficient nexus, citing ASIC v McDougall [2006] FCA 427 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 175 at [69] . It says that it is not a remedy in the true sense for the alleged wrong, but amounts, in effect, to advice from ASIC, with the Court's endorsement, to the shareholders concerned. It says that a final determination between the parties of an issue that has no practical consequence between those parties does not convert a hypothetical question into a "matter", otherwise all hypothetical questions would be a "matter" once a contradictor was found.  As Young J in Re McDougall: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v McDougall [2006] FCA 427 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 175 at [55] observed, the courts, since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121 have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important law enforcement purposes: Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 596 at 603; 14 ACLR 644 at 647; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 at [30] - [31]; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561-574. </sentence>

 Introduction 
 
 This is an application by the plaintiff, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (" ASIC "), for winding-up orders against the second defendant, John West &amp; Associates Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) (" JWA ") and an alleged unregistered managed investment scheme (" the scheme "). In the circumstances of the present case, I consider that it is appropriate to make the declarations sought for the following reasons: &#8722; ASIC, in its capacity as the public regulator of the securities and investments markets in Australia, has a real interest in seeking the declarations. The subject of the proposed declarations concerns matters of public interest, [73] and the grant of declaratory relief serves an important law enforcement purpose; [74] &#8722; the proposed declarations are not abstract or hypothetical. They both formally record the conclusion that the Court has reached, on the evidence, as to the legal consequences of specific conduct of the defendants, [75] and mark the Court's disapproval of the contravening conduct; [76] &#8722; the Court has a substantial body of evidence supporting the findings and conclusions that in turn support the declarations sought by ASIC; [77] &#8722; the defendants engaged in serious and repeated breaches of provisions of the Corporations Act in the conduct of the mortgage investment business and it is right for the Court to so declare. [78] The scheme involved high risks, the extent of which was not disclosed in any proper way to investors. No proper books and records were kept by Mr West and JWA; [79] and &#8722; no embarrassment or legal or practical injustice to non-parties by the declarations being granted has been identified. [80]  In the circumstances of the present case, I consider that it is appropriate to make the declarations sought for the following reasons: &#8722; ASIC, in its capacity as the public regulator of the securities and investments markets in Australia, has a real interest in seeking the declarations. The subject of the proposed declarations concerns matters of public interest, [73] and the grant of declaratory relief serves an important law enforcement purpose; [74] &#8722; the proposed declarations are not abstract or hypothetical.

[78] The scheme involved high risks, the extent of which was not disclosed in any proper way to investors. No proper books and records were kept by Mr West and JWA; [79] and &#8722; no embarrassment or legal or practical injustice to non-parties by the declarations being granted has been identified. [80]  In my view, in the circumstances of this case, it is appropriate to grant permanent injunctions against Mr West and JWA in the form sought by ASIC. Neither defendant opposed the permanent injunctive relief sought. The evidence before the Court indicates that Mr West continued the scheme when on notice of potential contraventions of the Corporations Act and attempted to continue the business in another form in the face of court injunctions prohibiting the scheme's continued operation. From this it may be concluded that Mr West is susceptible to repeating his contraventions of the Act. The wider form of injunction is warranted and will serve the public interest. [84]  In the circumstances of the present case, I consider that it is appropriate to make the declarations sought for the following reasons: &#8722; ASIC, in its capacity as the public regulator of the securities and investments markets in Australia, has a real interest in seeking the declarations.

 CLARKE v EDWARDS 
 [2007] SADC 49 


 Introduction 
 
 It is the case for the plaintiff Mr Peter Clarke that in February 2002 the defendant, Mr Phillip Edwards, orally agreed with the plaintiff's agent and accountant, Mr David Abram of David Abram and Associates Pty Ltd (DAAPL), to borrow from the plaintiff the sum of $100,825.00 upon the condition that the loan would be repaid by November 2002. In the alternative, the plaintiff contends that the funds were paid to the benefit of the defendant's nephew Peter Edwards and/or two offshore investment companies called Coppertone Investments Limited (CIL) and Smart Goal Investments Limited (SGIL) and that the defendant agreed to indemnify the plaintiff if the funds were not repaid by the due date. In short a Ponzi scheme operates on the "rob Peter to pay Paul principle". Funds received from new investors are used to pay out existing investors or to pay interest on money advanced by existing investors until the scheme collapses. [5] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2006] FCA 1415">74 I also think that the observations of Owen J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Chase Capital Management Pty Ltd [2001] WASC 27 ; (2001) 36 ACSR 778 , 796 are apposite. There, in somewhat similar circumstances, Owen J said that "having decided that the schemes should be wound up, the case for the companies to be placed in liquidation becomes compelling. It would inject an air of unreality if the schemes were wound up without the corporate entities that had been part of the operation not also being made the subject of a formal administration. [The failure to do so] would increase the overall costs of the finalisation [of the winding up of the schemes] and would not be in the interests of the creditors. " This passage has been approved in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group [2002] NSWSC 310 ; (2002) 41 ACSR 561 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edwards [2004] QSC 344 ; (2004) 22 ACLC 1469 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McDougall [2006] FCA 427 ; (2006) 229 ALR 158. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2006] NSWSC 735">As was said by Gummow J in ICI at 267, the terms of an injunction granted under s 80 must, on their face, operate upon a range of conduct which has 'the relationship required by s 80 with contravention of the Act. Irrespective of whether the injunction is sought or granted under s 80(1) or 80 (1AA) there must be a nexus between the conduct alleged or found to constitute the relevant contraventions and the injunctions granted. '

84 It was explained and applied to the equivalent power in Corporations Act , s 1321 , by Young J of the Fededral Court in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McDougall [2006] FCA 427: 

 [69] It is implicit in Merkel J's judgment that an injunction under s 80 may extend beyond the specific conduct proven to constitute a contravention by s 80 and may, in appropriate cases, extend to conduct of the same kind or class. There must, however, be a sufficient nexus or relationship between the conduct that is the subject of the restraint and the conduct that was alleged to constitute a contravention of the Act. As French J pointed out in ACCC v Real Estate Institute (WA) [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 95 FCR 114 at 131, the question whether there is a sufficient nexus between the orders sought and the contraventions alleged involves an evaluative judgment by the Court which will depend heavily upon the circumstances of the particular case.</sentence>
