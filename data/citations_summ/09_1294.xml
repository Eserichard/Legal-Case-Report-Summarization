<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 490">I also note that in Re Jacomb (2000) 180 ALR 134 , [2000] FCA 1891 ...Weinberg J (at [9]) appears to have accepted that an applicant in a similar position to Mr Nimmo bears such an onus. I therefore reject Mr Nimmo's counsel's contention on this issue and hold that Mr Nimmo does bear the onus of producing evidence to satisfy me that the irregularities he claims occurred in relation to this election, did happen. 
 

 
See also: Re Asmar, in the matter of an election for offices of the Health Services Union [2009] FCA 1294 at [21] per Tracey J.
  The level of satisfaction required is that prescribed by the legislature; namely, the Court must be "satisfied that there are reasonable grounds" for the application being made. 
 

 
 The comments there made are adhered to. The observations of French J (as His Honour then was) in Re Post and the observations of Kirby J in Re Jarman have also been applied by Tracey J in Re Asmar, in the matter of an election for officers of the Health Services Union [2009] FCA 1294. </sentence>
