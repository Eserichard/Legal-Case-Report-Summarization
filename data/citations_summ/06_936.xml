<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] NSWCA 332">


 
353 The legislative history of s 674 has been set out on other occasions. (See, for example, Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Southcorp Limited [2003] FCA 1369 ; (2003) 130 FCR 406 at [8] - [12] per Lindgren J; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Chemeq Limited [2006] FCA 936 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 169 at [42] - [46] per French J; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Fortescue Metal Group (No 5) at [218]-[219] per Gilmour J; Jubilee Mines NL v Riley [2009] WASCA 62 ; (2009) 69 ACSR 659 at [45] - [54] per Martin CJ. ) We respectfully adopt the historical narrative in these judgments. 572 His Honour's finding that the breach was flagrant was made in the context of the policy underlying the disclosure provisions. In this regard, his Honour said, in respect of s 1001A(2): 
 

 
 
 "... it has been said that the continuous disclosure provisions are intended, amongst other things, to prevent selective disclosure of market sensitive information ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Southcorp Ltd (No 2) [2003] FCA 1369 ; (2003) 130 FCR 406 at 408 [2] ). Protective legislation should be construed beneficially to the public ( Exicom Pty Ltd v Futuris Corporation Ltd (1995) 123 FLR 394 at 397), even if a distinction between ' punitive ' and ' protective ' proceedings or orders is elusive ( Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42 ; (2004) 220 CLR 129 at 145 [32] ). The importance of Section 1001A(2) in terms of public policy is that it seeks to enforce immediate disclosure of information not generally available that might be expected to have a material effect on the price of listed shares.

" (at [179]) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] NSWSC 714">179 If it were appropriate to consider the second limb of those provisions, it has been said that the continuous disclosure provisions are intended, amongst other things, to prevent selective disclosure of market sensitive information ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Southcorp Ltd (No 2) [2003] FCA 1369 ; (2003) 130 FCR 406 at 408 [2] ). Protective legislation should be construed beneficially to the public ( Exicom Pty Ltd v Futuris Corporation Ltd (1995) 123 FLR 394 at 397), even if a distinction between " punitive " and " protective " proceedings or orders is elusive ( Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42 ; (2004) 220 CLR 129 at 145 [32] ). The importance of Section 1001A(2) in terms of public policy is that it seeks to enforce immediate disclosure of information not generally available that might be expected to have a material effect on the price of listed shares. The significance that the legislature places upon continuous disclosure was discussed by French J in Re Chemeq Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Chemeq Ltd [2006] FCA 936; (2006) 234 ALR 511 at 522-523 [42]- [46]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] NSWSC 287">In my view information on an ASIC register that might, on payment of a fee, be searched and might reveal relevant information if the searcher was sufficiently astute to consider name changes and conducted a search for the ABN of JHIL, was not readily observable matter. The legislation aimed at preventing selective disclosure of market sensitive information should not be understood as treating as readily observable a complex series of filings by a private company that had changed its name on a number of occasions. As French J observed in Re Chameq Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Chemeq Ltd [2006] FCA 936 ; (2006) 234 ALR 511 at [46] the importance attached to continuous disclosure by the legislation is emphasised by the penalties for their contravention. That importance should not be downgraded by an entitlement to exemption from disclosure because filings with ASIC required by the legislation for other purposes have been made.
