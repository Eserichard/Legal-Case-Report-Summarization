<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 538">A number of orders were also made in relation to the disposition of costs arising out of various earlier notices of motion filed and agitated by particular parties. I will not repeat the content of those orders in these reasons. The orders are set out together with the reasons in support of those orders in Van Der Velde v Ng [2009] FCA 529. That judgment was delivered ex tempore on 15 April 2009. In the course of those reasons I made these observations: In relation to the first matter concerning the general conduct of the proceedings, there is an area for some, I have to say, considerable degree of criticism.</sentence>
