<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 13">However the High Court has also endorsed the position that the Court may draw inferences from the Tribunal's decision record as to whether the Tribunal considered any information to be part of the reason for affirming the delegate's decision. ( SZLFX . See also SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 , SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 , and SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2009] FCAFC 60 ; (2009) 177 FCR 29 ; (2009) 255 ALR 435. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 802">I should just note that an additional argument put by the applicant before the Court at the hearing, at least inferentially, that relied on what the Tribunal eventually found, may have come up against the temporal difficulty for such an argument identified by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [17] as it related to s.424A, and by analogy s.359A. ("Would be" not "what was". ) I note also that Federal Court authority does allow for consideration of the Tribunal's decision record in these circumstances, but only as it may assist in what the Tribunal considers "would be" the reason at some anterior point in time ( SZLPJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1721 at [15] to [16], SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 at [14] to [17] and SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] ). In any event, whatever the situation, this does not assist the applicant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 512">In the current case the applicant has put nothing but the Tribunal's decision record before the Court. However, I agree with Mr May that the Court is able to have regard to the Tribunal's decision record in this regard. (See the subsequent High Court judgment in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZLFX &amp; Anor [2009] HCA 31 ; (2009) 238 CLR 507 (" SZLFX ") at [26]. ) At least for the purpose of making a determination as to whether there was such "information" that the Tribunal considered would be the reason at some point anterior to the making of its decision. (See in this regard SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] ("... that may be a relevant consideration in drawing inferences as to the proper characterisation of that information" per Siopis J), SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 at [15] per Jacobson J ("...But I do not think it follows from what the High Court said in SZBYR that in making an assessment of whether section 424A(1) was engaged, a court can never have regard to the reasons of the Tribunal. "), see also at [16], SZLPJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1721 per Perram J at [15]-[16]. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1198">In SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 , Siopis J observed at [36]: 
 
 It follows that it is the relationship which the information in question has to the content of the Convention claim made by the applicant before the Tribunal that is a significant consideration in determining whether it is information in respect of which s 424A(1) applies. Further, the assessment of whether the information enlivened the obligation on the Tribunal under s 424A(1) is made by reference to the time at which the Tribunal becomes aware of the information. Accordingly, and significantly, in light of the submission made by the first respondent, the assessment is not dependent upon the use that the Tribunal subsequently made of the information, although, in my view, that may be a relevant consideration in drawing inferences as to the proper characterisation of the information (emphasis added). 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 713">Ultimately, in that case I accepted the respondent Minister's argument that regard could be had to the Tribunal's published reasons so long as such a regard was for the purpose of determining what "would be" the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision of the delegate at some point anterior in time to the published reasons. Reliance was placed on SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] per Siopis J, SZMPT per Jacobson J at [14] to [17] (the authority relied on by Mr Reilly in the current case), and SZLPJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1721 per Perram J at [15] --- [16] (see SZBJH at [54] to [56]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 842">It is well established that the question of whether the obligation under s.424A(1) of the Migration Act is enlivened is to be determined in advance and independently of the Tribunal's reasoning on the facts of the particular case, such that the need for " unbundling " of the reasons is correspondingly reduced (see SZBYR at [17] and [22]). Nevertheless it has also been held that in determining whether information is within s.424A(1) , the Court may have regard to the reasons of the Tribunal, not as a starting point but as material relevant to whether an inference should be drawn that the Tribunal considered particular information would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review (see SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] per Siopis J; SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2009] FCA 99 ; (2009) 107 ALD 121 at [17] --- [18] per Jacobson J; SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 51 ; (2009) 255 ALR 407 at [31] and now see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLFX [2009] HCA 31 at [26] ). As the Full Court of the Federal Court pointed out in SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCAFC 198 ; (2007) 164 FCR 578 (at [33]), the obligation under s.424A(1) is only enlivened where the Tribunal forms the opinion that particular information would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 708">In examining whether s.424A is engaged, and in determining what "would be" the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review, SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [17] provides direction, in that the question is to be determined in advance of the Tribunal's published reasons. That is, it is to be determined at the time that the "issue" is formulated in the mind of the Tribunal and not with regard only to the decision record. However, it is the case that reference can be had to the decision record, so long as that reference comprehends that it is for the purpose only of drawing inferences in informing what "would be" the reason or part of the reason at some earlier point in time. (See SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 (per Siopsis J) at [36], SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 (per Jacobson J) at [14] to [17], SZLPJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1721 (per Perram J) at [15] to [16]. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 573">I understood this to mean that this should be done without reference to the Tribunal's decision record. However, other recent Federal Court authorities allow that it is permissible to look at the Tribunal's published reasons for the purpose of drawing inferences as to the proper characterisation of what "would be" "information" for the purposes of s.424A. That is, regard may be had to the Tribunal's decision record so long as such an examination is done with reference to a point in time prior to the Tribunal having conducted its final consideration, and for the purposes of informing what "would be" the reasons at some anterior point in time. (In this regard, see: SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 (" SZMFZ ") per Siopsis J at [36], SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 (" SZMPT ") per Jacobson J at [14] to [17], and SZLPJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1721 (" SZLPJ ") per Perram J at [15] to [16]. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 473">Rather, it is to be determined at the time that the "issue" is formulated in the mind of the Tribunal. In particular, Mr Silva relied on SZBYR at [17]: "...The use of the future conditional tense ("would be") rather than the indicative strongly suggests that the operation of s 424A(1)(a) is to be determined in advance - and independently - of the Tribunal's particular reasoning on the facts of the case ..." This was followed in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 (" MZXBQ ") per Heerey J, a matter in which information relating to a "bond" was referred to by that Tribunal at that hearing, but there was no reference to this issue in a " section 424A letter" sent by the Tribunal. In particular, Mr Silva referred the Court to MZXBQ at [30]: "... Post-SZBYR the correct approach would have been for the Tribunal to consider whether the $20,000 bond information, if true, would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision to refuse the appellant's protection visa application ..." SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 (" SZMFZ ") (per Siopsis J):

 "It follows that it is the relationship which the information in question has to the content of the Convention claim made by the applicant before the Tribunal that is a significant consideration in determining whether it is information in respect of which s 424A(1) applies. Further, the assessment of whether the information enlivened the obligation on the Tribunal under s 424A(1) is made by reference to the time at which the Tribunal becomes aware of the information. Accordingly, and significantly, in light of the submission made by the first respondent, the assessment is not dependent upon the use that the Tribunal subsequently made of the information ..."

 "...Further, I infer from the fact that the Tribunal was able to, and did, ask the appellant questions about this information at the hearing, that it was aware of this information by the commencement of the hearing. " 17. The question of whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision must be a question of fact. As Siopis J observed in SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] : [T]he assessment of whether the information enlivened the obligation on the Tribunal under s 424A(1) is made by reference to the time at which the Tribunal becomes aware of the information. Accordingly, and significantly, in light of the submission made by the first respondent, the assessment is not dependent upon the use that the Tribunal subsequently made of the information, although, in my view, that may be a relevant consideration in drawing inferences as to the proper characterisation of the information.

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 504">It is the case that in SZBYR the High Court suggested, having regard to the use in s.424A(1) of the future conditional tense rather than the indicative, that the test in s.424A(1) was to be applied not by looking at the Tribunal's published reasons, but was to be determined in advance and independently of the Tribunal's particular reasons on the facts of the case. Nonetheless, the Federal Court has made it clear that it is permissible to have regard to the Tribunal's reasons, not as the starting point, but in drawing inferences as to the proper characterisation of information and in determining whether at any anterior time it would be material that the Tribunal considered was the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. (See, for example, SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] , SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 at [17] and SZLPJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1721 at [15] --- [17]. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 413">Jacobson J pointed out in SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 at [17] that the question of whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision must be a question of fact. His Honour referred with approval to the observations of Siopis J in SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] as follows: [T] he assessment of whether the information enlivened the obligation on the Tribunal under s 424A(1) is made by reference to the time at which the Tribunal becomes aware of the information. Accordingly, and significantly, in light of the submission made by the first respondent, the assessment is not dependent upon the use that the Tribunal subsequently made of the information, although, in my view, that may be a relevant consideration in drawing inferences as to the proper characterisation of the information. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FMCA 425">That information was capable of being characterised as information that may undermine the Applicant's claims. It was information given by the Applicant to the Department orally and was therefore not excluded by s.424A(3)(ba) of the Act ( SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [17] ; SZLPJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1721 at [15] and [16] per Perram J; SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] per Siopis J; SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 at [17] - [18] per Jacobson J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FMCA 333">On this basis, in determining whether s.424A(1)(a) was enlivened I have considered what inferences can be drawn from the material available as to the Tribunal's state of mind at the anterior point or points of time as considered in SZLPJ and SZLJF , consistent with SZBYR at [17]. I note in that respect that as Jacobson J observed in SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 at [17] --- [18]: [17] The question of whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision must be a question of fact. As Siopis J observed in SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] : [T]he assessment of whether the information enlivened the obligation on the Tribunal under s 424A(1) is made by reference to the time at which the Tribunal becomes aware of the information. Accordingly, and significantly, in light of the submission made by the first respondent, the assessment is not dependent upon the use that the Tribunal subsequently made of the information, although, in my view, that may be a relevant consideration in drawing inferences as to the proper characterisation of the information. [18] That is to say, in a proper case, the Court, in making its assessment, may draw inferences from the Tribunal's reasons as to whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision. </sentence>
