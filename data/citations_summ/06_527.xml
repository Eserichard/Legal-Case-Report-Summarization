<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 225">The fact that legal costs are included in a lump sum compensation payment was accepted by the Federal Court of Australia in Secretary Department of Employment Workplace Relations v Barrington [2006] FCA 527 at [36] . As Heerey J said in that case, the amount of legal costs can be a relevant factor in assessing whether or not the Secretary should exercise his discretion regarding some payments under s 1184K of the Act. In fact, it is likely that this aspect would become significant where an applicant is not aware of significant legal costs which will need to be met from a lump sum payment. Mr Moumin said that he in fact only received $330,000 of the $350,000 settlement sum, because $20,000 was paid to his lawyers. However, other than Mr Moumin's statement, there was no evidence before me of any additional payment to Mr Moumin's lawyers and the Deed of Release clearly provides for the payment of his lawyers on a party/party basis in addition to the $350,000 settlement sum. For that reason, I do not propose to take into account any additional payment that Mr Moumin may have made to his solicitors. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 600">The fact that legal costs are included in a lump sum compensation payment was accepted by the Federal Court of Australia in Secretary Department of Employment Workplace Relations v Barrington [2006] FCA 527 at [36] . As Heerey J said in that case, the amount of legal costs can be a relevant factor in assessing whether or not the Secretary should exercise his discretion regarding some payments under s 1184K of the Act. In fact, it is likely that this aspect would become significant where an applicant is not aware of significant legal costs which will need to be met from a lump sum payment. Again, that is not the case here. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] VSC 66">The fact that, having taken the PSD into account, the Tribunal reached a conclusion that did not accord with the State's in relation to the question of whether the condition was "not reasonable" does not disclose an error of law. 152 In relation to the State's assertion that the Tribunal should have made a specific finding on the submission contained in paragraph 221 of the State's written submissions to the Tribunal, as it is clear that the Tribunal considered the impact of the PSD on the issues of fact and law before the Tribunal, the fact that the Tribunal did not specifically refer to paragraph 221 of the State's written submissions does not, in and of itself, disclose an error of law. 153 In light of the above conclusions, it is not necessary for me to consider the suggestion in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Barrington [45] that the principle based on Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [46] that Mr Hanks has relied on (see paragraph 145 of this judgment) may no longer be good law in light of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affai [47] v Yusuf.47
154 For completeness, I note that in paragraphs 553 to 568 of the Substantive Decision, the Tribunal discussed the key features of the recently introduced LSP and concluded, first, that there was no evidence that the LSP was used to help Ms Turner in the period of the claim and, second, that the extent to which the LSP could assist a student like Ms Turner with a severe learning disorder is not known. The State did not seek to impugn the Tribunal's conclusions in relation to the LSP. 155 For the above reasons, I find that the Tribunal did not err in relation to the eleventh question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] VSC 325">34 In relation to the Dennis Willcox principle, in light of the above conclusions and Mr Hanks' concession referred to in paragraph 23 of this judgment, it is not necessary for me to consider questions such as whether the relevant submission was seriously advanced before the Tribunal and worthy of serious consideration. Nor do I need to consider the suggestion in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [17] Barrington17 that Dennis Willcox may no longer be good law in light of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affa [18] s v Yusuf.18  [12] (1988) 79 ALR 267 , 276-7 (" Dennis Willcox ").

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] AATA 339">There is little to differentiate Mr Groom's circumstances from those in Re Marsh and SDF&amp;CS [2004] AATA 362 where the Tribunal declined to reduce the preclusion period from 2012, where the applicant had squandered settlement monies of $1.1 million over several years. His remaining assets included a modified car valued at $18,000.00 and unencumbered house which had been purchased in 2000 for $95,000.00. The Tribunal refers to a statement by Heerey J in S,DEWR and Barrington (2006) FCA 527 at paragraph 33: 
 "The bare fact of spending compensation money on an asset after becoming aware of a preclusion period would often tell against a finding of special circumstances, as the Guide points out".

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] VSC 9">Certain submissions on behalf of the State that were worthy of serious consideration, especially in relation to the question whether a warning would have been effective, were not addressed. Accordingly, had the point been raised, I would have found error of law in that regard alone.

At the time of that decision s 43(2) was in substantially the same terms as the present subs (2B). Jenkinson J, with whom Woodward and Foster JJ agreed, said at 276-277 
 
 
 
 
 "There is also the further possibility that the Tribunal's failure to mention either the submission or the questions of fact which it raises was the result of a failure, by inadvertence, to consider the submission when the tribunal was engaged in deciding the reference.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] AATA 847">In is also relevant to note the observations of Heerey J in Secretary Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Barrington [2006] FCA 527 that legal costs of $46,500 (in this case) were not for far short of a year's income for someone on average weekly earnings (currently $53,500).</sentence>
