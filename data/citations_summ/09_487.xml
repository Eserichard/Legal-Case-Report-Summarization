<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 884">Although there is some authority for the proposition that costs ought to follow the event in the context of successful applications by unsuccessful candidates in challenging the declaration of a poll ( Free v Kelly and Another [1996] HCA 42 ; (1996) 185 CLR 296 ; Scott-Irving v Oakeshott and Others [2009] FCA 487 ; (2009) 256 ALR 442) , I am not satisfied that a costs order ought to be made against Mr Faulkner in the circumstances of this application. This is an application by a candidate in the course of an election campaign. The conduct is said to materially affect Mr Faulkner as a candidate and although Mr Faulkner has not been able to establish a contravention of the Electoral Act , I am satisfied that the public interest is served by enabling Mr Faulkner to quickly come before the Court without facing the burden of a costs order. I accept that Mr Faulkner believes in the merits of his contentions notwithstanding that he has not been able to demonstrate a contravention of the Act. The orders will be that Application QUD 334 of 2010 is dismissed with no order as to costs. </sentence>
