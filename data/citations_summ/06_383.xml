<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 478">In Re Skase; Ex Parte Donnelly [1992] FCA 429 ; (1992) 37 FCR 509 at 522, Drummond J treated as applicable certain propositions propounded by Wilcox J in Cummings v Lewis (unreported, Fed Ct, Wilcox J, NG668 of 1989, 29 May 1992): the Court has an unfettered discretion as to its costs order; but, because of the usual practice of the Court, a successful party has a reasonable expectation of recovering costs, in the absence of special circumstances; the Court is entitled to look beyond the actual conduct of the case and have regard to the circumstances out of which it arose; there must be a limitation on the weight to be put on the pre-litigation conduct, lest the exception overwhelm the rule; the Court may take into account the conduct of the litigation by the successful party. Where a successful party has put the opposing party to significant expense in connection with an issue on which the party failed, it may be reasonable to take that matter into account by awarding something less than full party-party costs [4] ; and there is no difference in principle between the case of a successful applicant and that of a successful respondent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NTMC 23">Further, in Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw (No 2) [2006] FCA 383 , Kenny J summarised the relevant propositions as follows (para 11 and 12): &ldquo;A successful litigant is ordinarily entitled to an award of costs: see eg.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 433">The party seeking indemnity costs on the basis of a Calderbank offer must generally show that the rejection of the offer was so unreasonable as to justify such an order: Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw (No 2) [2006] FCA 383. </sentence>
