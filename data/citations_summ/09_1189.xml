<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 277">Notice having been given, approval is now sought pursuant to s 33V and the " general power " conferred by s 33ZF. Section 33V provides as follows: 
 
 Settlement and discontinuance --- representative proceeding 
 (1) A representative proceeding may not be settled or discontinued without the approval of the Court. (2) If the Court gives such an approval, it may make such orders as are just with respect to the distribution of any money paid under a settlement or paid into the Court. 
 

 
The purpose to be served by s 33V has been said to be " obvious ": Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258. Branson J there observed: 
 
 
 The purpose intended to be served by s 33V(1) is obvious. It is appropriate for the court to be satisfied that any settlement or discontinuance of representative proceedings has been undertaken in the interests of the group members as a whole, and not just in the interests of the applicant and the respondent. In my view, s 33V proscribes not only complete settlement of proceedings without the approval of the court, but also settlement of claims against a joint respondent, or settlement of any substantive claim against a respondent.
