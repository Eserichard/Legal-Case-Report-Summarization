<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 359">I agree with Mr Johnson's submission that it cannot be that an Applicant's own fraud or a fraud to which he is a party would result in the Tribunal's decision being set aside. It would be absurd if all knowingly false claims were incapable of being the subject of a valid refusal. ( NAWZ at [118]; SZHTW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [18] ; SZGJO v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [19] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 1349">29. After the hearing, and in response to a request from the court, the first respondent filed further written submissions in relation to authorities concerning the effect of s.98 of the Act as follows: 
 
 
 The decision of Smith FM in Shen v MIMIA [2004] FMCA 693 deals with section 98. At paragraph [3], His Honour stated that: 
 
 
 
 
 The delegate's decision, which was affirmed by the Tribunal, applied a power conferred by s.109 of the Migration Act after deciding that " there was non-compliance by the holder of a visa " and after " having regard to " the list of discretionary considerations prescribed in Migration Regulation 2.41. The allegation of "non-compliance" which was found to be established was a failure to comply with the requirement of s.101 that " a non-citizen must fill in his or her application form in such a way that ... no incorrect answers are given . " The effect of ss.98, 100 and 111 is that a breach of this obligation can occur if an application form is filled in by someone else on behalf of the applicant, even if the applicant did not know that the answer was incorrect, and whether the non-compliance was deliberate or inadvertent. ... 
 
 
 
 
 The other cases that refer to section 98 include: SZGJO v MIMIA [2006] FCA 393 ; NAWZ v MIMIA [2004] FCAFC 199 at [17] ; SZHLY v MIMIA [2006] FMCA 771 at [28] ; SZHTW v MIMIA [2006] FCA 1086 at [26] ; and SZBIV v MIMIA [2006] FCA 56
