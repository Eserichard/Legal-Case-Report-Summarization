<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 99">Those contentions are misconceived. First, in a related matter Norman v FEA Plantation Ltd [2010] FCA 1274 ; (2010) 191 FCR 39 , Finkelstein J determined that the Receivers do not owe duties to the growers under s 601 FD(1)(c) of the Act. His Honour also determined that, even if the Receivers were under the duties imposed by s 601FD(1) , that would not assist the growers because a duty to act in the best interests of the growers could not be a justification for the responsible entity or its officers to ignore bargains freely entered into: see also in that regard Re Exceel; Worthley v England (1994) 52 FCR 69 at 86---87; Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1493 ; (2006) 64 ATR 524 at [39] ; Forest Marsh Pty Ltd v Pleash (2011) 82 ACSR 164 at [81]. The growers were a party to that application and did not appeal from his Honour's orders. Moreover, we are not persuaded that his Honour erred in the ultimate conclusion to which he came. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 134">The security document may well impose or provide for, as here, a broad range of liabilities and obligations on the part of the mortgagor or chargor for the benefit of the secured creditor extending beyond what might be ordinarily understood as being "the secured debt". Indeed, as I will later describe, the applicants' submissions, in effect, give the expression "the secured debt" (as used by them) a somewhat limited meaning in light of the liabilities and obligations that were actually imposed on the first applicant by the charge. And, plainly, the primary duty of the receiver is to the mortgagee or chargee under the mortgage or charge in respect of which he or she has been appointed: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1493 ; (2006) 64 ATR 524 at [39] . If, therefore, by their formulation, the applicants seek to allege the existence of a duty that differs in scope to the duty stated by Needham J in Expo , then I would reject the applicants' formulation of the duty. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] NSWSC 817">50 The receivers' lien does not depend on the continuation of possession by them. It may be asserted in respect of the assets the subject of the receivership even though the receivership has been discharged and control of the assets has reverted to their owner: Mellor v Mellor [1992] 1 WLR 517. At the same time, however, the receivers may resist removal and delivery up of assets in their possession while a claim to be indemnified for which the lien stands as security remains unsatisfied: Hill v Venning (1979) 4 ACLR 555. As a corollary (and as was pointed out by counsel for the receivers in the present case), it was held in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission; Re Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd (2006) 64 ATR 524 ; [2006] FCA 1493 that it is within the power of retiring receivers to retain a provision out of the assets they hold against a threatened claim. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] WASC 155">76 The third principal issue is whether the Receivers are entitled to realise assets of the Chargors to create a fund to satisfy the future potential liabilities of the Chargors to ING. The Receivers submit that they have a common law right, independent of any contractual arrangements between ING and the defendants, to retain a fund against the potential costs of defending litigation brought against them by a chargor. In support of that contention the Receivers cite ASIC v Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1493 ; (2006) 64 ATR 524 [49] and F &amp; G Nominees Pty Ltd v Coxon [2007] WASC 113 ; (2007) 34 WAR 55 [23] - [27]. Those two cases concerned the rights of a receiver or controller appointed by the court, not a receiver appointed out of court. The Receivers submit further that the litigation in COR 223 of 2009 is, in effect, an action seeking an account from the Receivers and the general rule is that a mortgagee who is threatened by the mortgagor with contested accounts is entitled to retain its costs of the accounts: Project Research Pty Ltd v Permanent Trustee of Australia Ltd (1990) 5 BPR 11 ,225, 11, 230; Equus Financial Services Pty Ltd v RMBL Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 7 BPR 14 ,966; (1996) 22 ACSR 744 , 14,968; Nidamon Pty Ltd v Wayland (Unreported, NSWCA, 15 April 1994) 17 - 18; Overton Investments Pty Ltd v Cuzeno RVM Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 27 [63].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] VSC 225">213 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Re Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd (receivers and managers appointed) [237] French J stated: 
 
 Section 423(1)(a) of the Act provides for a process of inquiry by the Court where it appears to the Court that a controller of property of a corporation has not faithfully performed, or is not faithfully performing, the controller's functions. Section 423(1)(b) allows an inquiry upon a complaint by a person to the Court. Either process requires a substantive application. The orders sought, by minute filed at the commencement of this application and of which the receivers had notice, did not in terms seek an inquiry. [238] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] WASC 296">26 The other matter to which the receivers refer are threats of prospective litigation. There have been threats made against the receivers of Bowesco by those who stand behind the company that litigation would be commenced against the receivers in relation to the conduct of their receivership. The history of this is recorded in the reasons of French J (as his Honour then was) in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1493 [34] - [35]. French J accepted that the receivers have a realistic apprehension that the directors of Bowesco might institute proceedings against them in respect of the conduct of the receivership. His Honour recorded that, even if meritless, the proceedings would involve the receivers incurring substantial legal costs which might not be recoverable against the companies or other parties. His Honour further accepted that a provision of $650,000 against the costs the receivers might incur in resisting such proceedings was reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] WASC 113">Retention fund 
 23 In Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission; Re Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1493, two companies, Lanepoint and Bowesco, had threatened legal proceedings against the receivers and managers appointed to those companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] FCA 1828">1 This is an application which is made pursuant to s 1321 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). French J required this application to be made pursuant to O 2 of the orders that he made on 10 November 2006, in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission; In the Matter of Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd ACN 110 693 251 v Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd ACN 110 693 251 [2006] FCA 1493 when he ordered that:
 
 'Upon the filing and service by Bowesco Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager Appointed) of an application seeking an order pursuant to s 1321 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) appealing against the refusal by the receivers and managers of the respondent to make provision for Bowesco's legal expenses in connection with proceedings relating to an option assigned to Bowesco by Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd, the receivers and managers of the respondent make provision for the payment of Bowesco's reasonable legal expenses in connection with the prosecution of an application for leave to appeal and any consequent appeal from the decision of this Court in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 9) [2006] FCA 1425 to a maximum of $50,000, the sum to be paid to be taxed by a Registrar of the Court if not agreed. ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] FCA 1530">15 Forestview has applied for funding for its legal representation in the winding up proceedings on the basis that it requested funding from the receivers and managers and was refused by them. It relies upon ss 423 and 1321 of the Act as the sources of the Court's power to review that refusal and make an order that funding be provided. As in the like case of Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Bowesco Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager Appointed) (No 2) [2006] FCA 1493 , I do not consider that any inquiry pursuant to s 423 of the Act is warranted nor is it an appropriate vehicle for dealing with the question which arises pursuant to the liberty to apply given on 31 August 2006. In Northbourne Developments Pty Ltd v Reiby Chambers Pty Ltd (1989) 19 NSWLR 434 at 438, McLelland J said of the former s 420 of the Companies (New South Wales) Code , which provided for inquiries into complaints relating to liquidators in terms relevantly identical to s 423 of the Act: 
 
 'Section 420 is concerned with aspects of the conduct of liquidators which are liable to attract sanctions or control for what might broadly be described as disciplinary reasons. Although the section applies to any liquidator it has particular significance in the case of a liquidator appointed by the court who is, in that sense, an officer of the court, and to a liquidator whose qualification for office is that he is a registered official liquidator or a registered liquidator with the public accreditation that such registration involves and who is in that sense a public officer. ' 
 

In Belvista Pty Ltd v Murphy (1993) 11 ACSR 628 , his Honour revisited the point in relation to the like provision in s 536 of the former Corporations Law and said (at 630): 
 
 
 'In conclusion, I wish to add that where, as here, a creditor or other interested party wishes to challenge the decision of a person in the position of a scheme administrator, or a liquidator, apparently arrived at in good faith, it is generally inappropriate to utilise the "complaint" provisions of s 536 of the Corporations Law rather than the "appeal" provisions of s 1321. As I observed in Northbourne Developments v Reiby Chambers Pty Ltd [(1989) 18 NSWLR 434 at 438] in relation to the predecessor of s 536, that section is concerned with aspects of the conduct of liquidators and others which are liable to attract sanctions or control for what might be broadly described as disciplinary reasons. ' 
 

I respectfully agree with and adopt what McLelland J said in those two cases in its application to s 423 of the Act. </sentence>
