<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 14">This makes it unnecessary to consider, in the light of the true facts regarding deployment and use, the applicability to the funding agreement of the reasoning and conclusions appearing at [2010] NSWSC 1288 , paragraphs [33] to [38]. I was taken by counsel for the PBL defendants to a number of cases, in addition to those mentioned in that part of the 5 November 2010 reasons, in which opinions have been expressed about the need for confidentiality to be maintained in relation to litigation funding arrangements in the interests of maintaining the integrity of the funded proceedings and thereby protecting the due administration of justice. The cases are Spatialinfo Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2005] FCA 455 , Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Ltd [2005] FCA 588 and Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 449 ; [2009] FCA 449 ; (2009) 180 FCR 1. It is, I think, sufficient to note that, in each of those cases, the funding agreement was regarded as confidential, to some extent at least, on grounds of improper tactical advantage inimical to the due administration of justice. That being so and in the light of my decision on the privilege question, I say no more about that aspect.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] SADC 126">It looks not at the dominant purpose of the document itself but, rather, whether there is matter contained within it that would be privileged. It could be said that that argument is necessarily circuitous because it is difficult to apply the dominant-purpose-of-a-whole-document test to 'matter' contained within a document. The nearest assistance I have gained to resolving that conundrum is found in the case of Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners PL (No 2) [13] , where Finkelstein J (albeit speaking about advice privilege) at [3] identified the bare criteria that will qualify a communication for privilege, namely, that it must be:
 
 
 (a) confidential; (b) of a professional nature; and (c) made with the intention of obtaining or giving legal advice ... The advice given or sought need not be confined to matters of legal principle. It may include advice as to what should or should not be done in a "relevant legal context" ... is not confined to telling the client the law ... 
 

He went on to point to criteria which distinguished litigation privilege, noting that:
 
(a) in most common law jurisdictions, advice privilege, unlike litigation privilege, does not extend to communications with third parties;
 
(b) At [7]:
 
 
 Another difference is that litigation privilege provides protection to a wider range of communications. THE LEGAL PRACTITIONERS CONDUCT BOARD v WHARFF [2009] SADC 126 (20 November 2009)
