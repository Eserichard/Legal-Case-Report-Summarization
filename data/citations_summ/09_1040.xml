<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 927">So far as the law governing these circumstances is concerned, I refer with respect generally to the judgment of Kenny J in Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No.4) [2009] FCA 1040 ; (2009) 189 IR 304 at pages 326 to 329. I respectfully adopt and incorporate her Honour's reasoning as part of my own. In particular, however, I refer to paragraphs [113] to [114] of her Honour's judgment, which I will read out: "[113] The usual practice is that costs follow the event, with the result that the court will order the recovery of costs by a successful party on a party and party basis. The matter of costs is, however, in the general discretion of the court, although the discretion must be exercised judicially, that is, in a principled way by reference to the litigation: see Ruddock v Vadarlis (No.2) (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234 at [9]-[10]. [114] In some circumstances, the usual rule will be found wanting and success on a portion only of a claim may make it reasonable for the litigant to bear the expense of the portion in which the litigant failed. Sometimes too, an otherwise successful litigant may be ordered to pay the costs of the other party in respect of the issues on which that litigant failed. As Black CJ and French J said in Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) 115 FCR 229 at 236 at [15]: "Usually the circumstances in which a successful party is denied all or part of its costs have to do with his conduct of the proceedings.

The penalties imposed by the trial judge were:
 
 
 [1] A penalty of $18,500 be imposed on [the first appellant] the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union in respect of the contravention of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) at Mount Street, Heidelberg on 15 February 2006. 
 
 
 
 [2] A penalty of $18,500 be imposed on the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union in respect of the contravention of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) at Mount Street, Heidelberg on 17 February 2006. 
 
 
 
 [3] A penalty of $38,500 be imposed on the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union in respect of the contravention of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) at Mount Street, Heidelberg on 21 February 2006. 
 
 
 
 [4] A penalty of $2,500 be imposed on [the second appellant] Bob Mates in respect of the contravention of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) at Mount Street, Heidelberg on 15 February 2006. 
 
 
 
 [5] A penalty of $2,500 be imposed on Bob Mates in respect of the contravention of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) at Mount Street, Heidelberg on 17 February 2006. 
 
 
 
 [6] A penalty of $5,000 be imposed on Bob Mates in respect of the contravention of s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) at Mount Street, Heidelberg on 21 February 2006. 
 

The maximum penalty for each contravention was $110,000 for the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (the CFMEU ) and $22,000 for Mr Bob Mates, an employee and officer of the CFMEU.  5 In the penalty judgment ([2009] FCA 1040 at [74]), her Honour dealt with the appellants' submission that the events of February 2006 should be seen as one multifaceted course of conduct in the following passage:
 The contraventions on 15, 17 and 21 February 2006 had the same purpose, namely, to coerce Hardcorp to re-employ Messrs Deans and O'Donnell and Ms Singleton at the Mount Street site and, amongst other things, to have Ms Singleton appointed as OH&amp;S officer on the Mount Street site. This was the common thread running through the offending conduct of 15, 17 and 21 February 2006. To this extent, the comparison with Hamberger v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2002] FCA 585 is justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 48">The relevant considerations in assessing an appropriate penalty for breaches of the BCII Act have been extensively discussed by this Court; see eg, Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2008) 177 IR 61 ; [2008] FCA 1426 at [40] per Tracey J; Temple v Powell [2008] FCA 714 ; (2008) 169 FCR 169 at [56] ---[78] per Dowsett J and Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 4) [2009] FCA 1040 at [9] ---[10] per Kenny J.
