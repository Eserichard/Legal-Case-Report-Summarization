<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWCA 250">The applicant submitted that a "blanket exclusion" of the work in this category as work concerning only his personal performance was not appropriate. He submitted that ASIC required information concerning the administration, and that the work of providing the information "would in the ordinary course of things attract a right to remuneration in relation to providing that material unless there is some clear and pressing reason why that would not be the case". He relied on Mirror Group Newspapers Plc v Maxwell (No 2) (1998) 1 BCLC 638 and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Piggott Wood &amp; Baker [2006] FCA 1774.

 Judgment 

 GILES JA : The applicant is the special purpose liquidator of One.Tel Ltd. His remuneration would ordinarily be fixed by the committee of inspection pursuant to s 499(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 (C'th) ("the Act ") as it stood prior to the amendments by the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Act 2007 . He contended that fixing his remuneration pursuant to s 499(3) had proved unworkable, and applied to the Court for determination of his remuneration under s 511 of the Act as a question arising in the winding up.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1796">1 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Piggott Wood &amp; Baker (a firm) [2006] FCA 1774 I upheld the Liquidator's claim for remuneration for work done and expenses incurred in responding to requests by ASIC for information as to the progress of the winding up. I directed the parties to file written submissions on costs. Notwithstanding the very tight time frame dictated by the onset of the long vacation, the parties have provided concise and well argued submissions, for which I thank them.</sentence>
