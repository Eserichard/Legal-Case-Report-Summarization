<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 361">It has long been settled law that a judgment in respect of a strike-out motion, regardless of in whose favour made and regardless of whether it is on all or less than all claims, is an interlocutory order from which no appeal may be taken without leave: Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 , 4. With respect to summary judgment, in contrast, what emerges from the fractured reasons for decision in Jefferson Ford is a majority view that, in some cases, an order granting summary judgment is final and appellable as of right.
