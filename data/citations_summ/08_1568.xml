<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1117">In Boumelhem v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1568 Graham J said at [23]: 
 
 It was common ground between the parties that, for the applicants to secure a stay of proceedings under Order 52 rule 17 of the Federal Court Rules , it would be necessary for the applicants to establish an arguable case in respect of the grounds of appeal identified in their Notices of Appeal and, also, that the balance of convenience favoured the granting of the relevant stays. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1013">The considerations relevant to the exercise of the discretion to grant a stay are well settled. The Court must consider whether an arguable ground has been raised on the appeal and whether the balance of convenience favours the granting of a stay: Freeman v National Australia Bank Limited [2002] FCA 427 per Spender J at [4]; Boumelhem v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1568 ; (2008) 171 FCR 462 per Graham J at [23]; Reynolds v Aluma-Lite Products Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 322 per Spender J at [10]; cf Rigg v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2001] FCA 1340 at [31] and Burns v AMP Finance Ltd [2005] FCA 761 at [5] as to whether, as a matter of practice, evidence of the financial position of the applicant for the stay is necessary in order for the discretion to be exercised favourably. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 322">It is common ground that this Court has power to entertain that stay application. It is also common ground that the relevant considerations in determining whether a stay of proceedings should be granted are whether there is an arguable point on the proposed appeal and whether the balance of convenience favours the granting of a stay: Freeman v National Australia Bank Limited [2002] FCA 427 ; Boumelhem v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1568 ; (2008) 171 FCR 462 at 467, at [23] of that judgment. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1111">It is settled law that a court in bankruptcy will be reluctant to make a sequestration order against a debtor when the primary debt in respect of which the order is sought is still the subject of an appeal, particularly when it is the subject of an appeal of first instance, i.e. an appeal to the court immediately superior to the court in which the decision was made; Ahern v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1987] FCA 312 ; 76 ALR 137. But this principle is not one in respect of which there can be no variation and this court has in the past been prepared to make sequestration orders even though there is an extant appeal. See Boumelhem v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1568 and Sexton v Tagget [2007] FMCA 1438. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 601">

 
 As also noted by their Honours, the question as to whether there was any " error " which attracted the power to invoke the " slip rule " is a question of fact: [2006] FCAFC 149 at [68] . With respect, the same reservation is also expressed as to ability to correct an " error " pursuant to O 35 r 7 by extending the duration of a petition in the face of the express statutory terms of s 52(5). Notwithstanding that reservation, it is the case that other authorities have endorsed the existence of a power to extend time after the initial 12 month period has expired and where there has been an accidental slip or omission in failing to make an application within the time prescribed by s 52(5): Matthews v Collett [2000] FCA 224 ; Bankstown Grammar School Ltd v Park [2000] FCA 1205 ; Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 , 246 ALR 175 ; Boumelhem v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA [2008] FCA 1568 ; 1568 , 171 FCR 462. </sentence>
