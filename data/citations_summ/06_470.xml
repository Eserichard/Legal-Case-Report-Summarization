<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 584">The relevant authorities are very usefully set out by Allsop J in Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470. He cited the statement of Gibbs J in Re Schmidt; Ex parte Anglewood Pty Ltd (1968) 13 FLR 111 that: 40 ... As a general rule this Court is not an appropriate forum to decide such a claim and is limited to forming a view as to whether it appears that there is sufficient validity in the debtor's claim to justify a dismissal or adjournment of the petition ... 
Allsop J then described the task of a bankruptcy court: 
 
 44 It may be that the fourth sentence of the above passage in St George Bank Ltd v Helfenbaum is open to debate as to whether it states the matter slightly too unequivocally in the light of what was said in Ling v Enrobook . Nevertheless, what is clear is that the fact that there has been an act of bankruptcy does not make the claim by the debtor against the petitioning creditor irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 627">In these circumstances the fact of the amounts owed to Mr Donnelly for work he has done does not amount to sufficient cause to override the rights of the creditor to have its debt paid. It is relevant to have regard to the fact that the debt that was the judgment debt has been in existence for some considerable time. I have borne in mind that, as contended for by the creditor, and as discussed in Re Svir; Ex parte Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 83 FCR 314 ; [1998] FCA 503 (and see the useful summary of that case by Allsop J (as he then was) in Totev v Sfar (2006) 230 ALR 236 ; [2006] FCA 470) , this is the bankruptcy jurisdiction. The court has to keep in mind not only the interests of the parties before it in an individual case, but also the public interest which may be adversely affected by the propping up of insolvency. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 484">A convenient and succinct review of the authorities was addressed by his Honour Smith FM in his decision in Bank of Western Australia Ltd &amp; Anor v Loiterton (No.2) [2006] FMCA 821 ; (2006) 230 ALR 339 where his Honour states: [57] The authorities which have guided me in this decision include the principal that Allsop J has recently referred to in Totev v Sfar (2006) 230 ALR 236 ; [2006] FCA 470: [37] On proof of the matters in s 52(1) of the Act, the court will generally proceed to make an order for sequestration. It is for the debtor to persuade the court that the public interest in the dealing with the insolvent debtor and the rights of individual creditors are outweighed by other considerations. [Citation omitted] [58] His Honour cites Cain v Whyte [1932] HCA 6 ; (1933) 48 CLR 639 at 645---6, where the Full Court approved dicta of Henchman J which included: I rule then that I am fully entitled to examine the contention put forward by Mr Philp on behalf of the debtor that there is, in the present case, other sufficient cause sufficient to justify the dismissal of this petition.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FMCA 437">The authorities that the court should consider when deciding whether or not to set aside a petition or grant an adjournment in circumstances such as this, are familiar. They have been gathered with some authority by Sundberg J in St George Bank Limited v Helfenbaum [1999] FCA 1337. That case has itself been applied in numerous others, e.g. Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 ; Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 ; Field v St George [2009] FCA 1042. An applicant is required to satisfy the court that it has a claim against the petitioning creditor that has at least reasonable prospects of success in order for the court to set aside the petition but as French J, as part of the Full Court Spender, French and Cowdroy JJ said in Rigg v Baker at [66]: "A distinction has been drawn between a claim against the petitioner creditor which is likely to succeed and which would warrant refusal of a sequestration order and a "real claim" which has sufficient prospect to warrant the debtor being granted an opportunity to have it litigated. In the latter case an adjournment of the petition may be appropriate. In the matter of Douglas Dragan Jovanovic; Slavko Govedarica &amp; Anor v Douglas Dragan Jovanovic (1998) FCA 463 citing Re James, ex parte Carter Holt Harvey Roofing (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 2) (1994) 51 FCR 14 at [22] (Olney J): The existence of a cross-claim against a petitioning creditor, which is likely to succeed, may support the proposition that the sequestration order ought not to have been made and should be annulled. On the other hand, the existence of a real claim, which might have warranted an adjournment, would not necessarily support that conclusion. This is not to exclude the possibility that in an appropriate circumstances, the Registrar or Judge hearing the petition ought to grant to an adjournment on the basis of a "real cross-claim". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] FMCA 264">A creditor's petition should not be dismissed on the ground of a possible claim against the petitioning creditor, unless the proposed action is one with sufficient prospects of success. As Allsop J indicated in Totev v Sfar and Another (2006) 230 ALR 236 ; [2006] FCA 470 at [44] the proposed cross-claim is not heard in the bankruptcy court, but " the material is examined for the purpose " of assessing the " likelihood of success ". His Honour outlined the law in relation to " other sufficient cause " in some detail and pointed out (at [37]) that: On proof of the matters in s 52(1) of the Act, the court will generally proceed to make an order for sequestration. It is for the debtor to persuade the court that the public interest in the dealing with the insolvent debtor and the rights of individual creditors are outweighed by other considerations: Cain v Whyte [1932] HCA 6 ; (1933) 48 CLR 639 at 645---6 and 648. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2011] FCA 186">The federal magistrate rejected the submissions. He pointed to the delay in instituting the pending Supreme Court proceedings against the background of the long history of unsuccessful litigation against the bank that preceded it. He referred to the requirement that Mr and Mrs Watts show that the claim was likely to succeed, not only that it had reasonable prospects of success, relying on the authorities discussed by, and the analysis of, Allsop J in Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 , (2006) 230 ALR 23 at [37] - [45] . The judgment in Totev v Sfar was overturned on appeal but not on this question: Totev v Sfar [2008] FCAFC 35 ; (2008) 167 FCR 193. His Honour also exposed a fundamental, indeed fatal, problem with the expert evidence upon which Mr and Mrs Watts relied. I am unable to discern any error in his Honour's reasons. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 804">Ground 3 of the notice of opposition is obscure. An affidavit by Mr Shephard makes general assertions in highly inadmissible terms about the creditors and Mr Shephard's past disputes with them. However, these disputes have been fully addressed in the previous litigation history narrated by Driver FM. Moreover, Driver FM was not satisfied for the purposes of s.40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act that Mr Shephard had a "genuine claim" against the creditors for the purposes of setting aside the bankruptcy notice. This applied a lower test than the tests which the Court applies when deciding whether claims against the creditor provide "other sufficient cause" for declining to make a sequestration order under s.52(2)(b). These require the Court to be satisfied that claims are likely to succeed and are well advanced in pending litigation (see the authorities cited and discussed by Allsop J in Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 , (2006) 230 ALR 23). The evidence presented by Mr Shephard in relation to his asserted claims against the creditors is very far from satisfying either of these tests. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FMCA 687">Once I consider that Kevin Liprini is entitled to rely upon the terms of the consent orders to explain or establish the debt relied upon in the petition, I am not satisfied that discretionary reasons for declining to make a sequestration order or adjourning a petition under s.52. (2)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act arise from any of the circumstances of the mediation pointed to by Dr Liprini. Dr Liprini has certainly not, in my opinion, put material before the Court showing he has claims that deserve to be litigated further against Kevin Liprini or any other persons, including all or any of Dr Liprini's own lawyers. This is applying either the "likely to succeed test" and also the "real claim test" required to support a further adjournment of the proceedings (see the authorities cited by Allsop J in in Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 , (2006) 230 ALR 23 at [37]- [45]). The orders of Nicholas J made on 10 July 2009

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FMCA 623">The principles upon which the existence of an "other sufficient cause" have been addressed in many authorities. I often gain assistance from the judgment of Allsop J in Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 , (2006) 230 ALR 23 , where from [37]-[45] his Honour very usefully, with respect, extracts relevant passages from the authorities and elucidates them further with his own discussion. His Honour commenced by citing authority for the proposition that: 37 On proof of the matters in s 52(1) of the Act, the Court will generally proceed to make an order for sequestration. It is for the debtor to persuade the Court that the public interest in the dealing with the insolvent debtor and the rights of individual creditors are outweighed by other considerations.

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCA 1169">Counsel for ICM referred me to Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 ; [2006] FCA 470 ; (2006) 230 ALR 236 at [37] - [44] ( Totev ) where Allsop J, when a judge of this Court, discussed, inter alia, the matters that a debtor must prove in order to establish "other sufficient cause" within s 52(2)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act . An appeal relating to that decision, Totev v Sfar [2008] FCAFC 35 ; (2008) 167 FCR 193 , is not of present relevance. Importantly, counsel submitted that I could not be satisfied that the claim made by Mr Young in the 2007 DC Proceeding was likely to be determined at any time in the near future. The fact was that Mr Young wished to file a significantly amended pleading in the 2007 DC Proceeding and counsel for ICM said that this would prompt a request for particulars. His submission was that allowing for amendment of the pleadings, the supply of particulars, a revised discovery in the light of amended pleadings, and preparation for trial, the 2007 DC Proceeding, assuming against ICM that it would succeed, could not be regarded as being likely to yield funds for the payment of Mr Young's creditors in anything like the near future so to overcome his present insolvency. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FCA 1042">Following this review of the background to the creditor's petition and Mr Field's notice of opposition, the Federal Magistrates Court (at [21]-[23]) referred to the analysis of authorities by Allsop J in Totev v Sfar (2006) 230 ALR 236 ; [2006] FCA 470 at [37] - [44] as useful, particularly Allsop J's observation at [44] in these terms: 
 
 ...what is clear is that the fact that there has been an act of bankruptcy does not make the claim by the debtor against the petitioning creditor irrelevant. It should be examined to assess whether it can be said that there is sufficient evidence to show that it is a real claim which is likely to succeed. Also relevant is the stage of the litigation, the length of time for its vindication and any other relevant matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FMCA 519">The Court's discretion to dismiss a petition on the ground that pending litigation by the debtor against the petitioning creditor provides 'other sufficient cause' for which 'a sequestration order ought not be made' has been explored in many authorities. They were, with respect, very helpfully identified and discussed by Allsop J in Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 at [37] - [44] . He identifies the starting point as: On proof of the matters in s.52(1) of the Act, the Court will generally proceed to make an order for sequestration. It is for the debtor to persuade the Court that the public interest in the dealing with the insolvent debtor and the rights of individual creditors are outweighed by other considerations. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCA 601">Centrally relevant to whether a sequestration order may be made are the financial circumstances of the debtor. Section 52(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) thus provides as follows: 
 If the Court is not satisfied with the proof of any of those matters, or is satisfied by the debtor: 
 (a) that he or she is able to pay his or her debts; or 
 (b) that for other sufficient cause a sequestration order ought not to be made; 
 it may dismiss the petition. 

 
" Other sufficient cause " may include a claim sounding in money by the debtor against a petitioning creditor: Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 , 230 ALR 236.  The reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate who made the sequestration order in September 2008 referred to the Statement of Claim and relevantly concluded: 
 [6] ... It is pleaded with some detail, but its merits and prospects of success are not immediately apparent, and there is no sufficient evidence before me that there would be "other sufficient cause" for the Court to decline in its discretion to make a sequestration order, pursuant to principles such as were discussed by Allsop J in Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470. I am not satisfied that the debtor has shown that she has a claim against the applicant exceeding the amount of the debt relied on in the petition, which is "likely to succeed" and is being pursued with sufficient expedition. 

 
The decision of the Federal Magistrate whose decision is now under appeal referred to the earlier September 2008 decision and concluded:
 
 [15] There has been no appeal to the Federal Court from his Honour's judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 1638">Neither is the existence of the District Court proceedings a reason why the sequestration order should not have been made. Smith FM dealt with those proceedings in the following terms: 6. The evidence which was before Raphael FM contained the debtor's statement of claim in the District Court alleging professional negligence by the applicant. It is pleaded with some detail, but its merits and prospects of success are not immediately apparent, and there is no sufficient evidence before me that there would be " other sufficient cause " for the Court to decline in its discretion to make a sequestration order, pursuant to principles such as were discussed by Allsop J in Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470. I am not satisfied that the debtor has shown that she has a claim against the applicant exceeding the amount of the debt relied on in the petition, which is " likely to succeed " and is being pursued with sufficient expedition. 7. In any event, as was submitted by the applicant, the debtor was on notice from the proceedings before Raphael FM and from his orders, that if she wished to raise and pursue an opposition to the petition it was necessary to comply with the Bankruptcy Rules in relation to the filing of a notice of grounds of opposition and evidence. This has not occurred. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FMCA 1569">In the present matter, Amex is in the position of a creditor referred to in Cain v Whyte [1932] HCA 6 ; (1933) 48 CLR 639 , cited by Allsop J in Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 at [37] : On proof of the matters in s 52(1) of the Act, the Court will generally proceed to make an order for sequestration. It is for the debtor to persuade the Court that the public interest in the dealing with the insolvent debtor and the rights of individual creditors are outweighed by other considerations. (citation omitted) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FMCA 1443">As Allsop J's discussion of that discretion in Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 from [32] onwards points out, the Court will generally proceed to make an Order for sequestration on proof of the matters in s.52(1) of the Act, as has occurred here. His Honour cited the well known statement in Cain v Whyte [1932] HCA 6 ; (1933) 48 CLR 639 that the discretion to identify other sufficient cause is to be approached: with the full appreciation that, prima facie, on proof of the matters mentioned in sec.56(2), the Court will proceed to make an order for sequestration, and that it is for the debtor to show some cause overriding the interests of the public in the stopping of unremunerative trading and the rights of individual creditors who are unable to get their debts paid to them as they become due. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FMCA 1561">The evidence which was before Raphael FM contained the debtor's statement of claim in the District Court alleging professional negligence by the applicant.

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] FMCA 1204">There are principles in bankruptcy which allow the Court to consider whether a debtor's pending litigation provides sufficient cause for declining to make a bankruptcy order, or for adjourning the petition. The authorities are helpfully extracted and discussed by Allsop J in Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 at [37] and subsequently. As his Honour points out, the established principle under Cain v Whyte [1932] HCA 6 ; (1933) 48 CLR 639 , is that: On proof of the matters in s 52(1) of the Act, the Court will generally proceed to make an order for sequestration. It is for the debtor to persuade the Court that the public interest in the dealing with the insolvent debtor and the rights of individual creditors are outweighed by other considerations.

<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FMCA 775">I dealt with the application first on 5 July 2005 in an ex tempore judgment [1] . Mr Totev appealed to the Federal Court against my decision and was successful in that his Honour Allsop J found that I had erred in two respects in dealing with the review application [2] . Allsop J found that I had erred in directing my consideration of proceedings Mr Totev had been agitating in the District Court of New South Wales against Mr and Mrs Sfar to the question of whether those proceedings amounted to a counter-claim, set off or cross demand of equal or greater value than the judgment debt obtained by Mr and Mrs Sfar against Mr Totev [3] . His Honour found that I should have directed my consideration to the question of whether the District Court proceedings constituted "other sufficient cause" for the purposes of s.52(2)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("the Bankruptcy Act "). His Honour also found that, probably in consequence of that misdirection, I incorrectly found that the District Court proceedings did not have any prospects of success. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FCAFC 35">71 Mr Totev sought judicial review of the making of the sequestration order. The application for review was heard by Federal Magistrate Driver on 5 July 2005 and dismissed on the same day (' the first decision'). However, his Honour's decision was set aside on appeal by a judge of this Court in a judgment delivered on 5 May 2006 (see Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470) because of the Federal Magistrate's finding that the District Court proceedings had no prospects of success. Accordingly, the proceedings were remitted to Driver FM for re-determination.</sentence>

 It is not denied that this cross-claim is one that could not be set up in the original proceedings and therefore, provided it meets the test set out Re James; Ex parte Carter Holt Harvey Roofing (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 183 ; Ebert v Union Trustee Co of Australia Ltd (No. 2) [1960] HCA 50 ; (1960) 104 CLR 346 ; Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd [1980] FCA 78 ; (1980) 44 FLR 135 and Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 then the grounds under that section will have been made out. The question is whether the Statement of Claim, that has been verified by both plaintiffs, fulfils the requirements set out in those cases.
