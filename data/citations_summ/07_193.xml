<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 455">Even if I am wrong in determining that the material is inadmissible the nature of the material is such that I would apply s 135 of the Evidence Act to exclude the evidence because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice to the Plaintiff in not being able to test the material particularly when all that is known of it is that it consists of reports prepared by unnamed persons in various organisations who form a view about financial and economic matters at a given point in time. Whilst I accept that the lack of opportunity to test by cross-examination the material is not automatically fatal to the admissibility of a business record ( Guest v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 193 at [25] ; Forbes at [104]), I consider there would be a sufficient unfair prejudice in the present case to exclude the material. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 649">A passage from the judgment of Heerey J in Guest v Commissioner of Taxation [83] illustrates the principle that the outgoing and the activities directed to the gaining or production of assessable income or of possibly doing so need not be contemporaneous:
 
"71 This issue, which also arises under the carrying on business limb, raises the question whether Mr Guest has shown there was a sufficient nexus between his incurring of interest liabilities in 1998 to 2001 and the blueberry growing business in which, following the appointment of Receivers, he ceased to have any involvement after 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 675">I have noted the absence of witnesses capable of giving evidence as to the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report, and the lack of opportunity of the respondents to test the contents of the report. This is not, however, automatically fatal to the admissibility of a business record. As Heerey J observed in Guest v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 193 at [25]: 
 The terms of s 69(2)(a) do not suggest that it is an essential precondition of admissibility that the "person" in question be identified. The ordinary meaning of the language is that it is sufficient that the person who made the representation, whoever he or she is, had or might reasonably be supposed to have had, personal knowledge of the asserted fact. The policy behind the provision is clear enough. Routine business records, made before any legal proceeding arises or is contemplated (cf the exception in s 69(3)) , have an inherent likelihood of reliability which outweighs the common law's aversion to hearsay evidence where the maker of a statement cannot be tested by cross-examination. The utility of s 69 would be greatly diminished if it were necessary to locate among large organisations, perhaps over a long period of time, persons who made representations, often in circumstances where the practical needs of the organisation did not require any identification at the time the representations were made. 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 276">As it is a question of contract, it has no prescribed form. It depends upon what the parties have agreed or, in the modern world as the following cases illustrate, the creativity of those who put together financing packages and arrangements: see by way of example, Esanda v Burgess [1984] 2 NSWLR 139 ; NZI Capital Corporation Pty Ltd v Child (1991) 23 NSWLR 481 , 489F; Guest v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 193 ; (2007) 65 ATR 815 , 819 at [11]; R v New Queensland Copper Co Ltd [1917] HCA 34 ; (1917) 23 CLR 495 , 496, 501-2 (where the Queensland Government advanced money to a mining company that was to be "repaid out of the profits which shall hereafter be derived by or accrue to the company from the working of the said mines" and was therefore unable to seek to recoup the debt from the assets of the company); Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Sidney Williams (Holdings) Ltd [1957] HCA 1 ; (1957) 100 CLR 95 , 115.7; Inland Revenue Commissioners v Herdman [1969] 1 All ER 495 ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Firth (2002) 120 FCR 450 , 468 and Malouf v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 497 ; (2008) 68 ATR 470 , 477. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 412">1 On 23 February 2007 I delivered reasons substantially upholding Mr Guest's contentions in this matter. I directed that counsel bring in minutes of proposed orders to give effect to the reasons: Guest v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 193. </sentence>
