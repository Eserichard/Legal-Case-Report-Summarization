In expressing these reasons I am proceeding on the basis of the test applicable to justify the grant of leave to serve a proposed foreign party outside Australia under O 8 r 3 as explained by Finn, Weinberg and myself in Ho v Akai Pty Ltd (In liq) [2006] FCAFC 159 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 1526 at [10] ; see too Beluga (No 2) [2008] FCA 1770 ; 251 ALR 620 at 627-628 [32] - [33], namely:

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 153">Mr Gleeson refers to the conclusion drawn by His Honour Rares J in paragraph [35] which states: [35] Of course, these reasons reflect only the conclusions that might be available from a reading of documents tendered effectively by only one side, although BDT has opposed the grant of leave and has, itself, tendered some evidence. At a final hearing, a large number of possible, factual outcomes will be available.

  3 Of course, the matters on which the Suzlon companies rely are currently merely in the form of untested allegations before me, but I must proceed on the basis of them in order to assess whether inferences can be drawn which would establish a prima facie case, as explained in Beluga (No 2) [2008] FCA 1770 at [32] . 2 In Beluga Shipping GmbH &amp; Co &amp; Headway Shipping Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1770 , I dealt with the Suzlon companies' earlier application to serve the proceedings outside the jurisdiction on their former employee, Mr Bangad, in India. Subsequently, the Suzlon companies have become aware of the existence and activities of two companies which appear to have close links to Mr Bangad, namely Genus Shipping Services Pvt Limited, a company incorporated in India, and SS Oceanwind Pte Limited, a company incorporated in Singapore. The Suzlon companies seek orders joining the latter companies and permitting service on them out of the jurisdiction. 21 I am satisfied for the purposes of O 8 r 2, item 18, that SS Oceanwind and Genus Shipping are proper and necessary parties in the scheme of the alleged frauds by Mr Bangad, which are already the subject matter of the proceedings: see Beluga (No 2) [2008] FCA 1770 at [38] . The claims arise out of or relate to an agreement for the carriage of goods by ship or the use or hire of ships within the meaning of s 4(3)(f) of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth). I am also satisfied for the reasons that I gave in Beluga (No 2) [2008] FCA 1770 at [12] - [13] that the proceedings against SS Oceanwind and Genus Shipping are concerned with the resolution of controversies relating to marine commerce and navigation and are within the Court's admiralty and maritime jurisdiction either directly, under s 4(3)(f) , or in the associated jurisdiction conferred by s 12 of the Act. 21 I am satisfied for the purposes of O 8 r 2, item 18, that SS Oceanwind and Genus Shipping are proper and necessary parties in the scheme of the alleged frauds by Mr Bangad, which are already the subject matter of the proceedings: see Beluga (No 2) [2008] FCA 1770 at [38] .
