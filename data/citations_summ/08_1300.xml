<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 2017">In the circumstances where an administrator has been appointed to a company, s440A(2) of the Act requires the Court to adjourn the winding-up application filed by GRD if it is satisfied that it is in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration as an alternative to proceeding with the winding-up. Mr McConnel appeared for Mr Duncan and Mr Powell. He submitted that, taking into account the short period of time that the administrators have been in office, there is sufficient evidence to satisfy the Court that the winding-up application should be adjourned for a short period of time in order to allow the administrators to continue to investigate the company's affairs. Mr McConnel has proposed the winding-up application be listed again before the expiry of the 20 day period, during which time the administrators are required to hold the second meeting of creditors pursuant to s439A of the Act, which Mr McConnel has informed me is due to be held on 30 October 2008. Mr McConnel has submitted that this course was taken by Greenwood J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Q Bridge Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1300 (' Q Bridge' ). In Q Bridge , Greenwood J was satisfied that a short adjournment of eight working days was in the interests of the creditors of Q Bridge , where that company was trading and there was some evidence to suggest that allowing the administration to continue would provide a better outcome to the creditors than proceeding with the winding-up. Greenwood J also took into account (at [22]) the following factors: 
 In this particular case, there is no persuasive conduct on the part of the officers of the company which would suggest that there has been insolvent trading, although, of course, there simply is no evidence of any of these conduct questions, because the voluntary administrators have not had sufficient time to examine the various matters.
