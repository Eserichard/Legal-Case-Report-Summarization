<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 30">The same level of analysis demonstrates why the decision in Lennon v State of South Australia [2010] FCA 743 ( Lennon ) also does not assist the appellants. In Lennon Mansfield J decided that, if one of the persons named on the Register as the applicant dies, the other persons constituting the applicant (as defined in s 61(2) of the Native Title Act ) continue to be authorised and can act as the applicant. His Honour further decided that the Court was able to remove the name of the deceased person from the Register without the need for an application under s 66B. In so deciding it is true that Mansfield J said that, to the extent necessary to support his conclusion, he disagreed with the decision of Siopis J in Sambo v State of Western Australia [2008] FCA 1575 ; (2008) 172 FCR 271 ( Sambo ). In Sambo Siopis J (at [30]) held that "there is only one means whereby any changes can be made to the composition of the applicant and that is through s 66B of the [Native Title] Act". Leaving aside the distinction between an application to remove an applicant who has died (with which Mansfield J was dealing in Lennon ) and one to remove two living persons and retain the five remaining persons as the applicant (with which Siopis J was dealing in Sambo ), neither was confronted by the same issue as that which arises in the present case. Mansfield J did not, for example, suggest that the deceased applicant in Lennon ceased to be an applicant (and thus a registered native title claimant) immediately upon death. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 102">As Siopis J correctly observed in Sambo v Western Australia [2008] FCA 1575 ; (2008) 172 FCR 271 at [25] - [29] the 2007 amendments are inconsistent with the premise that underlies, amongst others, the decision in Doolan . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1019">This approach is similar to that taken to the construction of the definition of the expression " applicant " in Butchulla People at [42] to [43]; Doolan at [56] to [59]; and Lennon at [34]. For completeness, I should add two things. First, I note a different conclusion was reached in Sambo v Western Australia (2008) 172 FCR 271 ; [2008] FCA 1575. If it were necessary to do so, it follows from the view I have expressed above that I would be forced to respectfully disagree with that decision, as Mansfield J did in Lennon : at [32]. Secondly, I do not consider the recent decision in Tigan v Western Australia [2010] FCA 993 affects my conclusion about the construction of the definition of the expression " applicant " because, in that case, Gilmour J distinguished the first two of these decisions above on their facts (at [27]) and the factual situation he was dealing with --- a claim group directing a notice of change of solicitor be filed contrary to the wishes of some of the members of the authorised applicant --- is itself distinguishable from the factual situation I have outlined above. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 743">In Sambo and Others v Western Australia and Others [2008] FCA 1575 ; [2008] 172 FCR 271 the Court was confronted with an applicant, comprising seven authorised persons, who were apparently unable collectively to make decisions as to the progress of the claim. Five of the authorised persons applied to have the remaining two of them removed as parties because (it was said) they had failed to respond to the legal representatives engaged on behalf of the applicant to provide instructions or had failed to provide evidence on matters relating to connection. There had been no meeting of the native title claim group to address those difficulties among the authorised persons, by reason of the expense, the delay, and the lack of resources to do so. The Court decided that s 66B of the NT Act provided the only means to permit any changes to be made to the composition of the applicant. It ruled that O 6 r 9 of the Federal Court Rules was not an available recourse to do so. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] NNTTA 54">Whether that principle of law should be followed subsequent to the 2007 amendments to the Act (see Sambo v Western Australia [2008] FCA 1575) , is not necessary to consider for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] NNTTA 171">One recent example of such an approach is Leedham Papertalk &amp; Ors on behalf of the Mullewa Wadjari Community/Western Australia/Aurox Resources Ltd, [2009] NNTTA 159 (30 November 2009) (" Leedham Papertalk") . It is also the case that in a number of decisions, the Federal Court has looked beyond the persons comprising the Applicant to ascertain what are the wishes and aspirations of the claim group, and has held that unanimity is not necessarily a pre-requisite for action by the Applicant: see Butchulla People v Queensland [2006] FCA 1063 ; (2006) 154 FCR 233 and Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192 ; (2007) 158 FCR 56. Whether that principle of law should be followed subsequent to the 2007 amendments to the Act (see Sambo v Western Australia [2008] FCA 1575) , is not necessary to consider for present purposes. What is clear is that it is appropriate, in particular circumstances, for the Tribunal to look beyond the persons comprising the Applicant to ascertain what are the wishes of the broader claim group when determining whether the make a consent determination. [20] I am of the view that it is open to the Tribunal to make a consent determination even if, as is the case in this matter, a majority of the persons collectively comprising the Applicant, have neither executed the Ancillary Agreement or State Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 533">56 Counsel for the applicant movers referred me to my decision in Sambo v State of Western Australia [2008] FCA 1575 ; (2008) 172 FCR 271 ( Sambo ), where I held that s 66B of the Act was the only process by which an applicant in a native title determination may be replaced.</sentence>
