<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 30">Such a statutory lien used to exist in this State (by virtue of s.104 of the Legal Profession Practice Act 1958 ) but has not existed since the passage of the Legal Practice Act 1996. (citations omitted) 
 
 
 249 The important aspect of the solicitor's lien is that it is over a fund that represents the fruits of the labour of the solicitor. In ASIC v GDK Financial Solutions (No 3) [133] Finkelstein J said that the a receiver is entitled to be paid out of the proceeds of sale of mortgage property the costs of any work that directly benefits the mortgagee. [134] He said: 
 
 
 There are, of course, several circumstances in which a receiver's costs will stand ahead of the claims of a secured creditor. First of all, a receiver is entitled to be paid out of the proceeds of sale of mortgaged property the cost of any work that directly benefits the mortgagee. I see no material distinction in preserving and caring for property before it is realised and expenditure incurred in preserving and caring for the property after it has been realised. The expenditure is still being incurred for the benefit of the fund. As Finkelstein said in ASIC v GDK Financial Solutions (No 3) [147] the expenditure directly benefits the security holders over that fund. 271 Accordingly, in my view the costs expenses and reasonable remuneration of liquidator in pursuing the proceedings against MIG and Mr Vartelas and in defending the claims of MIG and Mr Vartelas constitute an equitable Universal lien over the fund in court and the funds recovered by the proceedings. This lien will have priority over the lien of the trustee and the equitable proprietary interests of Mr Malhotra, Mr Velos and Mr Tiwari.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] WASC 318">148 As to the second submission, that order 8 should rather be read as providing for the party who had obtained the receivership orders, CAT, to be secondarily liable for the receiver's costs, I do not doubt that CJE Act s 87(5) is sufficient to authorise a court to make such an order. See on the power of a court, in the absence of such a statutory power and following final judgment, so to order Re Andrews at 1243 and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 3) [2008] FCA 448 ; (2008) 246 ALR 580 [18] (Finkelstein J). However, in my view it is not possible to extract such an apportionment of responsibility from 'primarily payable' in order 8, and no authority was cited to me to a contrary effect. It appears to me rather that 'primarily payable' should be read as allowing for the receiver's lien to be the security for payment, that is, the secondary source.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] WASC 138">In Re Arrowfield Group Ltd (1995) 17 ACSR 649 an objector was awarded his costs of objecting to a reduction of capital even though he was unsuccessful in his objections. 8 The cases referred to by the Applicants also include cases in which a fund that belongs to a secured creditor may be charged with another person's costs. In ASIC v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 3) [2008] FCA 448 ; (2008) 246 ALR 580 Finkelstein J observed that it is a long-settled rule that the costs incurred for the benefit of all persons having an interest in an asset (usually a fund that is subject to various claims) must be borne by the fund. The rule was confirmed and discussed by the Court of Appeal in Coad v Wellness Pursuit Pty Ltd [2009] WASCA 68 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 250. 9 In Re NRMA Ltd [2000] NSWSC 82 ; (2000) 33 ACSR 595 Santow J considered an application for orders convening scheme meetings and to approve an explanatory statement for a proposed scheme of arrangement pursuant to s 411 of the Corporations Law. That risk is accentuated by the introduction of an arbitrary time period commencing on 12 May 2010. Paragraph 8(e) of the Minute will be deleted from the orders made.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 512">In the second set of reasons for judgment to which Mr Vaughan referred, that being those in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 4) [2008] FCA 858 ; (2008) 169 FCR 497 , which were published on 12 June 2008, his Honour said, at 499 [3]; 
 'The Mews land, which was registered in the name of WRVM, was the only substantial asset of the scheme, no village ever having been constructed. The receivers took possession of the land and found a purchaser to whom, with court approval, WRVM sold the land. As AVS and Rental Fleets refused to discharge their mortgage, it was necessary to make an order to that effect so that the sale could be completed. The order was made on the application of Messrs McMaster and Mentha: Australian Securities and Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 3) [2008] FCA 448 ; (2008) 246 ALR 580. The receivers were also ordered to hold the net proceeds of sale pending the resolution of all claims on those proceeds. 
 
  The passages in the earlier judgments to which Mr Vaughan referred, occur, first, in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 3) [2008] FCA 448 ; (2008) 246 ALR 580 , a judgment delivered 4 April 2008. In the course of those reasons, his Honour said at 581 [3]; 
 '... As regards the second mortgagees [including AVS], they had refused to discharge their mortgage unless one of the mortgagees, AVS, was paid the balance of the proceeds of sale, which happens to be less than the amount which it claims is secured by the second mortgage. The quantum of its claim is contested. '

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] WASCA 68">66 Recently, in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 3) [2008] FCA 448 ; (2008) 246 ALR 580 , Finkelstein J stated and analysed the rule that costs incurred for the benefit of all persons having an interest in a fund must be borne by the fund. Receivers had been appointed by the court to supervise the winding up of an unregistered managed investment scheme. The assets of the scheme included a parcel of land in Western Australia. The land, which was encumbered by two mortgages, was sold by the receivers. A dispute arose as to the claims of the receivers to the proceeds of sale. The first mortgagee was ordered to discharge its mortgage in exchange for payment of the amount due to it. The second mortgagees were ordered to discharge their mortgage on the basis that the net balance of the purchase price would be paid into court. When these orders were made, the second mortgagees sought to stay orders to the effect that the receivers could appropriate their costs out of the proceeds of sale. The stay application was dismissed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1700">The balance (after deducting the costs and expenses of sale) was about $13 million. This was less than the amount claimed by AVS to be secured by the second mortgage: it claimed it was owed in excess of $14 million. In those circumstances it was ordered that the balance be paid into an interest bearing account in the name of the receivers pending the determination of what was due to AVS: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 3) [2008] FCA 448 ; (2008) 246 ALR 580 . On the taking of accounts it was established that the principal due to AVS was $4,100,282.64 and that interest calculated to 17 March 2008 (the day the money was paid into the receivers' account) was $1,573,613.32: Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 4) [2008] FCA 1071 . Those amounts were paid to AVS on 22 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1071">107 Finkelstein J considered and rejected the AVS profit share claim in his reasons for judgment in ASIC v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 3) [2008] FCA 448 at [27] - [31]. Although the claim at that time was merely foreshadowed rather than actual, it turns out the actual claim is on precisely the same basis and in precisely the same terms as the foreshadowed claim rejected by Finkelstein J. While it is true that his Honour's comments on the profit share issue are non-binding dicta, I nevertheless consider them to be clearly correct and adopt them. Although I do not propose to repeat all of his Honour's reasons here, a simple restatement of the fundamental premise is that, in the absence of any definition of "profit" in the agreement, there is no reasonable, or even rational, implied definition or formula for profit under which it could be said that a profit was made. </sentence>
