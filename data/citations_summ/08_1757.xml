<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 853">Orders under s.665(1)(d) were made against two corporate respondents and an individual respondent. There was no discussion of the basis on which an order could be made against an individual under s.665(1)(d), except that Nicholls FM accepted the individual respondent in that case operated the business in question. However, as I raised with counsel for the applicant, the respondents in Barhoum filed an unsuccessful application for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal in the Federal Court ( All Districts Coating Pty Ltd v Barhoum [2008] FCA 1757). In the course of his judgment Moore J noted that while orders had been made against two corporate respondents and an individual respondent, the Federal Magistrate had made no express finding as to the identity of the employer of Mr Barhoum. Relevantly his Honour noted at [19] that: Counsel for the respondent conceded, correctly, that it is at least arguable that in proceedings brought against an employer under s 663, the power to make orders conferred by s 665 is limited to making orders against the employer, even though the power to make any other order that the Court thinks necessary, provided for in s 665(1)(d), is not expressly limited to an order against the employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 46">the explanation for the delay. This application for an extension of time was described by both parties as the second application. This description arises from the fact that there was an earlier decision of Moore J, being All Districts Coating Pty Ltd v Barhoum (2008) FCA 1757 (24 November 2008), in which his Honour dismissed an application for an extension of time. The parties agreed the relevant principles in relation to such a second application. Those principles are accurately summarised at [28] to [33] of the respondent's written submissions, referring to the decisions in Walton v Gardner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1992) 177 CLR 378 at 393, Clairs Keeley (a firm ) v Treacy [2004] WASCA 277 ; (2004) 29 WAR 479 at [7] to [14], Wentworth v Rogers (unreported, Sup Ct, NSW, Sperling J, SC 19228 of 1982, 28 April 1995), Nominal Defendant v Manning [2000] NSWCA 80 ; (2000) 50 NSWLR 139 at 156 and National Parks and Wildlife Service v Pierson (2002) 55 NSWLR 315.</sentence>
