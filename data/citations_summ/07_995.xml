<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1016">A question arises whether, in considering s 25(2B)(aa), it is necessary for the Court to also have recourse to s 31A. In a number of cases the Court has exercised power pursuant to s 25(2B)(aa) and given summary judgment without reference to s 31A: Druett v Department of Families, Community Services &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 995 , Zambini v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1773 , Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 1326 , Rana v University of Adelaide (No 2) [2008] FCA 941. However in other cases the Court has linked the power under s 25(2B)(aa) to the jurisdiction of the Court under s 31A and summarily dismissed an appeal on the basis that the appellant had no reasonable prospect of success in prosecuting its grounds of appeal: Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 923 , Bishop v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1118.  Such further or other adjournments, enquiries, directions and other orders as to this Honourable Court seem appropriate. Issue 1 --- what is the nature of the Court's jurisdiction to strike out a notice of appeal pursuant to section 25(2B)(aa) of the Federal Court Act
 Section 25(2B)(aa) provides that a single judge or the Full Court may give summary judgment in an appellate matter. That a single judge may give judgment summarily dismissing an appeal from a decision of the Court is clear from decisions applying the section: Druett v Department of Families, Community Services &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 995 , Bishop v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1118. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 898">I handed down my decision regarding the Department's notice of motion on 3 July 2007: Druett v Department of Families, Community Services &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 995. After considering Mr Druett's notice of appeal, the parties' submissions and the decisions of the Tribunal and the primary judge, I could see no error of law on the part of the Tribunal or on the part of the primary judge. I concluded that there was no ground of appeal which might be arguable and that the appeal should be summarily dismissed. I also concluded that there was no basis upon which the Department was properly a party to the proceedings and that the Department was entitled to be removed as a party.  The Department now presses for an order that it be removed as a party to the proceedings on the basis that it was not a party to the proceedings before the Tribunal. In view of my conclusion in Druett v Department of Families, Community Services &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 995 that the Department was entitled to be removed as a party to the proceedings, that order should be made. I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett. Associate:
 
 
Dated: 17 August 2009
 
 The Appellant appeared in person. Solicitor for the First Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor 
 Date of Hearing: 11 August 2009 
 
 Date of Judgment: 11 August 2009
