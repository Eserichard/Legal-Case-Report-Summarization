<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 61">4 There is a substantial body of authority in the Federal Court and other Australian Courts that the Court has no power to extend the time for compliance after it has expired: Aussie Vic Plant Hire Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd [2007] VSCA 121 ; (2007) 63 ACSR 300 and G&amp;J Gears Australia Pty Ltd v Brobo Group Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 330 ; (2006) 229 ALR 638 at [46] to [52] and the authorities referred to therein. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] VSCA 121">28 As already noted, the power to extend the time for compliance conferred by paragraph (a)(i) is exercisable by the court-- 
 
 
 "...on hearing the [company's] application under section 459G , or on an application by the company under this paragraph ..." 
 
 
 As first pointed out by Jenkinson J in Livestock Traders , and accepted ever since, the phrase "the period specified... in the last such order" in paragraph (a)(i) shows that the power to extend time is exercisable from time to time as occasion requires. [34] The High Court in David Grant noted that an extension effected by an order under paragraph (a)(i) "may itself be extended on further application". [35] Nor is there any doubt that the power is available to a court exercising an appellate function. [36]  24 Here, as noted earlier, the Master did exercise the power conferred by paragraph (a)(i) to extend the time for compliance with the demand. Plainly enough, once an order has been made under paragraph (a)(i), the determination of when the time for compliance expires is governed exclusively by paragraph (a)(i). Paragraph (a)(ii) has no application at all. That the paragraphs are mutually exclusive is clear from the use of the word "otherwise" at the commencement of paragraph (a)(ii). This has been accepted since the decision of Jenkinson J in Livestock Traders International Pty Ltd v BUI (" Livestock Traders "). [33]  71 In G &amp; J Gears , Kenny J did deal with the present question. There was an application before her Honour under s 459G to set aside a statutory demand. This was a rehearing of an application to the Registrar of the Court (equivalent to a Master in this Court). The company had also made application for an extension of the time for compliance. Her Honour dismissed the application to extend time, holding that --- 
 
 
 "The Court has no power to extend the time for compliance with the statutory demand because the time for compliance has expired. G &amp; J Gears is deemed to be insolvent because it has failed to comply with the demand within the time required, as extended by the registrar. A review of the registrar's decision is therefore nugatory. " [94]  [128] French, Kiefel and Sundberg JJ. [129] Equuscorp , 701. Although their Honours did not say this in terms, given their reference to the cases which they cited in support of the conclusion that "[p]rovided an application for an extension is brought before the expiry of the period fixed for compliance, that period can be further extended even if the s 459G application has been determined", including Livestock and Graywinter , I think it is plain enough that, as Kenny J recognised in G &amp; J Gears Australia Pty Ltd v Brobo Group Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 330 (" Gears "), [49]-[51], their Honours meant that no such extension could be granted after the period in question has expired. [130] Gears , [49]-[52]. [131] Sub-s 7 was an original provision of the Act ; sub-s (6A) was inserted by the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1980 . 62 But the submission is seriously inaccurate. A review of the authorities cited reveals that there are only four decisions --- all of single judges --- in which the question in issue on this appeal has been considered on its merits. The first two are the decisions to which we have already referred, of Jenkinson J in Livestock Traders and of Ryan J in Graywinter Properties . The other two --- of Hansen J in Burwood Retail Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (" Burwood Retail ") [71] and of Kenny J in G &amp; J Gears Australia Pty Ltd v Brobo Group Pty Ltd (" G &amp; J Gears ") [72] --- are, essentially, applications of the earlier two decisions.</sentence>
