<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1066">The position identified by Jessel MR was accepted as correct in relation to disclaimers by liquidators and trustees in bankruptcy in a series of Australian cases decided prior to the enactment of ss 13H and 13J of the RP Act , and collected by Bowen CJ in Eq in Re Middle Harbour Investments Ltd and the Companies Act [1977] 2 NSWLR 652 at 662A-G, see too at 662G-664G; and Needham J in Re Tulloch Ltd 3 ACLR at 812-813 (followed by Madgwick J in In the Matter of Woo; National Australia Bank v Leroy [2003] FCA 862 at [10] ); see too the discussions by Napier CJ in Ex parte Cleland &amp; Teesdale Smith [1960] SASR 199 at 209, Bryson J in Sandhurst Trustees Ltd v 72 Seventh Street Nominees Pty Ltd (in liq) (1998) 45 NSWLR 556 at 563B-566A (who did discuss ss 13H and 13J) and by EM Heenan J in Rams Mortgage Corporation Ltd v Skipworth (No 2) [2007] WASC 75 ; (2007) 239 ALR 799 at 800-802 [6] - [11]. In Re Condobolin Bila CDEP Ltd (deregistered); Commonwealth v New South Wales [2006] FCA 1330 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 682 , Gyles J held that where land had been purchased by a company using grant moneys from a Commonwealth body that later was wound up and the liquidator disclaimed the land, it should be ordered pursuant to s 568F of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to vest in the Commonwealth, the State having submitted to any order the Court might make. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] WASC 75">8 In these instances of statutory disclaimer, it is accepted that disclaimed land escheats to the Crown: Re Mercer and Moore (1880) 14 Ch D 287 , per Jessel MR at 295 - 296; Re Levy (1881) 17 Ch D 746 , per Jessel MR at 753; Attorney-General (Ontario) v Mercer ( supra ) per Selborne LC at 772; Re Middle Harbour Investments Ltd (In Liq) [1977] 2 NSWLR 652 per Bowen CJ in Eq at 662; Re Tulloch Ltd (In Liq) (1978) 3 ACLR 808 per Needham J at 812 - 813; Re Weiland (Dec) (1945) 13 ABC 220 per Clyne J at 225; cf. Re Lasscock (1961) 18 ABC 263 per Paine J at 271. This overlooks the possibility of land reverting to a mesne lord if it were held of a mesne lord: Williams T C, "The Fundamental Principles of the Present Law of Ownership of Land" (1931) 75 The Solicitors' Journal 843 at 846; however, since the process of subinfeudation was abolished prior to settlement, this apparent oversight is of no consequence in any of the Australian States or Territories: Re Middle Harbour Investments Ltd (In Liq) ( supra ) per Bowen CJ in Eq at 662. In Australia, disclaimed land will escheat to the Crown in right of the State which originally granted the land. For this reason, in both Sandhurst Trustees Ltd v 72 Seventh Street Nominees Pty Ltd (In Liq) (1998) 45 NSWLR 556 at 561 and Re Condobolin Bila CDEP Ltd (deregistered) [2006] FCA 1330 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 682 at 684, the State of New South Wales was made a party to the actions on the basis that it had an interest in the land upon escheat. Such an escheat occurs automatically upon the occurrence of the event which causes it (for example, the disclaimer). Thus an order for escheat made under s 7 of the Escheat (Procedure) Act 1940 (WA) is declaratory in effect, and confirms rather than brings about the particular escheat.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] WASC 24">82 Upon the notice of disclaimer being given by the trustee of Mr Skipworth's interest in the land all his right, title and interest in the land terminated (without affecting the mortgagee's interest). Mrs Skipworth remains as the owner of a one undivided half share as tenant in common but, in the absence of a vesting order made under s 133(9) of the Bankruptcy Act , Mr Skipworth's interest will revert or escheat to the Crown: Re Mercer &amp; Moore (1880) 14 Ch D 287 and Re Tulloch Ltd (1978) 3 ACLR 808 per Needham J SCNSW. No submissions were made about such a reversion or escheat. The authorities suggest that such a reversion or escheat would be to the Crown in the right of the State rather than the Commonwealth and this would appear to be consistent with the original sovereignty of the State over all land within its boundaries not specifically acquired by the Commonwealth: see Commonwealth v New South Wales [2006] FCA 1330 and Re Woo; National Australia Bank v Leroy [2003] FCA 862 at [5] .</sentence>
