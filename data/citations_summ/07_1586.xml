<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] AATA 761">The respondent relies on the decision in Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission v Perry (2007) FCA 1586 where it was held by Bennett J in the Federal Court that s 8(9B) was applicable to employees whose injuries arose prior to the date of commencement of the Amending Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1862">4 The reasons for judgment addressed both issues ( Military Rehabilitation &amp; Compensation Commission v Perry [2007] FCA 1586). The applicant ('the Commission') was successful on the retrospectivity issue but unsuccessful on the construction issue (at [59]-[60]). It was therefore unsuccessful in its challenge to the decision under review in the Tribunal. Accordingly, the application was dismissed (at [61]).
