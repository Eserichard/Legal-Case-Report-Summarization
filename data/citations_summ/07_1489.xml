<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 547">In Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 (" Seven Network "), Sackville J (at [50]---[62]) referred to the differing statements in Black v Lipovac and Dukemaster and declined to adopt the formulation of "plainly" unreasonable, preferring "imprudent or unreasonable" as an appropriate reconciliation of the two judgments. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 450">It has been recognised that there is no presumption that the rejection of an offer, followed by a more favourable result to the offeror, automatically leads to an indemnity costs order against an offeree being made: see Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 per Sundberg, Emmett and Conti JJ at [7]. This is but one factor to be considered: see Seven Network Ltd and Anor v News Ltd and Ors [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [66] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 323">M2006 claims that it is entitled to indemnity costs from the date upon which it made an offer of compromise. That offer was made on 12 June 2008 and was rejected. Both parties accept that in claiming indemnity costs a party must show that the rejection of the offer of compromise was "imprudent or unreasonable": Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1805 at [23] and the cases cited therein. As Kenny J said in that decision at [24]: 
 
 The question is, therefore, whether or not it can be said that the applicants acted imprudently or unreasonably in rejecting Redberry's offer of compromise in relation to the applicants' claim. Plainly enough, even in the present circumstances, the mere refusal of an offer of compromise is not sufficient to satisfy this test: see John S Hayes &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 201 at 206 per Hill J and Dukemaster [2003] FCAFC 1 at [7] . Although the refusal of the offer is a factor to take into account, it is not determinative on the question of indemnity costs. As Sackville J said in Seven Network [2007] FCA [2007] FCA 1489 ; 1489 ; 244 ALR 374 at [65] , "the court is required to consider whether the rejection of the offer of compromise was unreasonable by considering, among any other relevant circumstances, the strengths and weaknesses of the applicants' case, looking at the claim prospectively at the time the offer was made" (emphasis original). 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FCA 283">The fact that an applicant is unsuccessful in the litigation is a factor to be taken into account when assessing the reasonableness of the applicant's rejection of the offer: see Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [65] per Sackville J. In the present circumstances, where the applicant was relevantly on notice at all material times of the key factual and legal matters upon which it would lose its case, at least by the close of most of the evidence in October 2009, the applicant acted imprudently and unreasonably in refusing, and continuing to refuse, the respondent's offers of compromise. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1068"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 381">As I have already noted, Granitgard submitted that the second offer was not to be regarded as an offer for the purposes of O 23 r 11(6) because it was not a "genuine" offer but rather just a procedural move to trigger costs consequences. Reference was made to an apprehension which Finkelstein J had voiced in Brookfield Multiplex (No 4) (at [7]) as to there being two lines of authority in respect of whether the sub-rule gave rise to a "presumptive entitlement" to indemnity costs in the event of a more favourable outcome for a respondent at trial. Very properly, it was pointed out on behalf of Granitgard and the fact is that the two authorities cited by his Honour as tending against a "presumptive entitlement" approach, Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [65] - [66] and Coshott v Learoyd [1999] FCA 276 were each decided prior to the amendment to the rules which inserted O 23 r 11(6). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCAFC 31">(2) The broad discretionary power in respect of costs conferred by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) cannot be confined by treating O 23 r 11(6) as creating a presumption able to be rebutted only in an exceptional case (cf Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 281 ; [2004] FCA 1437 at [17] ). Such an interpretation would fetter the scope of the discretion impermissibly and contrary to the recent statement of principle in Howards Storage World Pty Ltd v Haviv Holdings Pty Ltd [2010] FCAFC 5. (3) The appellants failure to accept the offer must be considered by reference to the period of the offer between 22 September and 6 October 2009 and not with the findings in our principal judgment delivered on 10 March 2010 in mind ( Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (2007) 244 ALR 374 ; [2007] FCA 1489 at [65] ). (4) In determining the application for leave Jacobson J made observations supportive of the appellants' appeal. The grant of leave shows that the appellants achieved the "formidable task" ( Lenijamar Pty Ltd v AGC (Advances) Limited [1990] FCA 520 ; (1990) 27 FCR 388 at 393) of persuading Jacobson J that the primary judge's costs order was attended by sufficient doubt and error of principle as to warrant reconsideration by a Full Court so as to avoid substantial injustice ( D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 398-399).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 304">In the present case, the parties' disagreement as to costs centred on the application of O 23 r 11(6) of the Rules, which commenced operation on 2 August 2008. Rule 11(6) applies in the circumstances described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of that rule, including where an applicant fails altogether to obtain relief after a respondent has made an offer of compromise. Previous statements to the effect that O 23 r 11 did not cover such a circumstance pre-date the introduction of rule 11(6): see, e.g., McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 at 597 and Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at 381. </sentence>

 THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 

 
 1. The appeal be dismissed. 2. 1078 The Seven and C7 (the cross-respondents) case at trial failed against all of the respondents who remained respondents to the proceeding when the trial Judge delivered his reasons. There was every reason to think costs should follow the event. Optus's cross-claim also failed but nothing now turns on that. His Honour adopted the course of delivering reasons and inviting the parties to bring in short minutes. He noted that the issue of costs loomed large and he provided a timetable for the filing of any evidence and submissions on the question of costs. In due course, five parties or groups of parties made written submissions on the question of costs. His Honour noted those submissions at J [11] of his costs judgment: Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1489: </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCA 803">Second, there is the non-literal approach namely that "the fact that the unsuccessful applicant rejected an offer of compromise made by a respondent pursuant to O 23 is far from determinative on the question of indemnity costs" and that the court "is required to consider whether the rejection of the offer of compromise was unreasonable": Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [65] --- [66]. In other words, there is no presumption so far as what costs order should be made and the fact that an O 23 offer is not bettered is but one factor to be taken into account in determining whether indemnity costs should be awarded. Indeed, it is no more than a "good start": Seven Network Ltd at [66] citing Wilcox J in Coshott v Learoyd [1999] FCA 276. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] WASCA 115">
 
26 More recently, in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 , Sackville J said that the policy reasons given in Black for avoiding the word 'plainly' were persuasive [62], and in University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 ; (2008) 249 ALR 360 , French J observed:
 
 On the question of the level of unreasonableness necessary to attract the discretion, I respectfully agree with the comment of Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (2007) 244 ALR 374 ; [2007] FCA 1489 at [62] questioning the utility of substituting a requirement that rejection be 'plainly unreasonable' for the requirement that it be 'unreasonable'. Given the evaluative character of the judgment involved the addition of the word 'plainly' which is itself evaluative, has no useful function [36]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCA 571">The time by which Olivaylle had to file its evidence in chief according to the then current interlocutory timetable lapsed during the time when the offer was open for acceptance. The critique offered by Flottweg by reference to various conclusions reached at trial does not, in my opinion, impermissibly call in aid a false wisdom of hindsight. I accept that I must consider whether the rejection of the offer was unreasonable by considering, inter alia, the strengths and weaknesses of Olivaylle's case prospectively at the time when the offer was made: Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [65] and the authorities there cited by Sackville J. Rather, what the critique does is to highlight evidentiary difficulties that were present in Olivaylle's case during the time originally fixed for the filing of its evidence in chief. As events transpired, those difficulties remained thereafter but what is presently relevant about the subjects identified in the critique is that, on the bases highlighted and viewed prospectively , Olivaylle either knew or ought reasonably to have known when the offer was made that it just could not hope to receive anything remotely approaching a damages award of some $27 million, as propounded on the strength of Mr Jorgensen's first report. Its evidentiary difficulties persisted, as was candidly acknowledged on the adjournment application, but in essential elements were present in August 2007. It is true that the evidentiary foundation of the cases for each party was embellished during the trial but that does not detract from the significance of the evidentiary difficulties present in August 2007.  I am bound to follow matters of principle enunciated by the Full Court. In that regard, it may be, as Buchanan J highlights in the following passage from his judgment in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 at 597, [22] , that there is a difference in opinion at intermediate appellate level as to whether, for the purpose of satisfying a condition precedent to the awarding of indemnity costs and as an alternative to "imprudent", the rejection of an offer of compromise should be able to be described as "unreasonable" or "plainly unreasonable": In Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 ( Dukemaster) Sundberg and Emmett JJ said, in a case like the present where O 23 r 11 did not apply because an applicant had been wholly unsuccessful, that an applicant for a more generous award of costs than party-party costs 'must show that the rejection of the offer was imprudent or plainly unreasonable' (see at [7]). There has been doubt expressed about the soundness of the statement in Dukemaster that rejection of an offer, if unreasonable, must be 'plainly unreasonable' in the light of the earlier judgment of a Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] --- [218], to which Wilcox J also referred in Coshott (see Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1489 at [59] --- [62]). 
In the earlier of the Full Court authorities, Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at 432-433, [218] , the point was made that the conduct of an offeree need not be "plainly unreasonable" in order to warrant the ordering of indemnity costs because "To adopt an especially high standard of unreasonableness would operate as a fetter on the discretion to award indemnity costs and diminish the effectiveness of the Calderbank offer as an incentive to settlement. " I respectfully agree and, for that reason, would choose to follow the earlier Full Court authority were that to be critical to the resolution of the costs application. It is not though because in both Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 and Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 the alternative of imprudent rejection was acknowledged. Like Buchanan J in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) and, as his Honour noted (at [22]), like Heerey J in AFP Properties Pty Ltd v Kestrel Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2016 at [24] --- [25], it is sufficient to assess whether the rejection of any of the offers was, "imprudent". That basis of assessment accords with the exemplar given by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited , which I have already noted, whose judgment, as Heerey J acknowledged in AFP Properties (ibid), is the locus classicus on the subject.  Flottweg's submissions did not gainsay the matters of principle for which the cases relied upon by Olivaylle stood, only the application of those principles in the circumstances of this particular case. In particular, Flottweg accepted that the mere fact that the result at trial left Olivaylle worse off than any pre-trial offer carried with it no presumptive entitlement to an award of indemnity costs. Rather, it was submitted that the question was whether the rejection of the offers (or at least one of them) was unreasonable or imprudent, the discussion and conclusions reached by Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [59] to [63] with respect to Black v Lipovac , supra and other authorities being adopted. Flottweg further submitted that, while it may not have been unreasonable or imprudent for Olivaylle to have instituted or, as the case may be, continued the litigation in the absence of one or more of the offers it made, at least one of those offers constituted a fair commercial compromise such that it was unreasonable or imprudent to institute or continue the litigation in the face of that offer. That sentiment, it was submitted, was evident in the approach taken by Emmett J in Ruaro v Ferrari [2008] FCA 307 at [17] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCAFC 40">7 In reliance on rule 11(6) the respondents submitted that there were no relevant matters which would lead the Court to make an order "contrary to the presumption" in the rule. In answer the appellant contended that rule 11(5) does not apply to an applicant/appellant who has been wholly unsuccessful, relying on McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 and Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489. On that basis the appellant asserted that an award of indemnity costs could not be made unless the respondents demonstrated that its refusal of the offer was "imprudent or unreasonable": Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 at [6] . It is clear therefore that the parties did not at that stage join issue on the applicable rule, namely rule 11(6). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FCAFC 36">78 In his judgment on costs ([2008] FCA 1526) the primary judge referred to many of the cases dealing with the situations in which indemnity costs may be awarded. The applicable principles were not in dispute. See, for example, Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 and Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [59] - [62].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FCA 1805">24 The question is, therefore, whether or not it can be said that the applicants acted imprudently or unreasonably in rejecting Redberry's offer of compromise in relation to the applicants' claim. Plainly enough, even in the present circumstances, the mere refusal of an offer of compromise is not sufficient to satisfy this test: see John S Hayes &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 201 at 206 per Hill J and Dukemaster [2003] FCAFC 1 at [7] . Although the refusal of the offer is a factor to take into account, it is not determinative on the question of indemnity costs. As Sackville J said in Seven Network [2007] FCA 1489 ; 244 ALR 374 at [65] , "the court is required to consider whether the rejection of the offer of compromise was unreasonable by considering, among any other relevant circumstances, the strengths and weaknesses of the applicants' case, looking at the claim prospectively at the time the offer was made" (emphasis original).  23 The authorities recognise that the making of an offer outside O 23 by a respondent, which is rejected by an applicant who turns out to be wholly unsuccessful, is a matter to be taken into account in determining the nature of the costs order to be made. In such a case, a respondent claiming indemnity costs must show that the rejection of the offer of compromise was imprudent or unreasonable: see Dukemaster [2003] FCAFC 1 at [7] ; University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 at [36] per French J; and Seven Network [2007] FCA 1489 ; 244 ALR 374 at [39] and [51]. Where a cross-claimant makes an offer, which is rejected by a cross-respondent, and the cross-claimant ultimately fails, the position is quite different since there is little, if any, basis for saying that the rejection of the offer of compromise was imprudent and unreasonable.  21 As at August 2007, the only provision in connection with costs following an applicant's rejection of a respondent's offer of compromise was O 23 r 11(5), which deals with the position "[i]f ... an offer is made by a respondent and not accepted by the applicant; and ... the applicant obtains judgment on the claim to which the offer relates not more favourable than the terms of the offer". If applicable, this provision also creates a presumptive entitlement in the respondent to indemnity costs. The provision cannot apply to Redberry's offer of compromise, however, because the applicant not only rejected the respondent's offer but was wholly unsuccessful in the claim. In this circumstance, O 23 r 11(5) of the Rules has no application: see Coshott v Learoyd [1999] FCA 276 at [37] per Wilcox J; Dukemaster [2003] FCAFC 1 at [6] per Sundberg and Emmett JJ; and Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [32] per Sackville J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FCA 1628">10 In my view the appropriate disposition is that there be no order as to costs. I cannot say that rejection of the offer was unreasonable within the meaning of s 824. Nor was the application for the stay incompetent or unsupportable. There were good reasons for the stay application to be brought and I have touched on those in Harbour City Real Estate No 1 at [13] and [14]. While there would, in circumstances to which s 824(2) applies, be scope for an award of indemnity costs, the mere fact alone that an offer is made and rejected is not of itself generally regarded as being sufficient to justify an award of indemnity costs. Rather, the rejection of the offer must be unreasonable or imprudent: see Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 ; Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [59] - [62] , University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 at [36] and MGICA v Kenny (1996) 70 FCR 236. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FCA 1526">16 The approach taken in Alpine Hardwoods (Aust) Pty Ltd v Hardys Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 224 ; (2002) 190 ALR 121 at [27] - [28], in following the Full Federal Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 was that is necessary to focus on the reasonableness of the conduct of the offeree in rejecting the offer. Insofar as the applicant relies upon a rejection of the offer of compromise, the applicant must demonstrate that the conduct of the respondent was imprudent or unreasonable. However, the cases have also stressed that there is no super added requirement that it show a higher standard of unreasonableness such as 'plainly unreasonable': see Black v Lipovac at [218], Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [59] - [62] and University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 at [36] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] FCA 1056">36 On the question of the level of unreasonableness necessary to attract the discretion, I respectfully agree with the comment of Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1489 ; (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [62] questioning the utility of substituting a requirement that rejection be "plainly unreasonable" for the requirement that it be "unreasonable". Given the evaluative character of the judgment involved the addition of the word "plainly" which is itself evaluative, has no useful function. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FCA 126">5 The authorities establish that, where an applicant's offer of compromise is not accepted by the respondent and the applicant subsequently obtains a more favourable result from the Court, an order for payment for costs on an indemnity basis does not automatically follow: see Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Limited [2003] FCAFC 1 at [7] . Where the requirements of O 23 r 11(4) are satisfied, the entitlement to an order for costs on an indemnity basis in respect of costs incurred after the date of the offer is subject to the discretion of the Court. When considering the exercise of this discretion, it is necessary to take into account whether it was imprudent or unreasonable to expect the offeree to accept the offer of compromise, having regard to the context and circumstances in which it was given: see Seven Network Ltd News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 at [39] .</sentence>

 [2008] SADC 3 
 
 Introduction 
 In delivering judgment in this matter [1] I made the following orders: 
(i) The claim by the plaintiff (Sneaths Freightlines Pty Ltd) is allowed in part;
 
(ii) The counterclaim by the defendant (Theo Pertsinidis) insofar as it relates to the accounting exercise, is allowed in part;
 
(iii) The defendant is to pay the plaintiff the sum of $1,189 together with the sum of $850 by way of a lump sum in lieu of interest, making a total of $2,039;
 
(iv) In all other respects the counterclaim of the defendant is dismissed. The facts and my findings are set out in the primary judgment. For these reasons, I do not think that the defendant acted imprudently and unreasonably, looking at the counterclaim prospectively at the time, in not accepting the plaintiff's offer.

22 In Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 ( 'Dukemaster' ) Sundberg and Emmett JJ said, in a case like the present where O 23 r 11 did not apply because an applicant had been wholly unsuccessful, that an applicant for a more generous award of costs than party-party costs 'must show that the rejection of the offer was imprudent or plainly unreasonable' (see at [7]). There has been doubt expressed about the soundness of the statement in Dukemaster that rejection of an offer, if unreasonable, must be 'plainly unreasonable' in the light of the earlier judgment of a Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] --- [218], to which Wilcox J also referred in Coshott (see Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1489 at [59] --- [62] ( 'Seven Network' )). I do not need to express any view on this issue because, as will be seen, even if the stricter test of 'plainly unreasonable' is to be applied where appropriate, I do not need to apply it to my consideration of the present application. It will be sufficient to assess whether rejection of the offer was imprudent (see also APF Properties Pty Ltd v Kestrel Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2016 at [24] --- [25]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2007] FCA 2059">2 Following delivery of the Principal Judgment, all the Respondents, other than the PBL, Telstra and Optus parties (' Costs Respondents ') resolved their claims for costs against Seven. On 26 September 2007, I gave judgment on the application of the Costs Respondents for an award of costs in their favour against Seven on an indemnity basis. I rejected the application, with the result that each of the Costs Respondents became entitled to an order for costs against Seven on the usual party and party basis: Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 (' Costs Judgment ').</sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2007] FCA 1533">8 There are other formulations to similar effect, some of which were discussed recently by Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1489. Basically, they contemplate that there can be a departure from the usual rule where an application can be seen to have had no chance of success. The respondents contend that the present application matched that description. The evidence-in-chief on behalf of the applicant was filed by affidavit. It ought to have been obvious that it did not support the existence of any agreement of the type alleged and was, in any event, at odds with the case as pleaded. </sentence>
