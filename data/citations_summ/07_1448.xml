[21] Thus the Court will ordinarily conclude that there is a serious question to be tried if there is a probability, on the evidence, that the applicant would be entitled to relief on the claims made. [22] The Court does not normally enter into the merits of the proposed derivative action to any great degree, but rather considers whether there is evidence to support the claims. [23] Whilst "an indication of the evidence" without actual evidence is insufficient to demonstrate a serious question to be tried, the Court may draw inferences where those inferences are open on the material before the Court, particularly if the respondents have not led any evidence.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] NSWSC 166">In Vinciguerra, Gilmour J accepted the submission that, in approaching the 237(2)(d) criterion, the court must proceed, as explained in Ragless, by identifying the legal or equitable rights to be determined at trial in respect of which the final relief is sought. His Honour went on to say (and Mr Aldridge places some weight on this) that the application must be supported by evidence, a "mere indication of the evidence" without actual evidence being insufficient ( citing South Johnstone Mill Ltd v Dennis [2007] FCA 1448 ; (2007) 163 FCR 343 ; (2007) ACSR 447 at [81] ) and that it is the plaintiff that bears the onus of providing sufficient material to enable the court to make this determination (citing Charlton v Baber at [55]). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCAFC 31">On the good faith requirement, (s 237(2)(b) CA), the view taken by the primary judge (at [55]) was that it was not necessary for Mr Vinciguerra, himself, to depose to his belief that MGCC would have a good cause of action. It was necessary only for the Court to be satisfied that he was acting in good faith: South Johnston Hill Ltd v Dennis [2007] FCA 1448 ; (2007) 163 FCR 343 (at [67]-[69]); Maher v Honeysett &amp; Maher Electrical Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 859 (at [32]-[37]). As against that, it was not simply a matter of bald assertion: Swansson v R A Pratt Properties Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 583 ; (2002) 42 ACSR 313 (at [36]). Despite that, Mr Vinciguerra did depose to his holding the belief and to his purposes. His Honour was satisfied as to Mr Vinciguerra's good faith by assessing the nature of the allegations, the circumstances in which they arose and looking at the objective facts to enable him to draw an inference. It was clear that the basis of Mr Vinciguerra's belief was the content and conclusion reached by Mr Gorey in the Gorey Report. </sentence>

So much was decided by Middleton J in South Johnstone Mill Ltd v Dennis [2007] FCA 1448 ; (2007) 163 FCR 343. For the reasons his Honour their discussed at [24]-[63], with which I respectfully agree, I am satisfied that the Court has power to do so. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] VSC 287">21 The applicant has not deposed to an honest belief of a good cause of action with reasonable prospects of success, but that belief may be inferred reasonably by the Court, if the Court is satisfied that the applicant is acting in good faith. [13] It is sufficiently apparent from the content of the correspondence passing between the solicitors for the parties that the applicant is acting in good faith. At least, there is no suggestion of any collateral purpose that arises on the material before the Court. I further note that the applicant through her counsel proffered a number of undertakings to the Court directed to ensuring that the company is not at risk of adverse costs orders by reason of an order obtained on an interim basis. In my view, satisfaction of this criterion can be inferred from the presently available material. 
 
  2 The Court has the express power to make an interim order on an application for leave. [1]  
 
 5 If all of the five criteria have been met, the Court is bound to grant the application. [3] The prevailing view is that failure to satisfy any one of those criteria means that leave must be refused. [4] The applicant for leave bears the onus of satisfying the Court on the balance of probabilities that each of the criteria has been satisfied. [5] 
 
  The express concern was that there was no appellate decision confirming that the Court had the power to give leave nunc pro tunc. The question was considered at first instance by Middleton J in South Johnston Mill Ltd v Dennis &amp; Scales. [21] In carefully considered reasons His Honour concluded that the Court does have such power. I agree with His Honour's conclusions for the reasons he expressed.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] NSWCA 183">163 Mr Leeming submitted that the trial judge determined the issues as if it were a final hearing, rather than considering whether Mr Oates had met the lower threshold of establishing a "serious question to be tried" . He submits that under section 237(2)(d) there is no requirement for the court to make factual determinations about contested issues: Ehsman v Nutectime International Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 887 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 705 at 707-8 [6] per Austin J; South Johnstone Mill Ltd v Dennis [2007] FCA 1448 ; (2007) 163 FCR 343 at 357 [80] per Middleton J. He submits that in deciding whether there is a serious question to be tried the court will not normally enter into the merits of the proposed derivative action to any great degree: Swansson v RA Pratt Properties Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 583 ; (2002) 42 ACSR 313 at 318-9 [25] per Palmer J; Carpenter v Pioneer Park at [17] per Barrett J. He submits that that standard is "relatively low" : Maher v Honeysett at [19] per Brereton J; Ehsman v Nutectime International Pty Ltd at 718 [59] per Austin J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 696">The criteria for the grant of leave are set out in s 237(2) of the Act. The Court must grant leave if the criteria in s 237(2) of the Act are satisfied. Cemcon bears the onus of satisfying the Court that the criteria have been met: South Johnstone Mill Ltd v Dennis [2007] FCA 1448 ; (2007) 163 FCR 343 at [60] --- [61]. First Criterion - Probable that HCC will not bring proceedings: s 237(2)(a) of the Act
  Regardless of the test, the Court does not make factual determinations: South Johnstone [2007] FCA [2007] FCA 1448 ; 1448 ; 163 FCR 343 at [80] . Moreover, it would be inappropriate on an application for leave to reach any conclusion about the strength of the arguments each side would seek to make in relation to each of the issues identified above. As the summary of facts demonstrates (see [3] to [9] above), the issues in dispute raise serious questions to be tried.  Again, the principles to be applied are summarised by Middleton J in South Johnstone ; [2007] FCA 1448 ; 163 FCR 343 at [77] to [80]. There are two stages. First, consideration of the evidence in support of the application. Secondly, that evidence must attain a certain threshold. In South Johnstone at [79], Middleton J adopted the threshold or test referred to by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 at [65] when seeking a grant of an interlocutory injunction - that the applicant must demonstrate a prima facie case, which "did not mean that the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed; it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial": cf the Explanatory Memorandum to the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998 where the test for "serious question" was actually described as an 'alternative' to having the applicant demonstrate a prima facie case and that all that was required was that "the applicant ... simply ... show that proceedings should be commenced".  The principles are now well established: South Johnstone [2007] FCA [2007] FCA 1448 ; 1448 ; 163 FCR 343 at [64] - [69]. First, an applicant must honestly believe that a good cause of action exists with a reasonable prospect of success, and secondly the applicant must not seek to bring the derivative proceeding for a collateral process that would amount to an abuse of process: see Swansson v RA Pratt Properties Pty Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 311 at [36].  In applying the principles to be applied (summarised by Middleton J in South Johnstone [2007] FCA 1448 ; 163 FCR 343 at [70] to [73]), I consider that the Derivative Proceeding is in the best interests of HCC. The Derivative Proceeding seeks recovery of property in which HCC holds legal title in its capacity as trustee of the HFUT and, further, Cemcon has accepted it will bear the costs of the proceeding if it is unsuccessful. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 520">The principles are now well established: South Johnstone [2007] FCA 1448 ; 163 FCR 343 at [64] - [69].  Regardless of the test, the Court does not make factual determinations: South Johnstone [2007] FCA 1448 ; 163 FCR 343 at [80] . Moreover, it would be inappropriate on an application for leave to reach any conclusion about the strength of the arguments each side would seek in relation to each of the issues identified above. As the summary of facts demonstrates (see [9] to [37] above), the issues in dispute concern the structure and management of Betta Products. For present purposes, it is sufficient to identify at least three issues that raise serious questions to be tried: (a) the circumstances under which the various transfers/issues of shares described in [12]-[29] occurred; (b) the ability of a director to charge private expenses to the account of Betta Products in the absence of any evidence that each transaction was specifically and properly authorised by Betta Products (cf e.g. Shum Yip Properties Development Ltd v Chatswood Investment and Development Co Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 13 ; (2002) 40 ACSR 619 at [172] and (c) the existence and operation of any loan agreement that may have existed between Mr Crampton and his daughter Ms Crampton and how this agreement impacts upon the legal implications of the conduct in (b) (described at [33]-[34] above).  In light of that opposition, on 4 May 2009, Markwood Court filed separate proceedings by way of originating process ("VID 338 of 2009") seeking leave to file proceeding VID 176 of 2009 in the name of Betta Products. This was consistent with the procedure adopted in RTP Holdings Pty Ltd [2000] SASC 386 ; 36 ACSR 170. On any view, it is possible for leave to commence proceedings in the name of Betta Products to be granted nunc pro tunc: South Johnstone Mill Ltd v Dennis [2007] FCA 1448 ; (2007) 163 FCR 343 at [24] - [59] and RTP Holdings Pty Ltd [2000] SASC 386 ; 36 ACSR 170. Accordingly, any procedural objection raised by Mr Crampton to the application being commenced in VID 176 of 2009 falls away. BACKGROUND TO THE PROCEEDINGS 
 BETTA PRODUCTS
  The criteria for the grant of leave are set out in s 237(2) of the Act. The Court must grant leave if the criteria in s 237(2) of the Act are satisfied. Markwood Court bears the onus of satisfying the Court that the criteria have been met: South Johnstone [2007] FCA 1448 ; 163 FCR 343 at [60] --- [61]. First Criterion - Probable that Betta Products will not bring proceedings: s 237(2)(a) of the Act
  In applying the principles to be applied (summarised by Middleton J in South Johnstone [2007] FCA 1448 ; 163 FCR 343 at [70] to [73]), I consider that the Derivative Proceeding is in the best interests of Betta Products. The Derivative Proceeding seeks recovery of Betta Products' property for Betta Products (see also paras [47] --- [49] below) and, further, Markwood Court and its principal have accepted they will bear the costs of the proceeding if it is unsuccessful. Fourth Criterion - Serious Question to be Tried: s 237(2)(d) of the Act
  Again, the principles to be applied are summarised by Middleton J in South Johnstone [2007] FCA 1448 ; 163 FCR 343 at [77] to [80]. There are two stages. First, consideration of the evidence in support of the application. Secondly, that evidence must attain a certain threshold.

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] NSWSC 80">99 A question arose whether leave could be granted, nunc pro tunc, at the close of the trial and in the course of a final judgment. Ultimately, Mr Spinks, solicitor, who presented the case for Irene, Regina and Joanna very ably, did not submit that such leave could not now be granted. He very properly referred me to cases in which leave under CA s 237 had been granted nunc pro tunc on the basis that absence of leave at the time of commencing proceedings was a procedural irregularity which could be cured by the Court: see South Johnstone Mill Ltd v Dennis [2007] FCA 1448 , 64 ACSR 447 , at paras [24]-[56], per Middleton J; McLean v Lake Como Venture Pty Ltd [2003] QCA 562 ; [2004] 2 Qd R 280 ; Maher v Honeysett &amp; Maher Electrical Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 859 per Brereton J.

 ALLSTATE EXPLORATIONS NL (ACN 000 679 023), 
 WILLIAM HARRY CARNE MATTHEWS and LIDIA JOAN MATTHEWS 
 v MICHAEL RYAN and ANTONY WOODINGS 

 
 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT TENNENT J 
 10 December 2008 
 

 1 On 19 March 2008, a writ was filed in this Court by which Allstate Explorations NL and William Harry Carne Matthews ("Matthews") and Lidia Joan Matthews as plaintiffs, sought relief from Michael Ryan and Antony Woodings as defendants. The statement of claim attached to the writ comprised 88 paragraphs and substantially dealt with issues of negligent misrepresentation. The writ has not been served. Matthews and his wife were at all relevant times shareholders in Allstate. The writ incorporated claims by Matthews on behalf of Allstate, and claims on behalf of he and his wife personally.  19 If there is any question that proceeding in this manner could constitute an abuse of process because the writ should not have been issued in any event prior to a leave application, I am satisfied that neither the Act, s236 nor s237, mandates that a grant of leave must be had prior to the institution of proceedings, and that such an application may be dealt with before or after the commencement of those proceedings. ( South Johnstone Mill Ltd v Dennis and Scales [2007] FCA 1448 ; (2007) 163 FCR 343). 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] TASSC 40">14 The legislation requires the Court to grant leave to a person referred to in s236(1)(a) if the criteria set out in s237(2) are satisfied. The converse was conceded by counsel for the applicants. That is to say, it was conceded that if the applicants fail to satisfy the Court as to the existence of any one or more of the criteria the application must be refused. This concession is in accordance with the prevailing view. In South Johnstone Mill Ltd v Dennis &amp; Scales [2007] FCA 1448 ; [2007] 163 FCR 343 , Middleton J said at par60:
 
 
 "As set out above, a person referred to in s 236(1)(a) may apply to the court for leave to bring proceedings. On such application, the court must grant leave if the criteria set out in s 237(2) are satisfied. The prevailing view is that failure to satisfy any one of these criteria means that leave must be refused: see Jeans v Deangrove Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 84 at [9] per Santow J; Goozee v Graphic World Holdings Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 640 ; (2002) 42 ACSR 534 at [27] per Barrett J; Herbert v Redemption Investments Ltd [2002] QSC 340 at [25] per Mackenzie J; Maher v Honeysett [2005] NSWSC 859 at [12] per Brereton J; compare Fiduciary Ltd v Morningstar Research Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 442 ; [2005] NSWSC 442 ; (2005) 53 ACSR 732 at [16] , where Austin J found it unnecessary to decide the point. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] NSWSC 618">79 Although Mr Anderson bears the onus of establishing good faith, and has not directly given evidence about his motives or purposes (and has not been asked any questions about these matters in cross-examination), my view is that good faith is clearly established here. It is not a requirement that the applicant deposes to his belief, as long as the court is satisfied that the applicant is acting in good faith on the evidence presented: South Johnstone Mill Ltd v Dennis and Scales [2007] FCA 1448 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 447 , at [69] per Middleton J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] NSWSC 464">71 For leave to be granted under s 237 , it is necessary that all the sub-section (2) criteria be satisfied. If any of them is not satisfied, leave must be refused: Jeans v Deangrove Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 84 ; Goozee v Graphic World Group Holdings Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 640 ; (2002) 42 ACSR 534 ; Charlton v Baber [2003] NSWSC 745 ; (2003) 47 ACSR 31 ; Herbert v Redemption Investments Pty Ltd [2002] QSC 340 ; Fiduciary Ltd v Morningstar Research Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 442 ; Maher v Honeysett &amp; Maher Electrical Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 859 ; South Johnstone Mill Ltd v Dennis and Scales [2007] FCA 1448 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 447. </sentence>
