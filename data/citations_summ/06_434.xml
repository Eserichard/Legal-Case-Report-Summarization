<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1050">As to Mr Rana's alleged cause of action for damages against the University of Adelaide for defamation for which the University was alleged to be vicariously liable, the claim, while hopelessly misconceived, was in form for a personal injury or wrong done to him: s 116(2)(g). As such, it could be said not to be of a type that would vest in the Trustee. Nonetheless, it failed for the same reason as did all of the claims made against the University. The actions giving rise to those claims were done by a person acting in his private capacity and not as an employee of the University. In this sense this claim was integrally interconnected in the proceedings with the other non-personal claims made in SAD 12 of 2008 which made up the real substance of that litigation. In these circumstances I regard it as unnecessary here to enter upon any consideration of apportionment of Mr Rana's claims against the University: cf Faulkner v Bluett [1981] FCA 3 ; (1981) 52 FLR 115 at 115; Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 434 at [47] and [51] for the purposes of A20 of 2008. Apportionment was not raised before me in any event. It was for the Trustee, not Mr Rana, to determine whether the show cause application would be prosecuted. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1305">Justice Spender declined to reinstate the proceedings. 07.04.06 Mr Rogers commenced proceedings QUD130/2006, relying on virtually identical facts, matters and circumstances as those previously alleged by Mrs Rogers and him in previous matters in the Federal Court. 20.04.06 Justice Greenwood dismissed the application for interlocutory relief and reserved costs in proceeding QUD130/2006: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434. 12.10.06 The Respondents in proceeding QUD525/2005 apply for the proceeding to be dismissed or permanently stayed. Justice Spender reserved his decision. 19 In one of those earlier cases, Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434 Greenwood J commented (at [48]):
 It may be that when Mr Rogers or his advisers formulate a statement of claim in the proceeding, a claim might emerge which, in terms of its material facts, reflects a claim within the exemption reliant upon conduct which involves a contravention of ss 52 , 51AC or 60 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) independently of any of the former rights of the bankrupt in property which have become vested in the trustee. At the moment the material does not establish any such right. The alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) which are mere conclusionary assertions are relied upon as the basis for final orders with respect to the interests of the bankrupt in property which interests have become vested in the trustee. </sentence>

 38 Notwithstanding the voluminous material in the Statement of Claim, the concern of Mrs Rogers in these proceedings as at December 2005 was directed at obtaining orders in relation to property at Fingal in New South Wales, which had been the subject of orders of the New South Wales Supreme Court in the matter 5702/2005. 39 In the proceedings before me, Mrs Rogers alleged that the respondents were seeking to enforce an improperly obtained consent judgment and writ in respect of the Fingal property.</sentence>

I have had regard to the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434 and the reasons for judgment of Collier J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1708. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 195">62 Having regard to the matters discussed at [40] --- [58], I am satisfied that there is no prospect of the applicant succeeding in the proceeding if it were allowed to go to trial in the ordinary way and thus there is a high degree of certainty of the ultimate outcome. That degree of certainty is informed not just by deficiencies in the pleading but by reason of the weight to be given to all of the factors discussed at [40] --- [58]. In addition to the chronology identified at [20] of these reasons, the applicant has agitated these same matters previously and the history of those steps is identified at [26] and [27] in the Reasons for Judgment in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434 , which also deals with the legal standing of Mr Rogers to maintain the collection of claims set out in his application in the present proceeding (see [28] --- [53]). Accordingly, it seems to me that there is no arguable error on the part of her Honour in concluding that the statement of claim must fail in its entirety and that the appropriate order pursuant to Order 20, rule 2 of the Federal Court Rules is that the action be dismissed generally.  19 Her Honour then considered the question of whether leave ought to be given to deliver a further amended statement of claim. In considering that matter, her Honour had regard to the previous attempts on the part of Mr Rogers to formulate a claim properly falling within the scope of s 116(2)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act . The particular matters of relevance were these. Mr Rogers previously sought various orders against the present respondents including interlocutory relief restraining the respondents from exercising a power of sale and relief in respect of a number of loan agreements, deeds of settlement, mortgages and other instruments relating to various properties ( Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434 ; particularly note paragraphs [8] to [27] of the reasons). In that decision, the court determined that the majority of the claims made by Mr Rogers for final relief involved claims relating to the legal or beneficial interests of Mr Rogers in property which vested in his trustee in bankruptcy and accordingly, the applicant had no standing to institute proceedings for relief in respect of those matters ([2006] FCA 434 at [35]). However, Mr Rogers also contended that he sought to assert a claim for final relief arising out of conduct on the part of the respondents which, properly formulated, fell within the exemption contemplated by s 116(2)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act . Although the majority of the claims made by Mr Rogers were dismissed, the court made it clear ( Rogers v Asset Loan Co [48]), that the task confronting Mr Rogers was to formulate a statement of claim which in terms of its material facts, properly identified a claim to recover damages or compensation for personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt arising out of conduct in contravention of the relevant provisions of the TPA upon which Mr Rogers relies.  19 Her Honour then considered the question of whether leave ought to be given to deliver a further amended statement of claim. In considering that matter, her Honour had regard to the previous attempts on the part of Mr Rogers to formulate a claim properly falling within the scope of s 116(2)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act .

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] FCA 1708">4 The factual background to this matter is set out at some length in the judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434 at [8] ---[27]. The applicant and the respondents before his Honour were the same parties as are currently before me. Before his Honour, the applicant sought various orders, including interlocutory relief restraining the respondents from exercising a power of sale, and in respect of a number of loan agreements, deeds of settlement, mortgages and other instruments relating to various properties. 24 As Greenwood J noted in his judgment ([2006] FCA 434 at [4]) with respect to the claims of the applicant against the respondents, the most immediate difficulty confronting the applicant is the question of whether he has standing in connection with this litigation, on the basis that a sequestration order in respect of the applicant's estate was made on 23 February 2005. His Honour explained:
 
&#8226; the effect of s 58 Bankruptcy Act , which vests the property of the bankrupt in the registered trustee (at [36])
 
&#8226; the meaning of 'property of the bankrupt' for the purposes of s 58 , which is defined as 'the property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors; and any rights and powers in relation to that property that would have been exercisable by the bankrupt if he or she had not become a bankrupt' (at [36])
 
&#8226; the fact that property divisible amongst the creditors for the purposes in s 116 includes 'the capacity to exercise, and to take proceedings for exercising all such powers in, over or in respect of property as might have been exercised by the bankrupt for his own benefit at the commencement of the bankruptcy or at any time after the commencement of the bankruptcy and before his discharge' (at [37])
 
&#8226; that only the trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to seek remedial orders in respect of property, contractual rights, security interests, and related entitlements (at [43])
 
&#8226; that the exemption in s 116(2)(g) with respect to wrongs done to the bankrupt is limited to those cases where the essential cause of action is the personal injury done to the person or feelings of the bankrupt, as distinct from where the damages or part of them are to be estimated by reference to the bankrupt's rights of property (at [45]-[47]; cf Daemar v Industrial Commission of New South Wales (1988) 79 ALR 591 at 601, Cox v Journeaux (No 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 721, Faulkner v Bluett [1981] FCA 3 ; (1981) 52 FLR 115 at 119)
 
&#8226; that a claim with respect to a wrong done to the applicant characterised by reference to the anxiety, stress and pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of a recognised cause of action remains with the applicant under s 116(2)(g) Bankruptcy Act (at [46]) and
 
&#8226; that in the case before his Honour the claims were not claims for damages founded upon immediate reference to the distress and anxiety caused to the bankrupt without reference to his rights of property (at [49]); further the applicant's claim for final relief was a consequential claim necessarily connected with the applicant's interests in property (at [50]). 

6 Mr Rogers claimed that the matters he sought to agitate before his Honour by way of final relief and interlocutory relief fell within the exemption contemplated by s 116(2)(g) Bankruptcy Act because, properly understood, the claims constituted a claim with respect to a 'wrong done to the bankrupt' and the right to recover damages or compensation for each wrong remained with the applicant. As his Honour summarised:
 
 'In effect, Mr Rogers says a claim based upon conduct on the part of the respondents that bears the statutory character of misleading or deceptive conduct or unconscionable conduct on the part of ALC or ALCPL (or the respondents more generally) in connection with the supply of financial services reflected in the various deeds, is a claim for compensation for a wrong which Mr Rogers is entitled to assert. ' ([2006] FCA 434 at [40])  139 Although ordinarily a party should be given an opportunity to replead in accordance with the rules ( Turner v The Bulletin Newspaper Co Pty Ltd [1974] HCA 25 ; (1974) 131 CLR 69 per Barwick CJ (Mason J agreeing) at 81; cf Fox Symes at [95]) in my view it would be unjust to the respondents to allow the applicant yet another opportunity to re-plead. In particular I note:
 
&#8226; Greenwood J had earlier dismissed an application by the applicant for interlocutory relief in this matter on the basis that, inter alia , the applicant lacked standing to bring the application, but noted that it was possible that the applicant could formulate a statement of claim involving rights which had not vested in the trustee in bankruptcy ( Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434 at [48] )
 
&#8226; on 15 June 2006 the applicant filed a Statement of Claim
 
&#8226; on 19 June 2006 the applicant filed an Amended Statement of Claim, although this amended statement of claim was not provided to the respondents until 29 June 2006 when the parties appeared in Court
 
&#8226; when this matter came before me for the notice of motion to be heard on 29 June 2006, it became apparent that the applicant would in fact need to file a further amended statement of claim. I ordered that the applicant be given 21 days in which to file a further amended statement of claim
 
&#8226; the applicant did so in compliance with this order, but then also filed a second further amended statement of claim 10 days later. 5 At that hearing the respondents submitted, and Greenwood J found, that the majority of Mr Rogers' claims for final relief involved claims related to the legal or beneficial interest of the applicant in property which vested in the trustee in bankruptcy, and accordingly in respect of which the applicant had no standing to institute legal proceedings ([2006] FCA 434 at [35]). However his Honour noted that s 116(2) Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (' Bankruptcy Act ') excised categories of property from the interests, rights, capacities and powers divisible among the bankruptcy's creditors, including:
 
 '... 
 (g) any right of the bankrupt to recover damages or compensation; 
 
 
 (i) for personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt, the spouse of the bankrupt or a member of the family of the bankrupt; 
 ... 
 And any damages or compensation recovered by the bankrupt (whether before or after he or she became a bankrupt) in respect of such an injury or wrong. ' </sentence>
