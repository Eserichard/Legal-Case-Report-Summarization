<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 39">The extent to which s 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) (" Acts Interpretation Act ") permits a " reading down " of an instrument was considered in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) [2007] FCA 1905 , 99 ALD 268 at 278 to 279. Bennett J there observed: 
 
 Does s 46 of the Interpretation Act apply to the Competition Notice? 
 

 
 
 [55] Section 46 of the Interpretation Act is applied as a rule of construction to permit the reading down of instruments.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1640">26 Telstra relies on the decision of Bennett J in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) [2007] FCA 1905 ; (2007) 99 ALD 268 ( Telstra v ACCC (No 3) ). That case concerned a Pt A competition notice issued by ACCC under s 151AKA of the Act. Section 151AKA(10) provided, relevantly, that ACCC must not issue such a notice unless it had first given the addressee carrier or carriage service provider a written notice inviting it to make a submission to ACCC on the proposal to issue the Pt A competition notice. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1436">237 A final submission put by Telstra is that the public interest in the finality of litigation tells against a grant of leave to reopen, referring to Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) [2007] FCA 1905 ; (2007) 99 ALD 268 at [16] . However, the circumstances of that case are far removed from those of the present one. Importantly, it was not possible for Request to tender the additional documents during the hearing, and I had not delivered judgment when the notice of motion seeking leave to reopen was filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 644">There was no suggestion by the applicant that if condition 8202 was ultra vires the legislation where subclause (3)(b) came into play, that subclause could not be severed, consistent with s.46 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) (see Evans v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 945 and on appeal at [2003] FCAFC 276 ; (2003) 135 FCR 306 and Telstra Corp Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission No 3 [2007] FCA 1905 ; (2007) 99 ALD 268 at [50] per Bennett J). Rather, counsel for the applicant contended generally that condition 8202(3)(a) was analogous to condition 8202(3)(b) and hence invalid or ultra vires on the same basis . However subclause 3(a) does not suffer from the uncertainty or unreasonableness identified in subclause 3(b) by Gyles J at [34] --- [37] in Dai . It has not been established that it compelled compliance by the visa holder with " requirements that were not practicable or certain " ( Dai at [34]). The attendance obligation was imposed on the visa holder provided the pre-requisite or condition precedent that the education provider kept attendance records was met. Compliance was then in the hands of the visa holder, in the sense that achieving the requisite level of attendance was the act of the visa holder. The extent and nature of the requirements that had to be met (attendance for at least 80 per cent of the contact hours scheduled for the specified period) were sufficiently certain, having regard to the definition of contact hours in reg.1.03. Condition 8202(3)(a) is not so " vaguely expressed that either its meaning or its application is a matter of real uncertainty " (cf Kitto J in Television Corporation Ltd v Commonwealth [1963] HCA 30 ; (1963) 109 CLR 59 at 70 and see Dai at [36] per Gyles J). Given that the obligation under condition 8202(3)(a) arises only where an education provider keeps attendance records and that the requisite attendance is expressed as a percentage of total "contact hours" in a specified period (and not as a more vaguely expressed requirement) such condition has not been shown to be uncertain in either expression or operation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCAFC 24">104 However, the debate which is revealed in these authorities has been overtaken by the terms of the amended form of s 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act . That section specifically applies to instruments that are not legislative. It plainly applies to notices under s 16 of the Act. This is supported by the decision in Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) [2007] FCA 1905. </sentence>
