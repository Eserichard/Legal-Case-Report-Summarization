<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 282">The broad approach to the question, in contrast, looks to the overall financial position of the company. In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Neo Rock Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 129 , Logan J held at [10] that: 
 
"The evidence led on behalf of Neo Rock on the application is noteworthy for its absence of reference to the overall financial position of that company. There is no evidence which touches upon the assets and liabilities of the company generally, its profit and loss, its balance sheet, or its solvency, either having regard to the debt as it presently stands (which has its origins in that which supported the statutory demand) or otherwise howsoever. " 
 
  If it is not owed, the company may be solvent if Mr Colosimo's evidence as to the payment of creditors is accepted. Accordingly, s 459S(2) is satisfied in relation to the grounds that Radiancy (Sales) is not a creditor, or that the alleged debt is genuinely disputed. The observation that "material to proving" is not the same as "determinative of" may not sit happily with approaches under which the relevant test has been taken to be whether the ground of defence "represents the difference between solvency and insolvency" ( HVAC Construction (Qld) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1638 ; (2002) 44 ACSR 169 at [53] or "is pivotal to the question of solvency" ( Grant Thornton Services (NSW) Pty Ltd v St George Wholesale Distributors Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1777 at [19] ; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Neo Rock Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 129 at [9] ). For reasons to be mentioned presently, I do not need to reach a conclusion on any difference of emphasis or approach that may emerge from the cases, although my inclination is to think that "material to proving" is not the same as "determinative of" and that a capacity to have some influence or effect is, in general, all that is necessary to make something "material to proving" . " (my emphasis)

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 845">In addition to the question of construction of the relevant provision of the Act, his Honour also turned to some of the affidavit material and the facts reflected in those affidavits. At [10] of the primary judge's reasons in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Neo Rock Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 129 on 12 February 2009, the primary judge said this: 
 The evidence lead on behalf of Neo Rock on the application is noteworthy for its absence of reference to the overall financial position of that company. There is no evidence which touches upon the assets and liabilities of the company generally, its profit and loss, its balance sheet, or its solvency, either having regard to the debt as it presently stands (which has its origins in that which supported the statutory demand) or otherwise howsoever. The focus of the affidavit material which has been read is on dealings as between Neo Rock and the Australian Taxation Office (the ATO) in the context of an as yet unresolved audit of that company's taxation affairs by the ATO.
