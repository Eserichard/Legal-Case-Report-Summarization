<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 910">I accept that people express their feelings in many ways and with varying degrees of openness or inhibition: Delahunty v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 309 ; (2004) 38 AAR 511. I accept that Mr Neath had a reaction that encompassed intense fear, and helplessness, especially given his ongoing concern that Jeparit was unarmed (per Budworth and Repatriation Commission [2000] AATA 127). I observe that even 'relief' and 'concern' have been found to be capable of being appropriate responses: Renton v RC [2009] FCA 268. Therefore, the answer to the question of whether the diagnosis was one properly made having regard to DSM-IV must be answered in the affirmative, per Repatriation Commission v Warren [2007] FCA 866 ; (2007) 95 ALD 606. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] AATA 545">We accept that people express their feelings in many ways and with varying degrees of openness or inhibition: Delahunty v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 309 ; (2004) 38 AAR 511. However in respect of none of the claimed stressors did Mr Midavaine have an "extremely high level of reaction" (per Budworth ). Therefore, the answer to the question of whether the diagnosis was one properly made having regard to DSM-IV must be answered in the negative, per Repatriation Commission v Warren [2007] FCA 866 ; (2007) 95 ALD 606. Further, because the SoP contains the same diagnostic criterion in respect of response, we are not satisfied that Mr Midavaine's condition is in accordance with the definition required there: Repatriation Commission v Warren [2008] FCAFC 64 ; (2008) 101 ALD 222. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] AATA 470">In reaching this conclusion we also note the following passage from the decision of the Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v Warren [1] : 
 "It is DSM-IV as a whole which will inform a clinical diagnosis, upon which a finding will be based. The Manual itself explains that there is more to a diagnosis than the application of the criteria in a 'cookbook' fashion. A person having symptoms which fall short of meeting the stated criteria may nevertheless be diagnosed as suffering from the condition. DSM-IV refers to the need to exercise clinical judgment, which I take to include the application of experience. " 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] AATA 1608">The term "clinical worsening" was explained by Finn J in Repatriation Commission v Milenz [2006] FCA 1436 to require a clinical judgement as to whether there had been a worsening of the features and symptoms of the disorder as defined. We note that Finn J refers to the disorder as defined in the SoP, but following the decision of Keifel J in Repatriation Commission v Warren [2007] FCA 866 ; the reference must be to the disorder as either defined in the SoP or the appropriate diagnostic text. For example for Psychiatric Disorders the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. </sentence>
