 Introduction 
 Ms Mooney and Mr Elson were work colleagues who became friends. Mr Elson told Ms Mooney that he was developing a mosquito control product that would revolutionise the market and that would, to use his words, "make millions". In making the submission that the claims were not inconsistent, Ms Mooney relied upon the decision of Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Ltd. [51] Lewarne's case is an unusual fact situation and involved findings that the director had made representations on his own behalf as well as on behalf of the company. I do not make such a finding in this case. I have found that Mr Elson made the relevant representations on behalf of NDL. </sentence>
