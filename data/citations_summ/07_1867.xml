 Having regard to the authorities the remuneration Coopers Consulting received from Ajilon during the relevant years was not for producing a result within the meaning of s 87-18(3)(a) because: (a) the relevant agreement does not identify any result; Coopers Consulting was simply contracted to provide "professional business services" for the duration of the agreements; (b) Coopers Consulting was not remunerated for producing any result; it was simply remunerated for the days that the Applicant provided professional business services: clause 4.1 of the relevant agreement; (c) The remuneration Coopers Consulting received under the terms of the relevant agreement was not in any way dependent on producing a result; (d) On early termination of the relevant agreement, Coopers Consulting was entitled to "payments ... for all worked performed by the Applicant up to the date of termination" (clause 7.2 of the relevant agreement) - which supports the contention that Coopers Consulting was simply being remunerated for the provision of professional business services by the Applicant; (e) The relevant agreement did not confer any freedom on Coopers Consulting to delegate or subcontract the "professional business services", it was obligated to engage the Applicant: clauses 1.1 and 2.1 of the relevant agreement. Having regard to the preceding provisions, Coopers Consulting cannot be said to have conducted a personal services business because the remuneration it received was not for producing a result within the meaning of s 87-18(3)(a). The conclusions reached in: IRG Technical Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1867 ; 165 FCR 57 at [110] ; Dibarr Pty Ltd [2004] AATA 1030 ; 57 ATR 1183 at [43] --- [44]; Re Nguyen and Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 876 ; 2005 ATC 2304 at [38] --- [41] (Member Webb) and Taneja [2009] AATA 87 ; 2009 ATC 10-078 at [35] - [41] are entirely apposite to the circumstances in these proceedings. In particular, the conclusion in Skiba [2007] AATA 1705 ; 67 ATR 682 at [65] - [66] is particularly apt: 
 
 [65] Here, the evidence shows that the personal services income derived by the applicant was not paid upon producing a result but was a fortnightly or monthly payment based on the number of hours logged onto a weekly timesheet while working under the ultimate control of the CESPs and applying skill and effort to assist the CESPs complete the projects for their clients. 
 [66] The ongoing skilled work provided by the applicant to the CESPs is not converted into "producing a result" within the meaning of s 87-18(3) by applying the label "deliverables" where the actuality of what occurred was the performance of ongoing work by the applicant (a skilled professional selected by the CESPs and/or their clients as suitable for their needs) under the ultimate control of the CESPs during the term of the contracts. 
 [66] The ongoing skilled work provided by the applicant to the CESPs is not converted into "producing a result" within the meaning of s 87-18(3) by applying the label "deliverables" where the actuality of what occurred was the performance of ongoing work by the applicant (a skilled professional selected by the CESPs and/or their clients as suitable for their needs) under the ultimate control of the CESPs during the term of the contracts. 
 
 The failure on the part of Coopers Consulting to satisfy the requirements of "producing a result" under s 87-18(3)(a) is fatal in relation to the results test overall. It is not necessary for the Tribunal to consider the elements in s 87-18(3)(b) and (c) because the three elements in s 87-18(3) which comprise the results test are conjunctive: see IRG Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1867 ; 165 FCR 57 at [111] ; Dibarr Pty Ltd [2004] AATA 1030 ; 57 ATR 1183 at [45] and; Nguyen 2005 ATC 2304 at [45]. Nevertheless, for the reasons set out in RSFIC [53] - [57], the Tribunal notes that Coopers Consulting has not satisfied the requirements of s 87-18(3)(c), but there is evidence (of academic relevance only) which would suggest that the requirements of s 87-18(b) may have been satisfied; as set out previously the Tribunal was referred in this context to a tax return by the Company; (see also Re Dibarr Pty Ltd and Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 1030 ; 57 ATR 1183 at [46] ). Since all of the Applicant's personal services income which Coopers Consulting received in the relevant years came from one source, Ajilon, Coopers Consulting was not entitled to self assess the "unrelated clients test" (s 87-20); the "employment test" (s 87- 25 ) or the "business premises test" (s 87-30): see s 87-15(3); Metaskills Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 766 ; 130 FCR 248 at [26] . ) In accordance with s 87-18(3): 
 
 (3) A *personal services entity meets the results test in an income year if, in relation to at least 75% of the *personal services income of one or more individuals that is included in the personal services entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income during the income year:
 (a) the income is for producing a result; and
 (b) the personal services entity is required to supply the *plant and equipment, or tools of trade, needed to perform the work from which the personal services entity produces the result; and
 (c) the personal services entity is, or would be, liable for the cost of rectifying any defect in the work performed. 
 
 The results test in s 87-18(3) has been said to embrace the defining characteristics of an "independent contractor" at common law: see Metaskills [2003] FCA 766 ; [2003] FCA 766 ; 130 FCR 248 at [28] . While such common law principles are useful in interpreting s 87-18(3), it is the text of the section itself which controls the outcome: see IRG Technical Services Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1867 ; (2007) 165 FCR 57 at [37] and [47] (Allsop J); Re Taneja and Commissioner of Taxation [2009] AATA 87 ; 2009 ATC 10-078 at [27] (Deputy President Professor Walker and Member Frost). Having regard to the observations of Sheller JA in World Book (Australia) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1992) 27 NSWLR 377 at 386, the Commissioner in TR 2001/8: Income tax: what is a personal services business , at [114] defines the phrase "producing a result" in s 87-18(3)(a) to mean: 
 
 [T]he performance of a service by one party for another where the first-mentioned party is free to employ his/her own means (i.e., third party labour, plant and equipment etc) to achieve the contractually specified outcome. As the cases show, the essence of the contract has to be to achieve a result and not to do work. So too what Allsop J said in IRG Technical Services Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1867 ; 165 FCR 57 , 70[37], 71-72[47], 83-84[110] (Allsop J): 
 
 [I]n my view, the income of Mr Green (the personal services income of the relevant individual included in IRG's income) was not for producing a result. Without restricting what I have already said, it was for the performance of work as a skilled engineer in the business of the KJV as part of a co-ordinated team of engineers and remunerated on an hourly rate for such work. This work involved Mr Green producing, from time to time, documents, schedules and data sheets, and involved him in identifiable tasks and responsibilities. It would not be a reflection of substantial reality, however, to say that his income was for the results he produced. It was for his work as a skilled engineer, which work produced those results or outcomes, as a necessary professional consequence of the work of a skilled lead instrument engineer on such a project.

 (c) whether the work can be delegated and who bears the risk of costs arising from defective work. See for example, IRG Technical Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1867 ; 165 FCR 57 at [44] : 
 
 
 [44] The capacity of work to be delegated or subcontracted, if present, is a significant factor weighing in favour of a conclusion of an independent contractor. So is the question of risk of costs for defective work. 
 
 Having regard to the authorities the remuneration Coopers Consulting received from Ajilon during the relevant years was not for producing a result within the meaning of s 87-18(3)(a) because: (a) the relevant agreement does not identify any result; Coopers Consulting was simply contracted to provide "professional business services" for the duration of the agreements; (b) Coopers Consulting was not remunerated for producing any result; it was simply remunerated for the days that the Applicant provided professional business services: clause 4.1 of the relevant agreement; (c) The remuneration Coopers Consulting received under the terms of the relevant agreement was not in any way dependent on producing a result; (d) On early termination of the relevant agreement, Coopers Consulting was entitled to "payments ... for all worked performed by the Applicant up to the date of termination" (clause 7.2 of the relevant agreement) - which supports the contention that Coopers Consulting was simply being remunerated for the provision of professional business services by the Applicant; (e) The relevant agreement did not confer any freedom on Coopers Consulting to delegate or subcontract the "professional business services", it was obligated to engage the Applicant: clauses 1.1 and 2.1 of the relevant agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 215">The results test in s 87-18(3) has been said to embrace the defining characteristics of an "independent contractor" at common law: see Metaskills [2003] FCA 766 ; [2003] FCA 766 ; 130 FCR 248 at [28] . While such common law principles are useful in interpreting s 87-18(3), it is the text of the section itself which controls the outcome: see IRG Technical Services Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1867 ; (2007) 165 FCR 57 at [37] and [47] (Allsop J); Re Taneja and Commissioner of Taxation [2009] AATA 87 ; 2009 ATC 10-078 at [27] (Deputy President Professor Walker and Member Frost).  Having regard to the preceding provisions, Coopers Consulting cannot be said to have conducted a personal services business because the remuneration it received was not for producing a result within the meaning of s 87-18(3)(a). The conclusions reached in: IRG Technical Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1867 ; 165 FCR 57 at [110] ; Dibarr Pty Ltd [2004] AATA 1030 ; 57 ATR 1183 at [43] --- [44]; Re Nguyen and Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 876 ; 2005 ATC 2304 at [38] --- [41] (Member Webb) and Taneja [2009] AATA 87 ; 2009 ATC 10-078 at [35] - [41] are entirely apposite to the circumstances in these proceedings. In particular, the conclusion in Skiba [2007] AATA 1705 ; 67 ATR 682 at [65] - [66] is particularly apt: 
 
 [65] Here, the evidence shows that the personal services income derived by the applicant was not paid upon producing a result but was a fortnightly or monthly payment based on the number of hours logged onto a weekly timesheet while working under the ultimate control of the CESPs and applying skill and effort to assist the CESPs complete the projects for their clients. 
 [66] The ongoing skilled work provided by the applicant to the CESPs is not converted into "producing a result" within the meaning of s 87-18(3) by applying the label "deliverables" where the actuality of what occurred was the performance of ongoing work by the applicant (a skilled professional selected by the CESPs and/or their clients as suitable for their needs) under the ultimate control of the CESPs during the term of the contracts. 
 
  The failure on the part of Coopers Consulting to satisfy the requirements of "producing a result" under s 87-18(3)(a) is fatal in relation to the results test overall. It is not necessary for the Tribunal to consider the elements in s 87-18(3)(b) and (c) because the three elements in s 87-18(3) which comprise the results test are conjunctive: see IRG Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1867 ; 165 FCR 57 at [111] ; Dibarr Pty Ltd [2004] AATA 1030 ; 57 ATR 1183 at [45] and; Nguyen 2005 ATC 2304 at [45]. Nevertheless, for the reasons set out in RSFIC [53] - [57], the Tribunal notes that Coopers Consulting has not satisfied the requirements of s 87-18(3)(c), but there is evidence (of academic relevance only) which would suggest that the requirements of s 87-18(b) may have been satisfied; as set out previously the Tribunal was referred in this context to a tax return by the Company; (see also Re Dibarr Pty Ltd and Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 1030 ; 57 ATR 1183 at [46] ).  (There is no mention in any of them of "milestones". ) 
 

(c) whether the work can be delegated and who bears the risk of costs arising from defective work. See for example, IRG Technical Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1867 ; 165 FCR 57 at [44] :
 
 
 [44] The capacity of work to be delegated or subcontracted, if present, is a significant factor weighing in favour of a conclusion of an independent contractor. So is the question of risk of costs for defective work.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1224">That being so, the "results test" then falls to be answered. That test is found in s 87 - 18 of the ITAA 1997. In IRG Technical Services Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1867 ; (2007) 165 FCR 57 at 70, [36] , Allsop J (as his Honour then was) observed of that section that its elements "were to be understood against the background of the jurisprudence concerning independent contractors". In so doing, his Honour referred with approval to an earlier observation made by Lindgren J in Commissioner of Taxation v Metaskills Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 766 ; (2003) 130 FCR 248 at 254, [28], that, "Broadly speaking, an individual or entity, who or which is an 'independent contractor' under traditional concepts should meet the results test.". Their Honours were not in these cases promoting the use of the common law as a substitute for the language of the statute, for that would clearly be erroneous. It is just that, for example, the phrase "the income is for producing a result" in s 87 - 1 (a) and s 87 - 18 (3)(a) of the ITAA 1997 obviously draws upon one of the traditional touchstones for distinguishing between a contract for service and a contract of service. Thus guidance offered by cases decided at common law as to whether a payment is or is not for the production of a result is relevant. That this is what Parliament intended is confirmed by recourse to secondary materials, as Allsop and Lindgren JJ note in their respective judgements. Approaching the matter this way, I respectfully agree with their Honours observations in relation to s 87 - 18 . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCAFC 115">23 Sixth, the result for which the Commissioner contends leads to surprising and unexpected results. The same precondition qualifies s 14U(1)(b)(ii)(B) referring to refusal of a departure authorisation certificate being "detrimental to the interests of Australia". According to Mr Lui, it would be surprising if the Commissioner could only act to avoid a situation detrimental to the interests of Australia if the Commissioner is satisfied that increased or further security cannot be provided. This indicates that the reasonably open alternative construction should be preferred ( IRG Technical Services Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 165 FCR 57 ; [2007] FCA 1867 at [21] ). The same consideration must apply to the exception for humanitarian grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] AATA 626">In IRG Technical Services Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1867 ; (2007) 165 FCR 57 Allsop J distilled (at [21] and [22]) the principles of interpretation applied in Australia to the text of statutes including revenue statutes. Such principles, of course, apply also to statutes concerning administration of the revenue system. It is not necessary to restate his Honour's distillation, which proceeded from authority at the highest level, beyond noting the legitimacy of adopting a "construction reasonably open and more clearly conforming with the legislative intent otherwise discovered. " I have already expressed the view that a construction of s 14U(1)(b)(ii) which supports Mr Lui's claims in the present case is open but it is not the one, in my view, which more clearly conforms to the apparent legislative intent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] AATA 87">The taxpayer's submission is that, if the Commissioner accepts for the purposes of paragraph (3)(c) that the Company is liable for the cost of rectifying defects, then by implication "the contract must be for producing a result": Applicant's Submissions, C.11.c. We do not agree. Each paragraph in s 87-18(3) has independent operation: see IRG Technical Services Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1867 (" IRG "), especially at [37].

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] NSWCA 322">48 In a practical and commercial sense, Dome was not managed by the corporate entities, Goldspark or FCL: rather, it obtained from those companies the skills, expertise and time of Mr Silver. It was Mr Silver who was the person responsible for managing Dome, in relevant respects. The payment in a practical and commercial sense was made for his services. Neither he nor Dome expected that he would obtain no financial benefit for his time. Nor should the scope of the term "remuneration" be governed by ascribing a literal meaning to the introductory words of the definition, namely a benefit "given to" an officer, or one "received by" a director. For the purposes of disclosure provisions, it would make a mockery of the Corporations Law if directors had been able to avoid disclosure of their remuneration by having companies contract with their family trusts or other entities and make payment to those trusts or other entities, which did not constitute remuneration payable "to" the director. The statutory requirements, as in other fields, may require that conduct be traced through corporate entities, not stopping the analysis at the point where a new entity is introduced: cf Politis (above) and IRG Technical Services Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1867 ; 165 FCR 57 (Allsop J), both cases involving taxation laws. On this approach, the payments made to both Goldspark and FCL by Dome, for the provision of Mr Silver's personal services, constituted part of his total remuneration from the company. It was therefore, subject to other issues which should now be dealt with, a sum which could properly be inserted in the calculation required by s 200G(2).</sentence>
