<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 311">The starting point of the regime is s 84-5(1) which defines "personal services income" in the following manner: 
 
 84-5 Meaning of personal services income
 (1) Your *ordinary income or *statutory income, or the ordinary income or statutory income of any other entity, is your personal services income if the income is mainly a reward for your personal efforts or skills (or would mainly be such a reward if it was your income). 
 
 The parties agreed that the remuneration received by Coopers Consulting from Ajilon during the relevant years is personal services income for the purpose of s 84-5(1) because it was received as a reward for the "personal efforts or skills" of Mr Cooper. That agreement readily accords with the conclusions reached in Re Dibarr Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 1030 ; (2004) 57 ATR 1183 at [22] (Senior Member Beddoe and Member Fisher) and Fowler v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 528 ; (2008) 167 FCR 425 at [24] (Lindgren J). In accordance with s 86-15(1), the personal services income received by Coopers Consulting is treated as the assessable income of Mr Cooper unless the exception contained in s 86-15(3) can be relied on: 
 
 Exception: personal services businesses
 (3) This section does not apply if that amount is income from the *personal services entity conducting a *personal services business. 
 
 On the basis that Coopers Consulting is a "personal services entity" as defined by s 86-15(2), the issue to be determined is whether Coopers Consulting was conducting a personal services business.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 773">The claimed failure to take reasonable care arises from the non-disclosure in Mr Taneja's tax returns of the income attributed to him under Part 2-42 of the 1997 Act. The Commissioner says that the factual matrix in Mr Taneja's case, like that of the taxpayer in Fowler v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 528 ; (2008) 167 FCR 425 , clearly falls within the terms of Part 2-42. The Commissioner's written submissions continued at [16]: 
 
 The submissions of the applicant before the Tribunal were unorthodox and generally bespoke a lack of understanding of fundamental aspects of the [personal services income] regime [in Part 2-42]. The applicant's reliance on TR 2001/8 and the public statements of the then Treasurer of Australia were similarly without foundation.
