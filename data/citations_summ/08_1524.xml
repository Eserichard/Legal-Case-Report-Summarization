<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FWA 2910">2 Soh v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 1524 per Moore J at [10] cited in Clack v Collins (No 1) [2010] FCA 513 at 13.  7 Clack v Collins op.cit. at [13]; Soh v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 1524 per Moore J at [10]; Merribee Pastoral Industries Pty Ltd v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (1998) op. cit. at 514.  6 Soh v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 1524 per Moore J at [10]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 254">The question, then, is whether security for costs should be ordered. Adopting the order of considerations identified in Soh v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 1524 , my conclusions are as follows: 
(1) The appeal and cross-appeal involve detailed questions of fact. For present purposes all that can or should be said is that I accept that the appeal is brought in good faith. (2) I infer, for the reasons given at [14] above, that there is a high risk that a costs order in favour of STX Pan would not be satisfied by Mr Thomson. In effect, in the absence of an order for security for costs in the circumstances of this case, Mr Skyring, in effect, is given a free hit, and that seems to me to be intrinsically unfair. 
 
 

 
(4) A wide range of general discretionary facts may be relevant. As stated at [13] in Clack v Collins :
 
 
 In Soh v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 1524 , at [10], Moore J identified six factors relevant to the decision whether or not security for costs should be awarded, namely (i) the prospects of success, (ii) the quantum of risk that a costs order will not be satisfied, (iii) whether the making of a costs order would be oppressive in that it would stifle a reasonably arguable claim, (iv) whether any impecuniosity of the party from whom security is sought arises out of the conduct complained of, (v) whether there are aspects of public interest which weigh in the balance against such an order, and (vi) whether there are any particular discretionary matters peculiar to the circumstances of the case.

Consistent with the decisions to which I have referred, at [11] in Soh , Moore J also referred to the observations of Spender J in Tait v Bindal People . </sentence>
