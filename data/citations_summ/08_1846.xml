<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] VSC 532">44 Mr Moore submitted that the stronger the case to be tried, the less the balance of convenience must be inclined in favour of the applicant before an injunction will be granted. [3] Indeed, he went further and submitted that where the case is very strong, the impact of an injunction on the party to be restrained carried little weight. [4] These were persuasive submissions pointing towards the granting of an injunction in this case. </sentence>
