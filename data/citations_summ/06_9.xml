<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] ACAT 21">In Nippress v Military Rehabiliation and Compensation Commission [2006] FCA 9 43 Cowdroy J was critical of Administrative Appeals Tribunal's decision to limit consideration of the issues before by reference to concession extracted from an unrepresented litigant who did not understand the legal significance of those concessions. Cowdroy J said the Tribunal should have taken up any issues which arose in the course of the proceedings which appeared relevant to a determination of the substantive merits of the case.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] AATA 1116">Here, "that which the decision maker (that is, the Commissioner) was entrusted to do" was to decide whether to allow Mr Green's objection, either wholly or in part, or to disallow it: s 14ZY(1) of the Administration Act. He decided to disallow it. The Tribunal's jurisdiction, enlivened by Mr Green's application, exists "to do again" what was entrusted to the Commissioner --- in other words, to decide to allow the objection, either wholly or in part, or to disallow it. Hill J's qualification, inherent in the words "within the limits of the review", means nothing more than that the Tribunal's exercise of the powers and discretions of the Commissioner must be undertaken "for the purpose of reviewing [the decision under review]", in accordance with s 43 of the Administrative Appeals Act 1975 (see Commissioner of Taxation v Hornibrook (2006) 156 FCR 313 ; [2006] FCAFC 170 , especially Gyles J's reference at FCR 320 [18] to the Full Court decision in Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 244 , also referred to by Edmonds J at first instance in Commissioner of Taxation v Hornibrook (2006) 61 ATR 573 ; [2006] FCA 9 at 579 [21] ). </sentence>
