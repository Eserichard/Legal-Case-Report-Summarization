<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 688">In any event, it has not been established that there was any contravention of cl.3 of the Enterprise Agreement such as to attract penal consequences. First, not every provision in an agreement such as the Enterprise Agreement is to be taken to be intended to impose an enforceable obligation on a party so as to expose that party to the possibility of a penalty on non-compliance. In Reeves v MaxiTRANS Australia Pty Ltd (2009) 188 IR 297 ; [2009] FCA 970 Ryan J considered an application for a penalty under the Workplace Relations Act in relation to an alleged failure to consult with representatives pursuant to an enterprise agreement. The provisions in question provided for a consultative committee to consult with management on certain issues and stated that employees and management of the company were " committed to workplace improvement and effectiveness through a focus on communication and consultation through the committee ". Such provisions are not dissimilar in focus to aspects of cl.3 of the Enterprise Agreement in question in this case.</sentence>
