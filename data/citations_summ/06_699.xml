<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 62">Mr Stack submitted that this showed that the Court of Appeal treated the charges of contempt as being made in civil proceedings. The issue to which these observations went was whether for the charges to be established it was necessary that particulars of the charge be made out in their entirety, or whether only those elements of the charges necessary to establish breach of the relevant orders needed to be established (at [67]). There was no issue before the court whether the proceedings were " civil proceedings " or " criminal proceedings " within the meaning of the Civil Procedure Act . The same is true of the other authorities relied on by Mr Stack ( Energiser Australia Pty Ltd v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd (No 4) [2008] FCA 864 at [13] - [14]; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Reid [2006] FCA 699 at [18] ,[21]; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Matthews [2000] NSWSC 201 at [13]). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FamCAFC 144">In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Reid (No 1) , [27] Landner J of the Federal Court of Australia ('the Federal Court') discussed the High Court's Judgment in New South Wales v Canellis &amp; Ors [28] which further outlined the principle in Dietrich's Case . I note the following statement of his Honour: 
[10] The principle in Dietrich was explained in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ in New South Wales v Canellis &amp; Ors in the following terms:
 
'... the principle established by the decision in that case is that a court has jurisdiction to grant an adjournment or order a permanent stay of proceedings at a trial until such time as an indigent person charged with a serious criminal offence is provided with legal representation necessary for a fair trial or resources for such representation. '
 
[11] Referring to that principle, their Honours went on to say:
 
'As the majority judgments made clear, that principle is based on, and derives from, the accused's right to a fair trial. There is no suggestion in the majority judgments that a court could exercise similar jurisdiction in civil proceedings or in committal proceedings; nor do they suggest that such a jurisdiction should be exercised in favour of an indigent person charged with a criminal offence which is other than serious. ' ( Footnotes omitted )
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] WASC 65">33 The Public Trustee also submitted that at common law a citizen does not have a right to present his or her case by counsel or to have his or her case presented at the public expense. The Public Trustee referred to McInnis v The Queen [1979] HCA 65 ; (1979) 143 CLR 575 per Barwick CJ at 579, Mason J at 581; Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57 ; (1992) 177 CLR 292 , 297 - 298, 317, 330, 343, 356 and 364 - 365; New South Wales v Canellis [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 181 CLR 309 , 328 and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Reid [No 1] [2006] FCA 699. Those cases do not deal with the circumstances here, namely the circumstances of a person under a disability who is prohibited from participating in litigation and where the duty of the Lord Chancellor would have been in 1861 and hence the duty of this court, was and therefore is to ensure that incapacitated persons are properly represented in litigation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 846">14 This aspect of the reasoning of the High Court was emphasised by Lander J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Reid [2006] FCA 699. In that case, his Honour held that the principle in Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57 ; (1992) 177 CLR 292 , which allows an indigent accused in serious criminal proceedings to apply for a stay if legal representation is not provided, does not apply to proceedings for contempt of court. As Lander J pointed out, the procedure in contempt proceedings in the Federal Court is governed by FCR , O 40. In particular, O 40 r 7 requires evidence in support of a charge to be given by affidavit unless the Court directs otherwise, while O 40 r 5(1) requires an allegation that contempt has been committed in connection with a proceeding in the Court to be made by motion on notice in the proceeding. Neither of these procedural requirements applies in criminal proceedings. </sentence>
