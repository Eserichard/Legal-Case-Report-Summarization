<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 33">149 Ground 5 of the notice of appeal states:
 
 
 His Honour erred in applying Ngaronoa v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1565 to the Tribunal's consideration of the police intelligence reports and housing department records in circumstances where the Tribunal made findings that the appellant engaged in criminal conduct based on that material. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1098">The Minister submitted that the case put by the applicant on this point is similar to that rejected in Ngaronoa v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1565 (Jacobson J) at [47] --- [65], affirmed [2007] FCAFC 196 ; (2007) 244 ALR 119 at [10] --- [12]. While concerning a decision of the Minister personally, the Court stressed the width of the discretion in s 501 and the fact that weight to be attached to evidence was a matter for the decision-maker, in holding that it was open to consider charges for which an applicant had been acquitted in considering the exercise of discretion under s 501(2). Both Jacobson J at [60] and the Full Court at [10] --- [12] proceeded on the basis that the real issue was whether the Minister had acted capriciously in taking into account the charges for which the applicant had been acquitted, and concluded that he had not. Still less can the Tribunal here be said to have acted capriciously in taking into account material which was obviously relevant. Analysis
