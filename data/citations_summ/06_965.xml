(2) an appeal, as of right, from a judgment of acquittal pronounced by a superior court is not a recognized part of the appellant process in the administration of criminal law. the existence of such an appeal is contrary to a fundamental principle of the common law. it is a well-established principle of statutory interpretation that a statute is not to be taken as effecting a fundamental alteration of the general law or abolishing or modifying fundamental common law rights unless it uses words that point clearly and unambiguously to that conclusion. the general words used in s. 24(1)(a) and (b) to confer jurisdiction "to hear and determine appeals" do not confer jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals in circumstances where the existence of the jurisdiction and the right to invoke it would be contrary to a fundamental principle relating to the circumstances in which an appeal should exist and the right of the subject which finds expression in that principle. namely, the right to be spared the jeopardy of an appeal from acquittal after a hearing on the merits of a criminal charge by a court of competent jurisdiction, is not, upon proper principles of statutory interpretation to be swept aside by the general terms of a statute which has no underlying policy requiring that such terms, be given such effect and which contains nothing that points clearly or unmistakably or at all to that effect as either having been contemplated or intended.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] VSC 9">84 It was not expressly settled at the hearing whether I should proceed now to a decision as to whether any breach found should be determined or declared to amount to a criminal contempt, ie a criminal offence, as distinct from a civil contempt. The distinction may no longer be as important as it once was [57] , but it is a fraught distinction and may well be of considerable practical significance to Mr Ng: compare Seymour v Migration Agents Registration [58] . I think I should not treat the classification issue as falling to be finally decided until after I have heard the parties at the proposed "penalty" hearing. There is substantial overlap between the matters which bear on the classification issue and matters which bear on penalty. In any event, all issues as to the imposition of any actual "penalty", including even the possibility of not exercising the contempt jurisdiction at all, were agreed to be left open for further consideration at that hearing. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 5">8 In May 2004, Mr Seymour applied to the Authority for re-registration as a migration agent for the 12 month period expiring on 23 May 2005. This was refused in February 2005, but the Tribunal subsequently granted a stay of the decision under the Act as in force prior to the changes implemented by the Amending Act . Mr Seymour then made an application to the Tribunal to set aside the Authority's decision. The Tribunal decided that the Authority's decision should be set aside because the decision-maker was not authorised to make the decision. However, the Tribunal substituted its own decision and itself decided that Mr Seymour was not a fit and proper person to be registered. An appeal was then brought to the Court from the Tribunal and on 31 July 2006, Rares J dismissed that appeal: see Seymour v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2006] FCA 965. There is a detailed history of these other proceedings in relation to Mr Seymour in his Honour's judgment and it is not necessary to repeat those details in these reasons.</sentence>
