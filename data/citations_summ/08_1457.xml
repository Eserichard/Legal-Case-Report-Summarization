<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 188">72 In Bell IXL Investments Ltd v Life Therapeutics Ltd [2008] FCA 1457 Middleton J said (at [14]):
 In considering the material before the Court, the trier of fact must be careful to distinguish between inference and conjecture. A conjecture may be plausible, but it is effectively still a mere guess. An inference is a deduction from the evidence, and if reasonable can be treated as part of the legal proof to be considered in making a factual determination in any particular proceeding. Whilst sometimes it may be difficult to distinguish between conjecture and inference, nevertheless the distinction is an important one... 
His Honour's observations, with respect, state a fundamental and well established distinction which is not always observed. (See also Luxton v Vines [1952] HCA 19 ; (1952) 85 CLR 352 at 358, quoting Bradshaw v McEwans Pty Ltd (HCA (1951) unreported). </sentence>
