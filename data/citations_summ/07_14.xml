<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1423">Mr Dickinson expressed no opinion as to the quantum of costs that would be recoverable if costs were to be taxed on a party/party basis as opposed to costs recoverable if taxed on a solicitor/client basis. The difference between the two approaches was nevertheless briefly touched upon by Mr Dickinson in his first affidavit when he said: 
 
 [23] The test to be applied on a solicitor client taxation is more generous than a taxation conducted on an ordinary party party basis, particularly as the costs are not constrained by the Federal Court scale of costs. ... 
 

 
He continued on to refer expressly to the following observations of His Honour Justice Finkelstein in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Boral Ltd [2007] FCA 14: 
 
 
 [12] More usually an order for costs to be taxed on a solicitor/client basis is understood to mean that the person should recover that which he ought properly pay to his solicitor: Goodwin v Storrar [1947] 1 KB 457 at 458. The purpose of the order is to allow "as many of the charges which [the party] would have been compelled to pay to his own solicitor for costs of the action as fair justice to the other party will permit": Smith v Smith [1906] VicLawRp 12 ; [1906] VLR 78 at 80, citing from Daniels Chancery Practice. Oliver, Law of Costs (1960) p 1 states this is substantially "a party and party taxation on a more generous scale". 
 

 
In providing the opinion that he did, Mr Dickinson set forth the methodology he pursued, including the need to apply " a global percentage reduction to the profit costs and disbursements to reflect a party party taxation determined on a solicitor client basis ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 75">His Honour was bound to follow the recent Full Court decision in SZICV v Minister [2007] FCAFC 39 . 
 
 b. However, SZICV did not consider the High Court decisions in Abebe and Bodrudazza v Minister [2007] FCA 14. 
 
 c. While Parliament may be acting within the power conferred by the Constitution whenever it authorises a federal court such as the Federal Magistrates Court ("FMC") to determine rights, duties liabilities of litigants which arise out of controversies that fall within paragraphs (i) --- (v) of the section 75 of the Constitution , it nevertheless acts outside the Constitution by completely curtailing the right to any such remedy if not brought within the limitation period created by Parliament. [sic]
 
 d. It is constitutionally impermissible for Parliament to so restrict entitlement to constitutionally guaranteed rights of review.
