<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1137">It is thus clear that in a case such as this there is no room for a private compromise. There can only be a Court order and that order can only be made if the conditions set by French J are complied with. So much was affirmed by Young J in CEO of Customs v Biocontrol Ltd [2006] FCA 107 ; (2006) 150 FCR 64 at [16] : 
"The proposed consent orders relate to a matter of public law, and would involve setting aside a carefully reasoned decision of the Tribunal. It would be inappropriate for me to accede to the orders that have been sought simply because they are consent orders without satisfying myself that the Tribunal in fact erred in law and the correct tariff classification of the goods is under subheading 3808.10.90. Further if I were to be so satisfied, I also consider that I should identify the error of law by the Tribunal which founds the orders I am asked to make.</sentence>
