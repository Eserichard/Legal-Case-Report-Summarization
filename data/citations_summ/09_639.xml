<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1084">Indeed, Ms Chaloner produced evidence that she was suffering severe depression as well as anxiety attacks arising from her concerns about giving evidence in the proceedings. I reject the applicant's submission that her medical condition was "pure poppycock". However as my ruling earlier in these proceedings demonstrated ( Horizontal Falls Adventure Tours Pty Ltd (ACN 108 455 410) v Thomas [2009] FCA 639) I was of the view that, despite these medical conditions, Ms Chaloner would be able to answer questions under cross-examination, and indeed she did so in a direct, detailed and honest manner. </sentence>
