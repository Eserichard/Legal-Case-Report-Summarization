<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1263">10 Notwithstanding the deficiency in the content of the Notice of Appeal , it nevertheless remains clear that the Appellant sought to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of this Court and not its original jurisdiction. Whatever other deficiencies there may be in his Notice of Appeal , that Notice does state (without alteration) that " the appellant appeals from the whole of the judgment of the Federal Magistrate Court given on 18.6.2008 at Sydney ". In some circumstances, it may be accepted, it is not appropriate for this Court to deal with an application before it solely upon the basis of " procedural errors committed by an unrepresented applicant ": eg, Thang Gia Uy Vo v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1599 at [12] , [2007] FCA 1599 ; 101 ALD 57 at 59. </sentence>
