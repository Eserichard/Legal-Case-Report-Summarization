<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1791">15 In The Raphaela S [2005] UKPC 49 ; [2005] 2 AC 423 the House of Lords held that a straight bill of lading required delivery of the cargo by the master in the same way as a negotiable bill. As Lord Bingham said ( The Raphaela S [2005] 2 AC at 444G-H [6]; see too at 457-458 [45] per Lord Steyn; see also my judgment in Hilditch Pty Ltd v Dorval Dauin KK (No 2) [2007] FCA 2014 ; (2007) 245 ALR 125 at 133 [25] - [31] ):
 "... the shipper will not wish to part with an original bill to the consignee or buyer until that party has paid, and requiring production of the bill to obtain delivery is the most effective way of ensuring that a consignee or buyer who has not paid cannot obtain delivery. In this case, therefore, as in the case of an order bill, the bill is 'a key which in the hands of a rightful owner is intended to unlock the door of the warehouse, floating or fixed, in which the goods may chance to be': Sanders Bros v Maclean &amp; Co 11 QBD 327 , 341, per Bowen LJ.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 810">From this sum I will deduct $32,000, the amount which I have found fairly reflects the benefit obtained by Hoy Mobile over the period in which it was committing the fraud. That leaves a net sum of $43,169.75 in damages. Interest will need to be added to this sum at the pre-judgment rates of interest used by the Supreme Court of New South Wales: cf Hilditch Pty Ltd v Dorval Kaiun KK (No 2) [2007] FCA 2014 at [110] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 400">32 The usual practice of the court when awarding interest under s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act is to adopt the rates of interest applied by the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the Court is sitting: Hilditch Pty Ltd v Dorval Kaiun KK (No 2) [2007] FCA 2014 at [110] . There I found that that rate in New South Wales on and from 1 January 2007 is 10%. I followed the decision of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Kalls Enterprises Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Baloglow (No 3) [2007] NSWCA 298 at [22] per Giles, Ipp and Basten JJA.</sentence>
