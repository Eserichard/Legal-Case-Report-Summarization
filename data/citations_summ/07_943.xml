<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 451">Counsel for the applicants also submitted that the textual and policy considerations which underlie O.29 r.5 bear a close resemblance to those which apply to O.6 r.2, which provides for joinder of parties where " some common question of law or of fact would arise in all the proceedings " and " all rights to relief claimed in the proceeding are in respect of or arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions " or " where the Court gives leave so to do " (see Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Limited v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Limited [2007] FCA 943 at [25] per Jacobson J citing Trade Practices Commission v Westco Motors (Distributors) Pty Ltd [1981] FCA 48 ; (1981) 58 FLR 384). It was contended that the interests of justice were not limited to the interests of the parties to proceedings (see BHP Billiton Limited v Schultz and Others (2004) 221 CLR 400 ; [2004] HCA 61 at [15] --- [16] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Heydon JJ) but included, relevantly, the proper and efficient use of the court's time and resources. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 457">In Re Ling this was said to confer a broad discretion on the court to make orders for consolidation " where it is in the interests of justice so to do" (at 134; [18]). Hill J suggested that it was relevant to have regard to " the desirability of avoiding multiple actions, the saving of time and expense and whether the parties would be prejudiced by such a course " and that there was no reason to interpret the rule so that consolidation was confined to cases involving several actions that could have been joined in the one writ. Counsel for the applicants also submitted that the textual and policy considerations which underlie O.29 r.5 bear a close resemblance to those which apply to O.6 r.2, which provides for joinder of parties where " some common question of law or of fact would arise in all the proceedings " and " all rights to relief claimed in the proceeding are in respect of or arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions " or " where the Court gives leave so to do " (see Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Limited v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Limited [2007] FCA 943 at [25] per Jacobson J citing Trade Practices Commission v Westco Motors (Distributors) Pty Ltd (1981) 58 FLR 384 ; [1981] FCA 48). It was contended that the interests of justice were not limited to the interests of the parties to proceedings (see BHP Billiton Limited v Schultz and Others (2004) 221 CLR 400 ; [2004] HCA 61 at [15] --- [16] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Heydon JJ) but included, relevantly, the proper and efficient use of the court's time and resources. The applicants also suggested that there was " commonality " in the Wylie and Davidson matters, in that the first respondent in each matter was the same entity, and in Davidson No.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 277">In my view costs ought only to be ordered from the date of consolidation. This is because it is clear to me from what I said in paragraph 32 of my judgment on 15 June 2007, see Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Limited v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Limited [2007] FCA 943 , that the Global proceeding was overtaken by the consolidated proceeding and the Aristrocrat companies failed on the Play King transaction (that is, the 32 shipments referred to in that paragraph of my earlier judgment). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] NSWSC 110">28 Modern courts do not confine the power to order consolidation or joint hearing to cases where there several actions have been brought which could have been joined in a single writ: see, for example, Re Ling; Ex parte Ling v Commonwealth [1995] FCA 1410 ; (1995) 58 FCR 129 , at 134 per Hill J; Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Limited v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Limited [2007] FCA 943 , at [25] per Jacobson J. It is not necessary that the parties in the separate proceedings be the same parties: Horwood v British Statesman Publishing Co Ltd [1929] WN 38 (where two persons who claimed to have been defamed by the same New Statesman article brought separate proceedings for libel, which were then consolidated). The fact that a plaintiff in one set of proceedings is a defendant in another does not preclude an order for consolidation or, a fortiori , joint hearing: A Goninan &amp; Co Ltd v Atlas Steel (Aust) Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 956 , at [36]-[37]. 26 In my view a useful description of the correct judicial approach to an application under r 28.5 was given by Wolff J (as he then was) in Cousins v Cousins (1948) 51 WALR 57 , at 60:
 
 
 "In my opinion, consolidation is desirable and should be allowed where, as here, the issues are substantially the same, and the evidence is to all intents and purposes identical. I would, however, hesitate to lay down any inflexible rule. Consolidation is intended to save time and expense, as well as to avoid the awkward consequences of contrary findings on the same set of facts. Because it cannot be shown to have been done before in a like instance, it does not follow that the course of procedure which was ordered is not a proper one. "
