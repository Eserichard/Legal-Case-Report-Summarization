<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 78">Similarly, to the extent that the Tribunal expressed scepticism about a particular aspect of the applicant's claims it is not, in the circumstances of this case, apparent that this was done in a manner which evinced a determination only to prove the falsity of the applicant's claims (see SZLUD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 549). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1371">The appellant relied on much the same points in support of her alternative contention that the Tribunal's decision was illogical and irrational, and based on unwarranted assumptions. It is unnecessary to decide, whether, if made out, this contention might have supported some 'unreasonableness' ground: compare NACB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 235 at [29] and SZLUD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 549 at [66] - [67] per McKerracher J, citing Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 at [38] per Gummow and Hayne JJ. For the reasons already stated, the Tribunal's decision did not disclose any material illogicality or irrationality, and was not relevantly based on an unwarranted assumption. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1116">I am not persuaded that there was a complete absence of logical nexus between the evidence before the Tribunal, being the inability of the Applicant to estimate the size or population of Napumpum, and the Tribunal's finding that the Applicant lacked knowledge of basic facts about Napumpum and therefore that the incident described by the Applicant did not take place and no report of any such incident was written by the Applicant (see SZLUD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 549 at [66]).

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1177">More generally in relation to apprehended bias, I note that insofar as issue might be taken with the fact that the Tribunal raised with the applicant issues of concern, either at the hearing or in the s.424A letter, this is not such as to give rise to an apprehension of bias, see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v MZXPA and Another (2008) 100 ALD 312 ; [2008] FCA 185. To the extent that the Tribunal (during the hearing or in the s.424A letter) may have been seen to express scepticism about any aspect of the applicant's claims, it has not been established that it did so in a manner which evinced a determination to prove the falsity of the applicant's claims (see SZLUD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 549) or that was indicative of apprehended bias. </sentence>
