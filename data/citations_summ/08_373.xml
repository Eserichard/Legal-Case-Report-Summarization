<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 796">But ordinarily, I reiterate, the application ought to be made promptly in order to avoid the very situation which has developed in this case. 
 

 
The primary Judge, Helsham J, had there refused to order security and the application for extension of time for seeking leave to appeal from that decision was refused. See also: Readymix Holdings International Pte Ltd v Wieland Process Equipment Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 373. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 492">
 


 
 
 (5) The mere fact of overseas residency, even when coupled with the absence of assets within Australia, is not determinative of the application, but it is nevertheless a factor of some weight: Ezzo v Grille (surpa) at [39]). 
 


 
 
 (6) It has been the practice of the Federal Court and other superior courts to order a plaintiff who is ordinarily resident outside the jurisdiction to provide security unless that party can point to other factors which overcome the weight of the circumstances that the person is resident out of and has no assets within the jurisdiction. See Readymix Holdings International Pty Limited v Wyeland Process Equipment Pty Limited [2008] FCA 373 per Flick J at [12] and the authorities to which his Honour refers. </sentence>
