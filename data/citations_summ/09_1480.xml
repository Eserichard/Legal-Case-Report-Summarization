<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] SASCFC 59">There has been much consideration of Aon in later decisions, both at the interlocutory single judge level and at the intermediate court level. There have been in the order of 200 published judgments where Aon has influenced the decision. Although not all of those involve applications to amend pleadings, a substantial number do. In those proceedings, the circumstances surrounding the applications to amend are varied. Unsurprisingly, different results have ensued. Applications to amend raising points of substance, prior to the setting of a date for trial, have almost always without exception, [105] been allowed. [106] Appropriate orders to address prejudice have been made. [107] Applications to amend at or immediately prior to or during trial have often been refused, [108] however, even very late applications to amend have been allowed. [109] </sentence>
