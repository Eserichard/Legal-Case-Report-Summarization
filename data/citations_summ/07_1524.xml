<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 851">In support of the Application the Applicant has filed an Affidavit which annexes a Draft Notice of Appeal . But that Affidavit fails to comply with r 4(2). It is in inadmissible form but, more relevantly, it is more in the nature of a submission and challenges the factual conclusions made by the Refugee Review Tribunal which affirmed the decision not to grant a protection visa. But such deficiencies may presently be left to one side. Non-compliance with r 4(2) should not, as in other proceedings where an applicant has been unrepresented (e.g. Lawrance v The Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1524 at [26] ; Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1593 at [6] ), of itself necessarily impede a proper consideration of such merits as an application may present. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1340">2. The Court's jurisdiction in discrimination matters is confined by s.46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) to the ambit of a complaint which was terminated by the President of the Commission, and to the respondents to the complaint. In the present matter, I decided at an interlocutory stage that Ms Lawrance's application did not encompass complaints against persons other than the present respondents, nor against government agencies except to the extent that the conduct of the personal respondents in 2005 and 2006 was alleged to have evidenced and formed part of a programme or policy directed at her by Commonwealth and State agencies (see: Lawrance v Commonwealth of Australia &amp; Ors (No.1) [2006] FMCA 1792 , Lawrance v Commonwealth of Australia &amp; Ors (No.2) [2007] FMCA 797 , Lawrance v Commonwealth of Australia &amp; Ors (No.3) [2007] FMCA 806 , Lawrance v Commonwealth of Australia &amp; Ors (No.4) [2007] FMCA 1408 , and Lawrance v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1524). These rulings governed the evidence which I admitted at the hearing of the application. I have considered Ms Lawrance's additional written submissions on my rulings, but have not been persuaded that they were wrong, nor that I should give further reasons for my conclusions as to the ambit of the application or on the other matters which I addressed in my interlocutory judgments.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 417">28 Some of these grounds, although not all, it should be noted, have been previously considered in this Court. Thus in Lawrance v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 1524 leave to appeal was sought in respect to a refusal to join the Guardianship Tribunal and to challenge rulings as to the admissibility of evidence. Leave to appeal was refused. In refusing leave, Buchanan J conducted a detailed review of the proceedings to date and concluded in part as follows:
 
 [2] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] NSWCA 13">26 The only basis upon which this Court might properly not apply the principle set out in Ex parte Armstrong would be because it was concerned with the exercise of judicial power under Chapter III of the Constitution . There is authority for the proposition that such an order will not arise unless it is "decisive of the rights of the parties": see Yule v Junek [1978] HCA 4 ; (1978) 139 CLR 1 at 14 (Mason J) and see Mellifont v Attorney-General (Queensland) [1991] HCA 53 ; (1991) 173 CLR 289 at 300 and the authorities at fn (30) (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ). A broader view might be taken of the nature of a curial order, where it affects the constitution of the relevant tribunal under a State law, but there is no support for that view in the authorities: see Moller v Roy [1975] HCA 31 ; (1975) 132 CLR 622 at 639 (Mason J); Ah Toy v Registrar of Companies (1985) 10 FCR 280 at 285-286 (Toohey, Morling and Wilcox JJ). There are many kinds of interlocutory rulings which are not appealable judgments or orders: see The Commonwealth v Mullane [1961] HCA 28 ; (1961) 106 CLR 166 at 169. A ruling that evidence is admissible is not appealable: see generally Bozatsis &amp; Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 at 303 (Gleeson CJ, Meagher JA and Bruce J agreeing); Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Company (Canberra) Ltd (NSWCA 20 May 1996, unreported) (Mahoney P, Meagher and Cole JJA agreeing) applied by Buchanan J in Lawrance v The Commonwealth [2007] FCA 1524: indeed in Hall v Braybrook [1956] HCA 30 ; (1956) 95 CLR 620 at 635, Dixon CJ said that "a magistrate's ruling that evidence is to be admitted or rejected cannot itself constitute an 'order' that may be reviewed ... though of course if erroneous it may be a ground for reviewing a determination affected by it". See also Legal Practitioners' Complaints Committee v A Practitioner (1987) 46 SASR 126 at 127 (King CJ) applied by Spigelman CJ in Johnston v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 17; (2005) 62 NSWLR 309 at [30], and see Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2005] NSWCA 233 ; (2005) 54 ACSR 365 at [6] and at [21]-[25]. No argument having been addressed to these matters, they need not be taken further.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 1934">The Court's jurisdiction in discrimination matters is confined by s.46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) to the ambit of a complaint which was terminated by the President of the Commission, and to the respondents to the complaint. In the present matter, I decided at an interlocutory stage that Ms Lawrance's application did not encompass complaints against persons other than the present respondents, nor against government agencies except to the extent that the conduct of the personal respondents in 2005 and 2006 was alleged to have evidenced and formed part of a programme or policy directed at her by Commonwealth and State agencies (see: Lawrance v Commonwealth of Australia &amp; Ors (No.1) [2006] FMCA 1792 , Lawrance v Commonwealth of Australia &amp; Ors (No.2) [2007] FMCA 797 , Lawrance v Commonwealth of Australia &amp; Ors (No.3) [2007] FMCA 806 , Lawrance v Commonwealth of Australia &amp; Ors (No.4) [2007] FMCA 1408 , and Lawrance v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 1524). These rulings governed the evidence which I admitted at the hearing of the application. I have considered Ms Lawrance's additional written submissions on my rulings, but have not been persuaded that they were wrong, nor that I should give further reasons for my conclusions as to the ambit of the application or on the other matters which I addressed in my interlocutory judgments. </sentence>
