<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1772">19 That may have been the " impression " of the now Appellant at the time. But there was no obligation imposed upon the Tribunal to raise with him whatever reservations may have been experienced at the time as to the explanations being provided by the now Appellant, let alone any obligation to raise whatever reservations may subsequently have emerged when the evidence in its entirety was being considered and the reasons being drafted. As was recognised by Lord Diplock in F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 at 369:
 ... the rules of natural justice do not require the decision-maker to disclose what he is minded to decide so that the parties may have a further opportunity of criticising his mental processes before he reaches a final decision. If this were a rule of natural justice only the most talkative of judges would satisfy it and trial by jury would have to be abolished. And, after having cited these observations, in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 , 228 CLR 152 at 166 Gleeson CJ, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ further observed:
 [48] ... Procedural fairness does not require the Tribunal to give an applicant a running commentary upon what it thinks about the evidence that is given. On the contrary, to adopt such a course would be likely to run a serious risk of conveying an impression of prejudgment. See also: SZHBP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1299 at [11] , [2008] FCA 1299 ; 103 ALD 595 at 597.</sentence>
