<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 914">It was submitted that it was relevant to have regard to the authorities on the question of whether a Tribunal would commit legal error by not considering an issue, even if it was not raised or the subject of challenge by the parties to the proceedings before the Tribunal. In Repatriation Commission v Warren (2008) 167 FCR 511 ; [2008] FCAFC 64 at [78] , Lindgren and Bennett JJ referred to the principle that the court would more readily permit a matter to be raised for the first time on appeal from a Tribunal where the matter was a pure question of law or where: ... the matter goes to a misapprehension that was shared by the parties before the tribunal and therefore by the tribunal itself ... such as a shared misapprehension as to the applicable law.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1328">The Federal Magistrate found error in the Tribunal's treatment of the "main business" in which the appellant claimed to have an "ownership interest". The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal did not ask itself whether, as the appellants claimed, the main business was the business carried on by REI and Multi in that the business in which those two entitles were involved was the same. Instead the Tribunal incorrectly distinguished the decisions in Nassif v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affaird (2003) 129 FCR 448 ; [2003] FCA 481 and Liang v Minister for Immigration (2009) 157 FCR 184 ; [2009] FCA 189 and, in so doing, took into account irrelevant considerations in respect of the characterisation of the main business, being that: - (i) Multi did not exist when the visa applications were made (at [25]), (ii) the first appellant's motivation in ceasing trading through REI and continuing trading through Multi (at [28]), (iii) the first appellant was not a shareholder in Multi (at [28]), and (iv) REI and Multi were separate legal entities (at [30]). The Federal Magistrate concluded that the Tribunal had taken into account these considerations irrelevant to the question about the "main business" because it had conflated that issue with the "ownership interest" issue (at [28] and [30]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 891">Counsel for the applicants submitted first that Mr Lu's case as presented to the Tribunal was that he had established an integrated business whereby G Ping conducted research into Australian goods suitable for export to Taiwan, acquired those goods and had them shipped to Jason Tech for display and sale at Jason Tech's showroom in Taiwan. It was submitted that if the commercial activities underlying these claims were established, there could be no doubt that a business as described by Mason J in Hope at 8 --- 9 would exist, or that such a business would be an " eligible business" as defined in s.134(1) of the Migration Act . Reference was made to the fact that Logan J stated in Liang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2009] FCA 189 ; (2009) 175 FCR 184 at [30] that the word " business ", as used in terms " main business" and " qualifying business" in the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth), was used in the sense of " enterprise . " A similar meaning was said to be applicable to the word " business" in s.134 of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 593">The applicant contends that the Tribunal erred in taking an incorrect approach to determine whether the two companies with which the principal applicant was concerned were carrying on the same business. The applicant contends that the Tribunal incorrectly attempted to distinguish the case before it from that from those dealt with the Federal Court in Nassif v Minister for Immigration [7] and Tung-Liang Liang v Minister for Immigration [8] . The applicant submits that it is apparent from those decisions that the Tribunal needed to direct its attention to the nature of the business conducted rather than the legal structure through which the business was carried on. The applicant also contends that it was irrelevant to the proper approach to be followed that the second company was not in existence at the time of the visa application. The applicant contends that the Tribunal asked the wrong question.  The Tribunal held that the First Applicant satisfied the requirements of cl.845.213 at the time of the visa application: paragraph [38]. However, it held that for the First Applicant to continue to satisfy clause 845.213 at the time of the Tribunal's decision in accordance with clause 845.221, he must continue to have an interest in the same main business in which he had an ownership interest at the time of the visa application. This statutory construction was in accordance with what Logan J held to be the correct construction of cl.845.213(b) in Tung-Liang Liang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 189 ; (2009) 107 ALD 88 at [54] - [55]. The Tribunal made detailed reference to that decision in its findings and reasons: paragraph [40]. Its interpretation of Logan J's decision was correct. The Tribunal has given consideration to whether the main business at the time of decision must be the same main business as that nominated at the time of application. However, the Tribunal is of the view that the nominated business or businesses are intended to be the same business or businesses that the application should be assessed against at the time of decision. The Tribunal has been guided by the recent decision of the Federal Court: Tung-Liang Liang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citzenship [2009] FCA 189. This judgement confirms that the use of the phrase "of that kind" in subclause 845.213(b) makes the interest that the applicant must continue to have, the same interest that the applicant had for the purpose of meeting the requirements of subclause 845.213(a). In considering the meaning of "continues to" in cl.845.221 the Court concludes [at 55] that the continued interest must be 'of that kind' that is, a reference to the 'main business' or businesses referred to in cl.845.213(a) and (b).</sentence>
