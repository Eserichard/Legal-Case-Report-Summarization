<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 408">The Minister also makes reference to a number of authorities as to the nature of further evidence that may be received after judgment has been reserved ( Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Ltd (No.2) [2008] FCA 1761 at [12] --- [15], Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Lee v Professional Services Review Committee No 292 (No 2) [2010] FCA 1490 at [2] , BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 389 at [10] , McLaughlin v Dungowan Manly Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 89 at [45] --- [56], Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1490">In Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1761 Collier J found herself in a similar position to me in that she had reserved judgment in proceedings, after which one of the parties or some of the parties sought leave to adduce further evidence. The proceedings before her Honour concerned an issue relating to the infringement or the alleged infringement of the applicant's registered trademark and alleged misleading and deceptive conduct and matters of that kind. On the question of the principles governing the question of whether or not leave to reopen should be granted, her Honour said: It is not in dispute that the Court has the power to grant leave for further evidence-in-chief to be adduced after the trial of the proceeding has concluded and judgment reserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 601">It is well established that the court does have such jurisdiction (see for example Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , in which Kenny J set out the circumstances in which the court will permit further evidence to be adduced and Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Ltd (No.2) [2008] FCA 1761). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1869">1 On 25 November 2008 I gave judgment in the primary proceedings in this matter ( Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 1) [2008] FCA 1760) and also in relation to a notice of motion filed 16 May 2008 ( Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 1761). In summary, I found that the conduct of the first and second respondents had infringed the applicant's registered trade mark, but that the effect of compliance with an oral undertaking given by the first respondent during the hearing of the primary proceedings was that the infringement of the applicant's registered trade mark by the respondents ceased. Notwithstanding that undertaking however, I allowed the application in part because I considered that the applicant was entitled to an injunction based upon the oral undertaking. Upon giving judgment I directed the parties to make submissions as to the terms of the injunction in light of the reasons given in my judgment. I also directed that the parties make submissions as to costs. 10 The applicant submitted that, as the notice of motion was dismissed ( Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 1761) , there was no reason why the normal rule should not apply, and that costs should follow the event. The respondents made no submissions specifically referable to this notice of motion.</sentence>
