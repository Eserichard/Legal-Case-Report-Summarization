<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VSC 489">The represented group in the proceeding was confined to group members who had entered a litigation funding agreement with a litigation funder. It was this limitation that prompted an application to the trial judge, Finkelstein J, and then to the Full Federal Court, seeking to have the proceeding struck out, primarily on the basis that the restriction of the group membership ran contrary to the purpose and intent of Part IVA of the Federal Court Act. Both Finkelstein J [26] at first instance and the Full Federal Court [27] (French, Lindgren and Jacobson JJ) held that it was permissible to limit the group in this way. 34 Before turning to the decision of Finkelstein J, the point to be noted in the Multiplex litigation in relation to discovery of group members, is that this group of shareholders was particularly confined, with each member being readily identifiable by reason of the existence of agreements with the litigation funder --- a discrete identifiable class of 109 purchasers of securities issued by the Multiplex companies. [28] 
35 In Multiplex (No 2), Multiplex sought an order that the investors which comprised the limited group make discovery of litigation funding agreements and trade information relevant to the quantum of their claims.</sentence>

45 His Honour went on to note that there had been criticism of the judgment of Stone J in Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Ltd [2005] FCA 1483 ; (2005) 147 FCR 394 , including in a judgment of Justice Finkelstein in P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd [2007] FCA 1061 ; (2007) 242 ALR 111. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] NSWSC 639">16 It may also be noted that the pleaded case does not appear to deal explicitly with the matter of reliance by the plaintiff on the faulty information and the causal link between that information and his loss or damage. Rather, there seems to be intended resort to a presumption of reliance generated by a duty to keep the market properly informed. This was referred to by Finkelstein J in P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd [2007] FCA 1061 ; (2007) 242 ALR 111 at [11] as follows:
 

 
 
 "It may also be argued that there is a rebuttable presumption of reliance (if it is necessary to establish reliance) on the existence of an open and efficient market for Multiplex securities. In the United States this is referred to as the fraud-on-the-market theory. In Basic Inc v Levinson (1988) 485 US 224 the Supreme Court of the United States held that securities class action plaintiffs are entitled to a presumption of reliance that the market for the securities in question was efficient and that the plaintiffs traded in reliance on the integrity of the market price for those securities.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCAFC 200">63 The learned primary judge stated that the regime created by s 33N(1) involves two steps. First, the Court must decide whether one of the conditions stated in s 33N(1)(a) to (d) has been satisfied. Second, if it has, then, and only then, the Court is to consider whether it is in the interests of justice to make an order of discontinuance because of the existence of the condition: see P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd [2007] FCA 1061 at [21] . He referred to the decision of the Full Court in Bright v Femcare as authority for that proposition, citing in particular the reasons of Lindgren J and Finkelstein J's own reasons for judgment in that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] NSWSC 1437">14 In a proceeding under s 33C in P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd [2007] FCA 1061 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1192 , 1195 [14], Finkelstein J said that three matters need to be shown for a valid class action viz: (1) numerosity; (2) connectivity; and (3) commonality. That is, (1) there must be numerous persons with claims against the same defendant; (2) those claims arise out of the same or similar circumstances; and (3) there is a substantial common issue of law or fact. </sentence>
