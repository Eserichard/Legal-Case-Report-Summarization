<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 43">It may be that the present submission is intended to distinguish between a purpose of preventing a particular imminent departure from Australia and a more general prevention of any departure from Australia. In my view even the latter is within para (b) of s 72D(1). That is to say, that paragraph is satisfied if the Registrar believes on reasonable grounds that it is "desirable" to make the DPO for the purpose of "ensuring" (a strong word: see Troughton v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 18 ; (2008) 166 FCR 9 at [20] ) that the person does not depart at any time in the future from Australia for any foreign country without first discharging the child support liability or making arrangements satisfactory to the Registrar for its discharge. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 626">Counsel for Mr Lui also relied on observations by Jessup J in Troughton v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 18 ; (2008) 166 FCR 9 at [24] to support the construction offered. Jessup J there said: 
 "The next provision to which reference should be made is s 14U. Here the legislature has turned its mind to the kind of exceptional circumstances that might arise, in which the non-achievement of the purpose referred to in s 14S(1) might be tolerated.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1590">92 Having reflected on the language employed in s 14S(1)(b) of the TAA and on what was said of that provision by Young J in Dalco v Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 19 ATR 443 at 447-448 (later endorsed by Einfeld J in Edelsten v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 85 ALR 226 at 230) and by Pincus J (as his Honour then was) in Skase v Commissioner of Taxation [1991] FCA 226 ; (1991) 32 FCR 206 , at 209 and 211, Jessup J in Troughton v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 18 ; (2008) 166 FCR 9 at 17, [22] --- [23] recently offered the following summary of how that provision falls to be construed:
 
 
 22 It follows that s 14S(1)(b) should be read not literally, but as though it referred to a belief by the Commissioner (on reasonable grounds) that it was desirable that the person not leave Australia without discharging the tax liability or making the arrangements there referred to. Thus it is not to be taken as a given that, in every case, the departure of the person from Australia will make it unlikely, or at least less likely, that the tax liability will be discharged, or that the ability of the Commissioner to recover the tax will be impaired. These are things which must be considered by the Commissioner in every case. The purpose of s 14S, and accordingly a central purpose of Part IVA , is not the prevention of persons (owing tax) from leaving Australia simpliciter: it is the prevention of such persons from leaving Australia where, in the Commissioner's belief reasonably arrived at, the recovery of tax would or might thereby be impaired. 23 In that result, at least so far as revealed by s 14S, the general scope and objects of Part IVA of the Administration Act are as contended for by both sides in the present case. As contended for by the Commissioner, they are the protection of the revenue. As contended for by the applicant, they are the prevention of persons (owing tax) from leaving Australia where that would affect the recoverability thereof. </sentence>
