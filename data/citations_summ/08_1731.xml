<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1039">Before me today the applicant said that when he and his wife were interviewed by the Tribunal they were interviewed separately. It transpired that what he meant was that although they came into the Tribunal together they were separated when they were giving evidence. Provided the Tribunal ensures that each applicant is aware of the evidence given by the other, and any inconsistencies arising therefrom, there is no breach of s.425 in dealing with a hearing in this way, per Jagot J, SZJZB &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1731 at [7] . There is no breach of any other of the requirements for procedural fairness set out in division 4 of the Act provided a letter under s.424A is sent to the parties setting out the required matters and this was done on 11 March 2009 [CB 156]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 537">The principle arising in SZBYR that inconsistencies, and the Tribunal's reasoning, does not comprise 'information' within the meaning of s 424A(1) , has been followed by this Court regardless of the specific nature of the doubts, inconsistencies or deficiencies in evidence that led the Tribunal to reach an adverse credibility finding. The reason the High Court in SZBYR excluded such things from the definition of 'information' in s 424A(1) was not based on the inconsistencies which the Tribunal relied upon to form an opinion on credibility in the appeal before it, but rather upon an awareness of the problems which would arise if adverse credibility findings and the Tribunal's reasoning could be said to constitute 'information'. As the High Court said at [18]: 
 ...if the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but each step in its reasoning process. 

Recent decisions of this Court have adopted such principle: see SZLKY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1755 at [30] and SZJZB and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 1731 ; (2008) 105 ALD 226 at [18] . The appellants' attempt to distinguish the circumstances in the current appeal from those in SZBYR is to demonstrate a misconception of the High Court's reasoning and is rejected. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 363">In SZJZB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1731 , Jagot J specifically considered Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 , which considered a disavowal. Jagot J said, at [25], that VEAL was not an answer in SZJZB , as VEAL was decided before SZBYR, and, more importantly, the parties in VEAL effectively conceded that s.424A had no application in VEAL . Ultimately, Jagot J held that "disavowal of reliance on the information is itself potentially ambiguous rather than determinative of the issue given the terms of 
 s 424A. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 333">Counsel for the first respondent contended that there were two decisions of the Federal Court relevant to this issue that were " irreconcilable ". The first of those decisions is the 3 November 2008 decision of Perram J in SZLPJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1721. The second is the 19 November 2008 decision of Jagot J in SZJZB and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 1731 ; (2008) 105 ALD 226 (on appeal from my decision in SZJZB &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 848). Their Honours were each exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 209">Here, the information given by Ms L to the tribunal did not merely undermine the credibility of the appellant. It went to the heart of the relationship which was the foundation of his claim to a protection visa: see also MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 at 492 [27] per Heerey J; SZJZB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1731 ; [2008] 105 ALD 226 at 234 [22] - [25] per Jagot J. The information from Ms L undermined the appellant's claim, for the tribunal said it brought into question the level of communication between the two of them and, ultimately, but directly led to its conclusions that the relationship was not as he had claimed and his desire to remain in Australia was stronger than his desire to live with her and their child. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 99">The decision of Heerey J in MZXBQ is distinguishable, because it appears, from [6] and [12] of his Honour's reasons, that the information in question was referred to in the course of the Tribunal hearing, even though there was no reference to it in the section 424A letter or the Tribunal's reasons. Jagot J followed MZXBQ in SZJZB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1731 ; (2008) 105 ALD 226 , so too did Siopis J in SZMFZ , but both of those cases are distinguishable from the present matter upon the basis that the information in question was considered in those cases to be relevant by the Tribunal, either explicitly or by inference from the review process. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 24">It is accepted that the evidence was put to him so that s.425 of the Migration Act 1958 (the "Act") was satisfied; SZJZB &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1731 at [7].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 1715">As suggested in SZBYR (at [17]), the use in s.424A(1) of the future conditional tense suggests that the operation of the section is to be determined in advance and independently of the Tribunal's particular reasoning and at a time when the Tribunal becomes aware of the information. Even if the Tribunal had disavowed reliance on this information that would not be determinative (see SZJZB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1731 at [25] per Jagot J). In fact it did not do so, but rather referred expressly to information received in response to its " inquiries ". The fact that the photograph in the business visa application did not appear to be of the applicant " undermined " the applicant's claims in so far as the Tribunal found its inability to be satisfied as to his identity important not only to his credibility but also to its finding that it was " unsatisfied as to what his situation was in China " which was part of its reason for not being satisfied that he was a practising Christian member of a local church in China as claimed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 1686">However the Tribunal has stated that it did not use the information that the applicant provided orally to the Department. There is no evidence before the Court as to the evidence that the applicant gave in such an interview, except insofar as the delegate referred to such matters in the delegate's reasons for decision. In SZJZB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1731 Jagot J stated (at [25]) that: ... insofar as the Tribunal's reasons are relevant to the present task, disavowal of reliance on the information is itself potentially ambiguous rather than determinative of the issue given the terms of s 424A . 
As was suggested in SZBYR at [17] the use in s.424A(1) of the future conditional tense rather than the indicative suggests that the operation of the section is to be determined in advance and independently of the Tribunal's particular reasoning. In SZJZB Jagot J pointed out (at [22]) that:
 
 It is for this reason that the focus of the inquiry must be the provision under which the protection visa was sought (s 36) and whether the information contains any "rejection, denial or undermining of the appellants' claims to be persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations".</sentence>
