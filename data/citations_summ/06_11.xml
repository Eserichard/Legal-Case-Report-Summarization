<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 2084">As noted above on the evidence before the Court it was not possible to establish what the common understanding of the parties was at the time of the Agreement. As to events since both the prior iterations of Appendix D and the Agreement itself it appears as Gray ACJ said in Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union v Prestige Property Service Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 11 at 44 " [T] here can be no meeting of minds, no consensus, if no-one has thought about the issue . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 616">31 Counsel for the applicant contended that the past conduct of the parties could be relied upon as an aid in the construction of the Certified Agreement. There is authority that, if a provision has appeared in a series of agreements between the same parties, and if they can be shown to have conducted themselves according to a common understanding of the meaning of that provision, then it can be taken that they have agreed that the term should continue to have the commonly understood meaning in the current agreement. See Merchant Service Guild of Australia v Sydney Steam Collier Owners &amp; Coal Stevedores Association (1958) 1 FLR 248 at 251 per Spicer CJ, 254 per Dunphy J and 257 per Morgan J, and Printing &amp; Kindred Industries Union v Davies Bros Ltd (1986) 18 IR 444 at 452-453. It is necessary to take great care in the application of this limited principle, to avoid infringing the general principle that the conduct of parties to an agreement cannot be taken into account in construing the agreement. For the limited principle to operate, there must be clear evidence that the parties have acted upon a common understanding as to the meaning of the relevant provision and not for other reasons, such as common inadvertence as to its true meaning.
