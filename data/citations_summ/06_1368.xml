 This is an appeal against sentence. Whether legislation operates to create a pre-condition in such a way is a question of construction. In Woolworths Ltd v Pallas Newco Pty Ltd [30] Spigelman CJ observed: 
 
 The issue is one of statutory construction. What is required is a careful analysis of the statute which confers the jurisdiction. Consideration must be given to the language of the power under consideration and to the total context of the legislative scheme in which the power is conferred, including the scope and nature of the jurisdiction and of the fact said to be jurisdictional.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1537">That section limits the Court's jurisdiction in migration matters to those set out in s 476A(1) ; see Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception &amp; Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 155 FCR 465 at [51] ---[52] per Besanko J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCAFC 55">In the case of a person undergoing a temporary but acute phase of a mental disease or disorder it might be assessed that the security risk associated with his travel and the cost of providing a suitable escort at a particular time would render it not "reasonably practicable" to remove him at that time. This would be an essentially evaluative decision on which different minds might come to different conclusions consistently with the requirements of the legislation. French J said (at 676-677 [84]-[85]) there is nothing in any of the propositions which he set out which was inconsistent with the High Court's decision in Al-Kateb v Godwin [2004] HCA 37 ; (2004) 219 CLR 562 (see also the discussion in Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 155 FCR 465 at 475-477 [40] - [44]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 1734">In the circumstances the continued detention of the applicant is thus a privative clause decision over which this court has jurisdiction: Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 155 FCR 465. A privative clause decision can only be set aside in circumstances of jurisdictional error: s.474(1) of the Act and Plaintiff S157 of 2002 v Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476. On this approach to the matter the Court must therefore determine whether the applicant's continued detention amounts to conduct affected by jurisdictional error and is thus subject to a finding that it is unlawful, which would ground the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, notwithstanding s.196. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 1524">The matter was listed before Tamberlin J on 9 May 2008, when his Honour made that interim order on 9 May 2008. He later published his reasons on 4 June 2008 (see [The applicant] v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 836). His Honour was referred by the Minister to the judgment of Besanko J in Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception &amp; Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 155 FCR 465 , which limited the Court's jurisdiction to judicially review the removal of non-citizens from Australia. However, he considered that it was reasonably arguable that the reasoning and decision of Besanko J was wrong. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 1099">The opinion required to be formed by the Minister was that the visa holder's removal was "reasonably practicable". The test is directed toward the removal of a person from Australia. Subsection 198(6) requires that an officer of the Department "must remove as soon as reasonably practicable an unlawful non-citizen" if certain conditions are satisfied. An assessment of whether a person's removal is reasonably practicable extends beyond an assessment of merely physical matters affecting their removal to a willingness of a country to accept them ( NATB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [72] ; M38/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [73] ; Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre [74] ).

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1039">15 In response to this, counsel for the Minister relied on the decision of Besanko J in Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 155 FCR 465. In that case, Besanko J decided that the question of "reasonable practicability" under s 198(6) , which question may include an assessment of the relevant non-citizen's physical and/or mental health, is not a jurisdictional fact which conditions the existence of the duty in that provision of the Act . The difficulty for the applicant in that case was that the jurisdictional error was not pleaded in the Statement of Claim because the case proceeded on the assumption that it was sufficient to allege that it was not reasonably practicable, as a matter of fact, to remove the applicant from Australia. His Honour did not consider that was a sufficient ground. On this point, Mr Asaad submits that the present case gives rise to issues different to those canvassed by Besanko J, and that Beyazkilinc [2006] FCA 1368 ; 155 FCR 465 is therefore not determinative in this application. 15 In response to this, counsel for the Minister relied on the decision of Besanko J in Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 155 FCR 465.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 836">12 Counsel for the Minister submits that this Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with the application on the basis that the question of the reasonable practicability of removal is not a jurisdictional fact. Counsel refers to the decision of Besanko J in Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 155 FCR 465 , which involved a decision under s 198(6) of the Act to remove from Australia an unlawful non-citizen in detention who suffered from mental illness. His Honour held that the proposed removal of Mr Beyazkilinc from Australia pursuant to the subsection was a "privative clause decision", as that term is defined in s 474 of the Act . The question of the reasonable practicability of the removal was held by his Honour not to be a jurisdictional fact. Counsel for the Minister says that, applying this ruling in the present case, the Court does not have jurisdiction and therefore the application to restrain the Minister must fail. 13 In the course of his judgment in Beyazkilinc [2006] FCA 1368 ; 155 FCR 465 , Besanko J referred at 475-476 to four relevant factors to be taken into account in determining whether there was an arguable challenge to removal. At 476-477, his Honour noted that, while two of the factors suggested that the question of reasonable practicability should be characterised as a jurisdictional fact, the other two factors spoke strongly against it and outweighed the first two factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] NSWCA 338">
 

20 Whether an appeal against a decision in favour of a company in liquidation may be brought without leave to proceed is unclear. Under s 500 of the Corporations Law leave is required to commence or proceed with any action or civil proceeding against a company in liquidation. As a matter of language, is bringing an appeal proceeding with the first instance action or proceeding for which leave to proceed was given; put in reverse, is the appeal a separate action or proceeding? As a matter of substance, leave to proceed against a company in liquidation on a claim against it may be thought to embrace an appeal following dismissal of the claim; the appeal seeks the result denied to the claimant at first instance. On the other hand, if the claim has failed there may be occasion to consider whether the claimant should be allowed to go further, for example because the appeal lacks merit and significant further costs will be incurred. It may be that the terms of the grant of leave to proceed limit the leave to the first instance proceeding. The cases are inconclusive, see Humber &amp; Co v John Griffiths Cycle Co (1901) 85 LT 141 , BPM Pty Ltd v HPM Pty Ltd (1996) 14 ACLC 857 , Skinner v Jeogla Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 15 and King v Yurisich [2006] FCA 1368 ; [2006] 59 ACSR 598. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FMCA 1945">It was not submitted for the applicant, and in my opinion could not be submitted, that even if the Department officer's action was not referable to an exercise or purported exercise of power under s.417 , this Court's consequential declaratory jurisdiction under s.16 of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth), or associated jurisdiction under s.18 of the Federal Magistrates Act could independently support the competence of the application. Such a submission would be contrary to authority (see Vietnam Veterans' Affairs Association of Australia New South Wales Branch v Cohen &amp; Ors [1996] FCA 981 ; (1996) 70 FCR 419 at 434, Petrotimor Companhia de Petroleos SARL v Commonwealth of Australia &amp; Ors [2003] FCAFC 83 ; (2003) 128 FCR 507 at [18] and [33], and Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre &amp; Anor [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 155 FCR 465 at [54] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FCA 1480">63 Section 75(1) obliges the Minister to decide whether an action is a controlled action and, if it is, which provisions of Part 3 are the controlling provisions. The applicant rightly points out that the language of s 75 requires the Minister to recognise his jurisdiction and that it does not follow that the Minister is to determine the issue subjectively. It is relevant that s 75 contains no reference to the Minister's mental state by the use of words such as "opinion", "belief" or "satisfaction" which often signify that the decision is not a jurisdictional fact. While the presence of such terms would almost invariably indicate that the determination of fact is not jurisdictional (see for instance, Vanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield City Council [1999] NSWCA 6 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 78 at 90-91), their absence is not decisive; see Timbarra at 64. See also Beyazkilinc v Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 155 FCR 465 at 475-8 per Besanko J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FMCA 2162">With respect to the first issue, the matter has been the subject of detailed consideration by Besanko J in Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 155 FCR 465 ; (2006) 236 ALR 99 ; (2006) 97 ALD 68 in the Federal Court. His Honour found that the decision under s.198 was a privative clause decision, and not a jurisdictional fact for the court to determine (see para.39 and following). His Honour, however, noted that it is a matter that can be the subject of judicial review or jurisdictional error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCA 1203">

16 The respondent contended that the detention of the applicant was a privative clause decision because his detention comprised the "doing of an act" under the Act, and so was within the ambit of s 474(3)(g) of the Act. The respondent relied upon the case of Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 155 FCR 465. In that case, Besanko J held that removal of the applicant pursuant to s 198 of the Act was the "doing of an act" and so fell within the ambit of s 474(3)(g), with the consequence that it was to be characterised as a "privative clause decision". The respondent submitted that by parity of reasoning the detention of the applicant under s 189 of the Act was also the "doing of an act" under the Act and, therefore, a privative clause decision and a "migration decision". The respondent went on to submit, in oral submissions, that the claim for damages for false imprisonment amounted to a collateral attack on a migration decision and, therefore, the Federal Court has no original jurisdiction to hear and determine the applicant's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FMCA 867">More recently in Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 Besanko J decided that a decision to remove an unlawful non-citizen from Australia is a privative clause decision within s. 474 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2007] FMCA 716">A third issue --- as to whether the removal under s.198(6) was or would be "reasonably practical" - was also sought to be argued, though the particulars supporting such a contention were never presented. The Amended Application filed on 20 November 2006 appeared to agitate this issue as a discrete ground of jurisdictional error but the particulars of claim filed on the same day were silent on this topic. The "reasonably practical" argument would appear to be bound up with the applicants' collateral challenge argument in relation to s.417. The decision of Besanko J in Beyazkilinc v The Manager, Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 , especially at [40]-[46], would appear to present difficulties to any challenge to a factual reference or determination made as to the reasonably practicality of removal when no allegation of jurisdictional error in relation to that specific decision is made. Besanko J found that the question of reasonably practicality is not a jurisdictional fact. Here, no particulars are provided of any jurisdictional error associated with any conclusion of a part of an immigration officer as to the reasonable practicality of the removal of the applicants. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2007] FMCA 139">But, if the legislature does make the jurisdiction of a court contingent upon the actual existence of a state of facts, as distinguished from the [inferior] court's opinion or determination that the facts do exist, then the validity of the proceedings and orders must always remain an outstanding question until some other court or tribunal, possessing power to determine that question, decides that the requisite state of facts in truth existed and the proceedings of the court were valid. Conceding the abstract possibility of the legislature adopting such a course, nevertheless it produces so inconvenient a result that no enactment dealing with proceedings in any of the ordinary [inferior] courts of justice should receive such an interpretation unless the intention is clearly expressed. " " [p.230]
 
This passage from Parisienne was recently quoted by Besanko J in Beyazkilinc v Manager, Baxter Immigration, Reception and Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368. In that case his Honour set out a number of considerations established by the authorities relevant to a determination of whether a factual reference in a statutory provision is a jurisdictional fact at [41]:
 
 
 "1. If the factual reference (as it is sometimes called) is expressed in terms of the 'opinion', 'belief' or satisfaction' of the primary decision-maker then the factual reference is not a jurisdictional fact, although there will still be a jurisdictional fact, namely, the primary decision-maker's state of mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2006] FCAFC 169">In his reasons the primary judge agreed with the decision in Chu v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2005] FCA 1730 ; (2005) 147 FCR 505 that the judgment as to whether all reasonable steps had been taken for the purposes of s 24A of the FOI Act was not a jurisdictional fact: see also decision of Besanko J on what constitutes a jurisdictional fact in Beyazkilinc v Manager Immigration Reception and Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 at [41] - [45]. </sentence>
