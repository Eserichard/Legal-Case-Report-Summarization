<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 982">4 The primary proceeding in which the appellants were the applicants and AIA the respondent was heard over a period of some 20 days and judgment was given by Cowdroy J on 12 March 2008 dismissing the application: see Yang v American International Insurance Company (Australia) Ltd [2008] FCA 39. Subsequently, on 16 April 2008, his Honour ordered that the costs which the appellants were ordered on 12 March 2008 to pay to AIA be paid on a party-party basis up to 11 September 2007 and from that date on an indemnity basis: see Yang v American International Assurance Company (Australia) Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 493. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 518">31 It is appropriate that Cytel pay the costs of and incidental to the notice of motion. Peoplebank points to the fact that the notice of motion was filed some time after the service of the order and after the acknowledgment of liability to pay those costs, as referred to above. As Peoplebank points out, at no time have any objections to the amount sought been notified or formulated. If it had a genuine concern as to the quantification of costs, Cytel had every opportunity to bring an application to set aside the certificate of taxation of which it acknowledged receipt. Cytel did not do so. Peoplebank has been forced to incur unnecessary costs in respect of an obligation to pay costs previously acknowledged. The attempt to avoid that payment and to extend the litigation is without merit and the burden of the solicitor-client costs of the motion should not be borne by Peoplebank ( Yang v American International Assurance Company (Australia) Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 493). </sentence>
