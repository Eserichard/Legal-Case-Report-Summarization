<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 440">As to the first argument, it is true that the material, to which objection is directed, had been obtained by the ACCC from Air New Zealand by the coercive process provided for in the TP Act. It is, however, to be borne in mind that the TP Act has very strong public interest objectives, and as Gordon J has observed in Cadbury Schweppes Proprietary Limited v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88 ; [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 at 146: 
 
 "[The] public interest in allowing private litigants to rely on the output of regulatory investigations, which are undertaken by public regulators at least in part on their behalf [is compelling]. " 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1348">In essence Optus's objection to the claims for privilege was that any privilege in the documents had been waived because the emails were communications with third parties. In its written outline of submissions, Optus put the point in three ways. First, the Media Ocean group had not established that "the communication was made within a clear regime of confidentiality" and that any individual who obtained the information was under an obligation of confidence to the applicants. Secondly, even if the communications with third parties were privileged, privilege was waived as "it appears from Mr Mattock's affidavit that in providing the documents to third parties, the applicants have destroyed their capacity to control further dissemination of any advice contained in the documents", relying on Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2008] FCA 88 , 246 ALR 137 (" Cadbury Schweppes ") at [17]. Thirdly, by providing third parties with the applicants' legal advice the Media Ocean group had dealt with the advice inconsistently with the maintenance of their privilege, relying on Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 (" Mann v Carnell ") at [28]-[29]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] NSWSC 607">20 I accept that the text of section 130(1) of the Evidence Act imposes the onus on the party seeking to have the Court exercise its discretion to prevent disclosure of a document, because it is the person seeking to prevent the production of document that must demonstrate the document relates to matters of state and that the balancing test favours non-production. This is consistent with the position under the common law: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88 at [25] . The onus is a "heavy burden" requiring the proponent of immunity who is resisting production to "establish a 'real' rather than merely 'some' or 'any' detriment to the public interest from disclosure" of the documents: Somerville v ASC (1995) 60 FCR 319 at 354.  49 The simple fact is that the State bears the onus of seeking to have the Court exercise its discretion to prevent disclosure of documents. In that regard the State is the person seeking to prevent the production of material documents and must demonstrate that the material documents relate to matters of state and that the balancing test favours non-production. The onus is a heavy burden requiring a proponent of the immunity who is resisting production to "establish a 'real' rather than merely 'some' or 'any detriment to the public interest from disclosure" of the documents: cf: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88 at [25] ; Somerville v ASC (1995) 60 FCR 319 at 354. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1283">Insofar as the State said legal professional privilege privilege attached because the topic of the advice is disclosed, that fact was made public by Mr V'Landys in his radio interview so the mere topic can hardly remain confidential. Moreover, the reference is in a document about a meeting between jurisdictions. Ms Mills' evidence about the confidentiality of inter-jurisdictional meetings does not establish a basis for drawing an inference that the State itself retained a right to control further disclosure of this information ( Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd (2008) 246 ALR 137 ; [2008] FCA 88 at [17] - [18]). If privilege subsisted in this statement, the privilege has been lost. Document 22 : In contrast to document 14, the part highlighted pink referring to legal advice remains confidential (it is in a draft Cabinet minute) and thus is privileged.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1140">Betfair noted that the claim for public interest immunity was said by Ms Mills to arise by reason of the class of the documents rather than their particular contents. Betfair referred to the observation of Stephen J in Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 62 that "those who urge Crown privilege for classes of documents, regardless of particular contents, carry a heavy burden". Betfair also referred to the observation of Gordon J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd (2008) 246 ALR 137 ; [2008] FCA 88 at [26] which needs to be understood by reference to the preceding paragraph: 
 
 [ 25 ] A court will not order the production of a document if disclosure of the document would be injurious to the public interest: Alister v R (1984) 154 CLR 404 ( Alister ); Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1. The court must undertake a balancing test, considering "whether the public interest which requires that [a] document should not be produced outweighs the public interest that a court of justice in performing its functions should not be denied access to relevant evidence": Sankey [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 38---39. As this formulation of the test makes clear, the onus is on the party seeking to prevent disclosure of a document. 
 

 
 
 [ 26 ] This onus has been described by Lindgren J as a "heavy burden" requiring the proponent of immunity to "establish a 'real' rather than merely 'some' or 'any' detriment to the public interest from disclosure" of the documents: Somerville v Australian Securities Commission (1995) 60 FCR 319 at 354. If the proponent cannot establish any such interest as a threshold matter, then the balancing test never arises, and the immunity claim will fail at the outset: As the High Court said in Alister at 412, "the balancing exercise ... can only be taken when it appears that both aspects of the public interest do require consideration (Emphasis added).

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 980">Although the use of documents and information obtained compulsorily in this way is constrained by s 155AAA and perhaps may be constrained by other general law principles, it is difficult to see how a party in the position of Allphones could sensibly expect that the information would be kept confidential and not disclosed even for legitimate purposes associated with the due performance by the ACCC of its statutory functions. It may be thought that this is particularly so in circumstances where Allphones made no express claim for confidentiality when the documents were produced. In Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 , [2008] ATPR 42-218 , Gordon J, in the context of considering claims that documents ought not to be disclosed on public interest immunity grounds, said (at [30]): 

The theoretical merit of the ACCC's confidentiality contentions is even more deficient. A cartel claim, by definition, involves collusion between two or more actors. In the same way that it is both inevitable and self-evident that the statements of a cooperating criminal conspirator will be used against (ie, disclosed to) the non-cooperating conspirators, it must be taken for granted that a cartel participant contemplating a confession to the authorities knows, or should know, that his statements will be used by the authorities to prosecute the other party or parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 422">Telstra opposed the tender of those paragraphs of the Lee Outline and the attachments, the subject of the grant of leave to use referred to in [41] above, on the ground that they were privileged, but fairly conceded that the weight of authority, in particular authority binding on me, was against its submission. The prevailing authority in this Court is in favour of the filing and service of an outline of evidence being a full waiver of privilege, such that the outline is then protected only by the implied undertaking to the Court not to use the document other than for the purpose of the proceeding without the leave of the Court: Liberty Funding Pty Ltd v Phoenix Capital Limited [2005] FCAFC 3 ; (2005) 218 ALR 283 at [20] --- [23]; Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 at [15] --- [19] per Gordon J; ACCC v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 678 at [122] --- [130] per Finn J; Australian Medi-Care Co Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd (No. 3) [2008] FCA 976 at [15] per Lander J. Once leave is granted to use the document, the party seeking to do so is released from the implied undertaking and may use it accordingly. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 442">Moreover, it is unnecessary for me to decide if it was practical for Cadbury to recreate the ACCC case in relation to these 18 customers in the manner alleged. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that I entertain some real doubt that it was practical for Cadbury to do so having regard to the competitive realities in the market between Cadbury and its competitors and its limited resources compared to those of the ACCC. In relation to the last matter, Cadbury's resources were more limited than those of the ACCC if only because the ACCC had compulsory powers available to it (which it used) which were not available to Cadbury. As I described in earlier reasons for decision concerning whether privilege subsisted in 111 witness proofs produced by the ACCC in relation to the ACCC proceeding, there is a public interest in allowing private litigants like Cadbury to rely on the output of regulatory investigations (such as the ACCC) which are undertaken by those regulators at least in part on their behalf: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 at [32] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCAFC 32">95 Since the hearing of this appeal, the decision of Gordon J has been considered by Finn J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 678 , where his Honour made the following observations:
 123 The case law in this country is discordant on whether one party to a proceedings can seek to tender admissions made in a witness statement or affidavit filed and served by another party in that proceeding pursuant to rule of court or court order, but who does not call the maker of that statement or read that affidavit. On one view, the statement or affidavit remains subject to legal professional privilege; on the other, filing and service operates, without more, as a full or limited waiver: see generally Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2008] FCA 88 at [12] - [19] where the case law has been helpfully reviewed by Gordon J. 124 As I am in entire agreement with the conclusions reached by her Honour on the proper approach to be taken to the question in a case such as the present --- particularly in light of observations made by the Full Court of this Court in Liberty Funding Pty Ltd v Phoenix Capital Ltd [2005] FCAFC 3 ; (2005) 218 ALR 283 at [25] --- my comments will be brief. 125 I am prepared to assume for present purposes that Sutton and Noonan's communications with the CFMEU's and Noonan's solicitors for the purpose of preparing their statements were confidential communications: cf Cadbury at [11]. 13 The primary judge decided that the privilege held by the ACCC in its finalised proofs of evidence was lost when the ACCC filed and served the witness proofs on Visy in the ACCC proceeding in compliance with the order of Heerey J. Justice Gordon, in her Honour's reasoning, stated that 'it was agreed between the parties that the only issue to be resolved is whether the ACCC waived privilege when it, at the direction of the Court, filed the documents and served them on Visy' ( Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88 at [12] ). Accordingly, her Honour did not address the question of whether the finalised proofs of evidence in question were privileged upon their creation and immediately prior to their service on Visy, or whether the service of each finalised proof of evidence was itself a separate communication which attracted legal professional privilege. An issue arose before us as to whether agreement was in fact reached between the parties or the concession made by Cadbury, in terms of that recorded by the primary judge. We will return to this matter later.

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1877">26 On the assumption that, at the outset of a s 19 examination, ASIC told an examinee that legal professional privilege may be availed of by that person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents that would reveal communications between a client and his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services, then disclosure by an examinee or witness of information in which he or she holds the privilege would constitute an act inconsistent with the maintenance of that privilege and privilege would be waived: see Cadbury [2008] FCA 88 ; 246 ALR 137 at [13] . So much may be accepted. It is consistent with the established principles on waiver.  In the circumstances specified (which includes ASIC's powers of investigation, examination and information gathering in Pt 3) , a lawyer may refuse to comply with a requirement to give information or produce a book, where to do so would involve the disclosure of a privileged communication with the lawyer in their capacity as a lawyer " unless ... the person to whom, or by or on behalf of whom, the communication was made consents to the lawyer complying with the requirement" (emphasis added): s 69(2). In other words, consistent with authority, the section proceeds on the premise that the holder of the privilege (being the client regardless of whether the client is an individual or a body corporate) must consent to the disclosure of the privilege it holds. No other party is able to waive the privilege; it is the holder of the privilege (the client) that must act inconsistently with the maintenance of that privilege for privilege to be waived: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 at [17] . Any other result is contrary to the fundamental principles summarised in [21] and [22] above. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1668">2 The ACCC opposes Cadbury being granted leave to uplift the transcript on the basis that the Hodgson Interview transcript is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege - specifically, litigation privilege - held by the ACCC. I previously considered at some length, in these proceedings, the legal principles and elements supporting a legal professional privilege claim: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 ( Cadbury I ). In Cadbury I , I noted that it is settled that for a claim of litigation privilege to be upheld, the document or communication in question must have been made (1) in anticipation of (or during) litigation; and (2) for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice or evidence for the litigation: Cadbury I at [10]. I observed that there might be a third element of confidentiality, particularly with respect to communications with a third-party witness, but that that aspect of litigation privilege is still unsettled: Cadbury I at [10]. Due to a concession on the part of Cadbury, I did not need to consider the confidentiality question further in that decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] VSC 392">60 Graham J's comment was made by way of obiter dicta and his Honour went on to note in the following paragraph that it was unnecessary for him to reach any concluded view in relation to this aspect of the matter. Telstra (No 2) has not subsequently been cited as supporting the proposition the respondents advance. [16] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 976">13 The two most recent decisions in this Court, Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 678 , indicate that any legal professional privilege in the statement is lost when the document is filed.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FCA 554">11 Jarra Creek submits that I should proceed to determine this issue, since the Visy parties have not agreed to be bound by the outcome of the appeal from the decision of Gordon J in Cadbury Schweppes v Amcor [2008] FCA 88.  13 It is not appropriate at this stage to determine whether the proofs of the Visy parties are privileged. However, I do not want to defer determination of this issue until the full appeal process from the decision of Gordon J in Cadbury Schweppes v Amcor [2008] FCA 88 has been exhausted. This would delay the matter significantly, and the matter has already had a long history. Protracted delay is not acceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FCA 398">20 The ACCC seeks a stay of the order for production for a period of days to allow time for the ACCC to consider whether to apply for leave to appeal from Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (ACN 004 551 473) v Amcor Limited (ACN 000 017 372) [2008] FCA 88 and, if such an application was made, for the Full Court to hear the application. In the circumstances, I would grant the ACCC a stay until 28 April 2008 or further order.  1 In Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (ACN 004 551 473) v Amcor Limited (ACN 000 017 372) [2008] FCA 88 I considered a claim by a non-party, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("ACCC"), of legal professional privilege and public interest immunity privilege in relation to specified documents created in connection with proceedings commenced by the ACCC against Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited and related entities ("Visy") ("the ACCC proceeding"). In the ACCC proceeding, Visy were ordered to pay approximately $36 million in penalties as a result of those entities colluding with Amcor Limited ("Amcor") to fix prices in the cardboard box market. </sentence>
