<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 106">5 One appeal concerned a challenge to a recommendation made on 5 May 2008 by the Chief Executive Officer of Customs to the Minister. The recommendation was that an anti-dumping notice was to take effect as if different variable factors had been fixed in respect to the exported goods the subject of the review. The recommendation was contained within Trade Measures Report No. 134 . A challenge was also made to the decision of the Minister made on 23 June 2008 to accept that recommendation. The primary Judge upheld the challenge and set aside the Minister's decision: Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd v Minister of State for Home Affairs [2009] FCA 837. This proceeding became known as " the review proceeding ".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 86">The requirements of s 269TACA(a) remain constant (although the manner of addressing material injury may vary for the reasons I have explained above) whether the non-injurious price is that initially set when the notice is given under s 269TG(2), or is affected by a declaration under s 269ZDB(1)(a). Although Confidential Appendix 5 set forth some calculations, including a quantification of the unsuppressed selling price and quantifications of profit and overseas freight and the like, there was an absence of explanation. The primary Judge noted ([2009] FCA 837 at [122]) the " absence of a reasoned explanation of how the Minister was entitled to change the variable factors, including the non-injurious price, relating to exports of the product to Australia by Siam ... The selection of the figures for these variable factors in the confidential sections of Report 134 had not been explained ". 132 It follows that no appellable error is discernible in His Honour's reasons for decision expressed in Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd v Minister of State for Home Affairs [2009] FCA 837 , 258 ALR 481.  23 Siam sought judicial review of both the decision of the Chief Executive Officer and also the Minister. The primary judge set aside the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations and the Minister's declaration in so far as they related to Siam: Siam Polyethylene Co Limited v Minister of State for Home Affairs [2009] FCA 837 ; 258 ALR 481. His Honour concluded that the Chief Executive Officer and the Minister had failed to ascertain whether dumping had caused or threatened any material injury and had failed to ascertain what anti-dumping measures were appropriate to meet that injury. The orders His Honour made on 12 August 2009 were, relevantly, as follows:
 
 
 2. In so far as they relate to the applicant, the recommendations made to the first respondent by the second respondent in Trade Measures Report 134 on or about 6 May 2008 under s 269ZDA(1) of the Customs Act 1901 be set aside. 3. In so far as they relate to the applicant, the declaration and public notice made by the first respondent under s 269ZDB(1) of the Customs Act 1901 and dated 23 June 2008 be set aside. 4. The first and second respondents pay the applicant's costs. 42 Separate from this principal issue dividing the parties, arguments were also directed to whether the primary Judge had erred in concluding that " the Minister gave no reasons for asserting ... that it was necessary to determine a non-injurious price under s 269TACA(a) for Siam less than the market price ": ([2009] FCA 837 at [124]). </sentence>
