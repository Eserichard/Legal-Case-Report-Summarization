<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 344">Section 115(2) of the Copyright Act provides for the award of damages for the wrong done. The general principles are well established: 
 
 
 Damages under s 115(2) are compensatory in nature. Any award of damages should reflect the deprecation to the value of the applicant's copyright as a chose in action that resulted from the respondent's infringing conduct: see Sutherland Publishing Co Ltd v Caxton Publishing Co Ltd [1936] Ch 323 at 336; [1936] 1 ER 177 at 180-1; Interfirm Comparison (Australia) Pty Ltd v Law Society of New South Wales (1975) 6 ALR 445 at 446 and Bailey v Namol Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1401 ; (1994) 53 FCR 102 at 110-11; [1994] FCA 1401 ; 125 ALR 228 at 237; [1994] FCA 1401 ; 30 IPR 147 at 155 ( Bailey ). The damages are to compensate for the loss suffered as a result of the infringement, not to punish the respondent ( Bailey at FCR 110-11; ALR 237 ; IPR 155; Norm Engineering Pty Ltd v Digga Australia Pty Ltd (2007) 162 FCR 1 ; 72 IPR 332 ; [2007] FCA 761 at [264] ( Norm Engineering ) (copyright case applying s 115(2)) and although reported cases may be of assistance, each case must be decided on its own particular facts ( Bailey at FCR 111; ALR 237 ; IPR 155).

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1298">In Norm Engineering v Digga Australia [2007] FCA 761 ; (2007) 162 FCR 1 at 79, Greenwood J summarised the principles which have been developed in relation to the exercise of the Court's powers under s 115(4): 
 
 "The principles influencing an assessment of damages under the section are these... [f]lagrancy is not an essential pre-requisite for an award of additional damages; it is sufficient if the court is satisfied that any one or more of the circumstances set out in s 115(4)(b) is established ( Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88 at 93 per Burchett J; at 103 per Tamberlin J and at 104 per Lehane J; Polygram Pty Ltd v Golden Editions Pty Ltd (1997) 76 FCR 565 at 575 per Lockhart J; Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788 at [158] per Jacobson J); additional damages under s 115(4) may be assessed having regard to principles derived from awards of aggravated and exemplary damages at common law ( Autodesk Inc v Yee (1996) 68 FCR 391 at 394 per Burchett J; Lamb v Cotongo [1987] HCA 47 ; (1987) 164 CLR 1 at 9-10 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ at pp 9, 10); one objective of an award is deterrence; an element of penalty is an accepted factor ( Autodesk v Yee 68 FCR at 384); the accrual of benefit by reason of the infringement to the respondent is a further factor and the notion of "benefit" suggests a pecuniary benefit to the respondent in excess of the damages otherwise payable ( Ravenscroft v Herbert [1980] RPC 193 (per Brightman J) at 208; the benefit need not be pecuniary ( Polygram v Golden Editions Pty Ltd 76 FCR at 576 per Lockhart J); and there need not be any proportionality between the amount of compensatory damages awarded pursuant to s 115(2) and the amount of additional damages awarded pursuant to s 115(4) ( Raben Footwear v Polygram Records 75 FCR at 93, 103 and 104; Microsoft Corporation v PC Club Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1522 ; (2005) 148 FCR 310 at 409, 410 per Conti J); and the assessment of the amount to be awarded is necessarily an imprecise exercise ( Bailey v Namol Pty Ltd 53 FCR at 114 per Burchett, Gummow and O'Loughlin JJ).

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 633">Under similar circumstances in Norm Engineering [2007] FCA 761 ; 162 FCR 1 , the Court adopted the "lost profits" method for calculating damages (at [266]-[271]); namely, (1) examine the number of sales made by the Respondent; (2) assume that the Respondent was trying to capture sales from the Applicant, the market leader; (3) assume that the number of sales made by the Respondent is equal to the number of sales lost by the Applicant; (4) discount the number in (3) to reflect the fact that not all sales made by the Respondent can be considered sales lost by the Applicant; and (5) apply any further discount necessary in the circumstances of the case: see also Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 668 ; (2006) 69 IPR 45 (employing a similar approach). In Norm Engineering [2007] FCA 761 ; 162 FCR 1 , the evidence disclosed, inter alia, that the Applicant was the recognised leader in the same market from whom the Respondent was actively seeking to divert sales and expert evidence was adduced calculating the sales lost by the Applicant.  Under similar circumstances in Norm Engineering [2007] FCA 761 ; 162 FCR 1 , the Court adopted the "lost profits" method for calculating damages (at [266]-[271]); namely, (1) examine the number of sales made by the Respondent; (2) assume that the Respondent was trying to capture sales from the Applicant, the market leader; (3) assume that the number of sales made by the Respondent is equal to the number of sales lost by the Applicant; (4) discount the number in (3) to reflect the fact that not all sales made by the Respondent can be considered sales lost by the Applicant; and (5) apply any further discount necessary in the circumstances of the case: see also Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 668 ; (2006) 69 IPR 45 (employing a similar approach). In Norm Engineering [2007] FCA 761 ; 162 FCR 1 , the evidence disclosed, inter alia, that the Applicant was the recognised leader in the same market from whom the Respondent was actively seeking to divert sales and expert evidence was adduced calculating the sales lost by the Applicant.  It is evidence of the other integers that is missing. There is no evidence about which entity was the market leader in t-shirts and no basis, whether from expert evidence or otherwise, to determine an appropriate discount factor, particularly given that, unlike the competitors in Norm Engineering [2007] FCA 761 ; 162 FCR 1 , the Applicant and the Respondent were selling to different markets at vastly different prices (approximately $50 versus $15). Indeed, even where the parties were selling to similar markets at similar prices in Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74 ; (2008) 166 FCR 358 (fact found by Jessup J at [23]), the Court found that the Applicant had failed to put forward sufficient evidence for it to draw an inference as to whether some or all of the sales made by the Respondent could be properly characterised as sales lost by the Applicant: see Innovative [2008] FCA 74 ; 166 FCR 358 , [25]-[26].  It is true that authority suggests that the Court has the right, and even duty, to speculate in calculating compensatory damages: Norm Engineering [2007] FCA 761 ; 162 FCR 1 at [295] (citing authority for the proposition that difficulty in estimating damages or the requirement of speculation does not relieve the Court of the responsibility of undertaking the exercise); Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 40 ; (2007) 157 FCR 564 at [35] . However, that duty is not absolute and the Court is entitled to consider the lack of assistance provided by the Applicant (in particular that the Applicant chose not to provide proper sales data and relied solely on the proposition that sales made by the Respondent should be taken as sales lost by the Applicant), in awarding damages for lost profits: Aristocrat [2007] FCAFC 40 ; 157 FCR 564 at [39] .  The Applicant has made an election for damages. Damages under s 115(2) are compensatory in nature. Any award of damages should reflect the depreciation to the value of the Applicant's copyright as a chose in action that resulted from the Respondent's infringing conduct: see Sutherland Publishing Company Ltd v Caxton Publishing Company Ltd [1936] Ch 323 , 336; Interfirm Comparison (Australia) Pty Ltd v Law Society of New South Wales (1975) 6 ALR 445 , 446 and Bailey v Namol Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1401 ; (1994) 53 FCR 102 , 110-111. The damages are to compensate for the loss suffered as a result of the infringement, not to punish the respondent ( Bailey v Namol Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1401 ; (1994) 53 FCR 102 , 110-111; Norm Engineering Pty Ltd v Digga Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 761 ; [2007] FCA 761 ; (2007) 162 FCR 1 at [264] (copyright case applying s 115(2)) and although reported cases may be of assistance, each case must be decided on its own particular facts: Bailey 53 FCR at 111.  How the Court should treat this lack of evidence may be said not to be settled: compare Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 668 ; (2006) 69 IPR 45 at [35] (acknowledging that relevant evidence could have been but was not provided by the Applicant, but nevertheless applying a 35% discount as a best guess); Norm Engineering [2007] FCA 761 ; 162 FCR 1 , [292]-[296] (applying a 50% discount even where there was evidence that both parties operated in a similar market and that the Respondent was actively attempting to divert sales from the Applicant as market leader); and Innovative [2008] FCA 74 ; 166 FCR 358 at [28] (effectively applying a discount of 100% by refusing to award any lost profits damages on the grounds that to do so would require excessive speculation). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1493">31 One method for assessing damages is the licence fee or royalty method. Under this approach, the owner of the copyright recovers "a sum equal to the fee that would fairly be charged for use of the copyright work": TS&amp;B at [206]. As Vawdrey properly conceded, such a method is often rejected if the court takes the view that the applicant would not have granted such a licence to the respondent because, for example, the parties are competitors or the copyright work was devised for a particular purpose and that purpose was frustrated or destroyed by the infringing use of the work by the respondent: see Bailey v Namol 53 FCR at 112 (concluding that lost profits is the better measure of damages where the copyright work was created for a specific purposes which has been frustrated by the infringement) and TS&amp;B at [206] (stating that the a lost profits approach is preferable to a licence fee approach where the plaintiff and infringer are "in actual or potential competition in relation to the copyright work"). See also Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 40 ; (2007) 157 FCR 564 at [27] - [29] ; Norm Engineering Pty Ltd v Digga Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 761 ; (2007) 162 FCR 1 at [257] , appeal allowed in part on other grounds at [2008] FCAFC 33 ; 166 FCR 268. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 953">23 On 23 December 2005, the applicant's expert, Mr David Van Homrigh, a chartered accountant and partner of KPMG prepared a report ('DVH1' to Mr Van Homrigh's affidavit field 1 June 2006) which addressed two areas of enquiry. First, an analysis of a series of 'worksheets' forwarded by email to KPMG by the respondent dated 24 November 2005 (Annexure 'B' to Mr Van Homrigh's report, 'DVH1') setting out calculations of costs, profits and losses incurred by the respondent in the manufacture and sale of the respondents 4 in 1 buckets (a 1550MM flat floor bucket and a 1727MM flat floor bucket). Mr Van Homrigh undertook a review of the respondent's calculations, produced an amended calculation of profits derived by the respondent and compared those outcomes with the applicant's data on costs and profits. Secondly, Mr Van Homrigh sought to calculate the damage suffered by the applicant by reason of the infringement of copyright. Mr Van Homrigh identified a method for the calculation of the applicant's damages which is the subject of discussion in Norm v Digga [2007] FCA 761 at [272] --- [290]. The report provides a critique of the alternative forms of relief.  1 On 18 May 2007, the Court published reasons for judgment in these proceedings ( Norm Engineering v Digga Australia [2007] FCA 761) , adjourned the matter to enable the parties to consider the form of final orders to be made and reserved for further consideration the question of the costs of the proceeding (including the final disposition of all reserved interlocutory costs) and any award of interest upon damages. </sentence>
