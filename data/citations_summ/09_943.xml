<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 124">119 His Honour went on to conclude that the UNFT was a tax imposed on a step in the production or distribution of goods, and accordingly, an excise. The consideration which proved decisive in his Honour's determination that the UNFT was a tax is the circumstance that the UNFT was passed on to customers. In his Honour's view, the UNFT was, therefore a tax and an excise. His Honour concluded: [2009] FCA 943 at [162] - [164]:
 Although, in form, the UNFT is charged to the owner of a network facility the charge is in fact converted into a charge to customers and consumers. In the case of QCC it was identified separately in accounts provided by ACTEW. As the network facility is the means by which water is carried, first for treatment and then, as potable water, distributed to customers, I think it right to regard the UNFT as a tax on a step in the production, sale and distribution of goods. That conclusion, it seems to me, accords with the requirement to pay regard to the practical operation of the UNFT Act, as well as its terms, and with the approach taken by the High Court in Chicory Marketing Board and Hematite of acknowledging the inevitable operation of the charge as an indirect tax on consumers. Accordingly the UNFT is a duty of excise. To the extent that the UNFT Act authorises it, that Act is invalid.  45 His Honour did not consider that it was necessary to resolve the conflict of evidence between Professor Grafton and Dr Beare. The judge did not regard the evidence of either witness as assisting him in the determination of the issues. He explained why at [2009] FCA 943 at [88] : 
 I do not see it as the function of the Court to enter this debate at all. The question of whether there is no discernible relationship between the WAC and the value of water abstracted by ACTEW, assuming that to be the test, cannot be resolved by the preference for one set of value judgments over another. What is critical to the examination of such a question is not which approach to the estimation of value is to be preferred but whether it can be said that there is an absence of any relationship between the charge and the value of the commodity or service in question. In the end Dr Beare's opinion could not sustain any proposition that there was an absence of such a relationship. At its highest it involved a debate about the justification for a remainder over the specific values which he conceded.  First, the WAC could be viewed as a fee for service. It was argued that the quantum of the WAC could not be said to have "no discernible relationship" with the value of the service of the provision of potable water. In relation to this first argument, his Honour said at [2009] FCA 943 at [118] - [120]:
 [W]ater is a commodity. Apart from other uses it may be consumed in its potable form. ACTEW is in the business of supplying water. 40 The trial judge found that the purpose of the 30 cents per litre increase in the WAC from July 2006 was to raise additional revenue for the ACT: [2009] FCA 943 at [108] and that the WAC was, and was intended to be, passed on to domestic consumers: [2009] FCA 943 at [108] .  (b) The price value approach. On this view, it is legitimate to value goods, services, rights or privileges exhibiting monopoly qualities by looking at the actual price charged for them, that is, the price including any monopoly rents. This was the view of the learned trial judge who could perceive "no reason why the ACT may not realise the underlying value of a commodity vested in it" ( Queanbeyan City Council v ACTEW Corporation Ltd [2009] FCA 943 ; (2009) 178 FCR 510 at 535 [120] ) so that it could not be open to conclude that the fees "have no discernible relationship with the value of the water" (178 FCR at 535 [120]). Another way of putting that argument is to observe that whilst monopoly pricing may well be unattractive that does not mean it is not a reflection, at some level, of value. (c) The relevance approach. 115 The learned trial judge noted that the UNFT had the positive attributes of a tax and rejected the argument put by the ACT and ACTEW that the UNFT was not a tax because it was, in truth, a charge for the use or occupation of land: [2009] FCA 943 at [133] - [141].  117 The trial judge concluded that the UNFT is a tax. The judge found that the UNFT applies to all network utilities on land in the ACT, including National Land and Territory Land (apart from a network facility in respect of which there is, relevantly, a lease in relation to the use of the Land for a utility network. His Honour said [2009] FCA 943 at [133] - [135]:
 There seems no doubt that the UNFT has the positive attributes identified in Air Caledonie which give a charge the character of a tax. It is compulsory, for public purposes, and enforceable by law. The ACT and ACTEW contended, however, that the UNFT is not a tax because it is properly to be seen as a charge for the use or occupation of land. 44 On the way to his conclusion, the judge rejected as irrelevant evidence which was said to bear upon the characterisation of the WAC insofar as the existence of a discernible relationship between the value of water appropriated by ACTEW and the quantum of the WAC is apt to distinguish a fee for service from a tax. ACTEW sought to rely upon evidence from Professor Grafton and the QCC sought to rely on the evidence of Dr Beare. His Honour summarised aspects of that evidence at [2009] FCA 943 at [86] - [87]:
 Professor Rupert Grafton is Professor of Economics and Research Director at the Crawford School of Economics and Government at the Australian National University. He was asked to express an opinion on whether there was a discernible relationship between the value of water for urban supply in the ACT and the WAC at each of the levels fixed above 10 cents per kilolitre and also whether any relevant matters had emerged post October 2003 which might bear upon that question. Professor Grafton's opinion was that the ACT could, and should, have charged more for the abstraction of water than it actually did at any relevant period in time. 41 His Honour accepted that, in order to meet the demands of its customers, it was necessary, practically and commercially, for ACTEW to take ACT water for distribution to its customers, and that ACTEW's customers had no practical alternative to taking that water: [2009] FCA 943 at [110] , [117]. 43 The second justification for the view that the WAC is not a tax is that it is an impost directed to managing demand for a scarce resource. In relation to this argument, the trial judge said at [2009] FCA 943 at [121] - [124]:
 The second element justifying the 30 cents water fee was the stated broader policy objective of assisting in the management of demand for water. Such an objective appears to fall within the views expressed by Mason CJ, Deane and Gummow JJ in Harper. It is not inconsistent with the views expressed by Brennan J. 118 The trial judge regarded the circumstance that the UNFT applies to networks other than the water network as irrelevant. His Honour reasoned: [2009] FCA 943 at [160] - [162]:
 In the present case I am concerned only with the substantive effect of the charge imposed on water networks. The only water network to which the charge applies is that operated by ACTEW pursuant to licences held by it under the Utilities Act . The UNFT applies to network facilities other than those concerned with water, as operated by ACTEW. There is no evidence before me concerning those other network facilities. My task in the present proceedings is only to decide whether the UNFT imposed on ACTEW is a duty of excise. That task only requires attention to the character of the charge imposed upon ACTEW. A conclusion about that matter is neither dictated by, nor dictates, the character of the charge on any other network facility (see Western Australia v Chamberlain Industries Pty Limited [1970] HCA 5 ; (1970) 121 CLR 1 per Barwick CJ at 15). </sentence>
