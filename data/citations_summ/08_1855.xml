<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 646">18 On 9 December 2008 at Mornington Island, I made orders by consent that the Lardil, Yangkaal, Gangalidda and Kaiadilt People held native title over all lands and waters to the High Water Mark on the islands bounded by the determination area in the Wellesley Islands Sea Claim as determined by the Federal Court on 23 February 2004. The Gangalidda People's native title rights and interests in Allen, Little Allen, Horseshoe, Bayley and Pains Islands were recognised in that determination: Lardil, Yangkaal, Gangalidda and Kaiadilt People v State of Queensland &amp; Ors [2008] FCA 1855 ( Lardil, Yangkaal, Gangalidda and Kaiadilt People Land Claim ). In considering that application, I had the benefit of a significant amount of evidence from witnesses and experts. Much of this evidence was collected for the purposes of the Wellesley Sea Claim, before Cooper J: The Lardil Peoples v State of Queensland [2004] FCA 298 ( Lardil ). The evidence relied on in Lardil and the Lardil, Yangkaal, Gangalidda and Kaiadilt People Land Claim determinations as it relates to the Gangalidda People is relevant to this claim. </sentence>
