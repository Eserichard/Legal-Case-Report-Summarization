<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 283">Section 94(2) requires that the relevant detriment be " on the ground that the other person " has done or proposed to do one of the things listed. Although the prohibited reason may not be the sole factor, it must be a " substantial and operative " factor in causing the alleged detriment (see Obieta v New South Wales Department of Education and Training and Ors [2007] FCA 86 at [240] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 22">I have considered the case to which I was referred on the last occasion to Lina Obieta v New South Wales Department of Education and Training [2007] FCA 86 at [236] and I have also considered other cases, including Dye v Commonwealth Securities Ltd [2010] FCA 720 ; O'Callaghan v Loder [1983] 3 NSWLR 89 and Ministry of Defence v Jeremiah [1980] QB 87. I think the third respondent is correct when she submits that the question of detriment must be determined objectively ( Lina Obieta v New South Wales Department of Education and Training [2007] FCA 86 at [236] ).</sentence>

On the face of it, it is difficult to see that one unanswered telephone call, albeit late at night, constitutes a detriment within subsection 94(2). However, I do not propose to decide the third respondent's submission at this stage. I will consider the submission once the pleadings related to victimisation contain an appropriate plea of motive or purpose. The pleas relating to the alleged unlawful acts, omissions or practices

 32 The Federal Court has applied the same test in relation to the victimisation provision in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth): Obieta v NSW Department of Education &amp; Training [2007] FCA 86 at [240] ; Huang v University of NSW [2008] FMCA 11 at [120] . 33 In our view, Buchanan J's observation that the ground or reason 'must afford a rational explanation, at least in part, "why" an action was taken' is correct. The formulation of the test in that way is consistent with the High Court's formulation of the test for causation in discrimination complaints in Purvis.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] NSWADT 271">71 In Nicholls and Nicholls v Director General, Department of Education and Training (No 2) [2009] NSWADTAP 20 the Appeal Panel noted that the Federal Court has applied the same test in relation to the victimisation provision in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) in Obieta v NSW Department of Education &amp; Training [2007] FCA 86 at [240] ; see also Huang v University of NSW [2008] FMCA 11 at [120] . The Appeal Panel continued at [33]:
 
"In our view, Buchanan J's observation that the ground or reason 'must afford a rational explanation, at least in part, "why" an action was taken' is correct. The formulation of the test in that way is consistent with the High Court's formulation of the test for causation in discrimination complaints in Purvis . However, by requiring that the reason must be 'substantial' Buchanan J formulated a different test from that in discrimination complaints. The point of difference is that even if a reason was one of the grounds for imposing the detriment, a victimisation complaint will not be substantiated unless that reason is a 'substantial' reason. "</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 957">The first respondent submitted generally in relation to the claim of victimisation that in paragraphs 28 and 29 Ms Davidson had failed to plead the basis upon which this conduct constituted victimisation, in that she failed to plead the facts, matters and circumstances on which she alleged that she proposed to make a complaint, or reasonably proposed to assert her rights under the anti-discrimination legislation prior to suffering the alleged act of victimisation and the facts, matters and circumstances by which the act of victimisation was taken for a prohibited reason, that was a " substantial and operating factor " (see Penhall-Jones v NSW [2007] FCA 925 at [69] ; Lina Obieta v New South Wales Department of Education and Training and Ors [2007] FCA 86 at [240] ; Huang v University of New South Wales &amp; Ors [2008] FMCA 11 at [120] ; Damiano &amp; Anor v Wilkinson &amp; Anor [2004] FMCA 891 at [22] ). In addition, it was contended that the facts, matters and circumstances on which Ms Davidson alleged that she had suffered some detriment as a result of the act of victimisation, and the basis upon which McCanns was liable for the alleged conduct were not pleaded. </sentence>

32 The Federal Court has applied the same test in relation to the victimisation provision in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth): Obieta v NSW Department of Education &amp; Training [2007] FCA 86 at [240] ; Huang v University of NSW [2008] FMCA 11 at [120] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1930">110 Federal Magistrate Driver pointed out that victimisation is dealt with in s 94 of the Sex Discrimination Act . By s 94(2) victimisation for the purposes of the section concerns a person being subjected or threatened with detriment on the ground that they made or proposed to make a complaint under that Act or the HREOC Act or took steps in relation to HREOC. One or more of those matters must be a ' substantial and operative ' factor in the detriment to which Ms Huang was subjected or threatened with (see Obieta v New South Wales Department of Education and Training [2007] FCA 86 at [240] ). Ms Huang did not identify to Driver FM the detriment to which she alleged she was subjected or the acts referred to in s 94(2)(a) ---(g) of the Sex Discrimination Act , or the course that she took or proposed taking, or the knowledge that the first, second or third respondents had concerning those acts, or the connection between any of those acts and the detriment alleged. The Federal Magistrate pointed out at [122] that Ms Huang had not identified evidence of those matters. His Honour found, from the evidence, that Ms Huang first raised her allegations of sexual harassment at her meeting with Miss Nabke-Hatton on 22 March 2002 and that the respondents did not know of her allegations of unlawful discrimination before that date. His Honour found that there was no evidence that Ms Huang ever raised any assertion of unlawful discrimination before that time. By then her supervisors had already told her that they would not be supporting her re-enrolment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 11">I accept and adopt, subject to my following observations, the respondents' submissions on this issue. Section 8 of the SDA and s.10 of the DDA do not apply to victimisation. One or more of the matters referred to in s.94(2) of the SDA must be a 'substantial or operative' factor in the detriment to which Ms Huang is subjected or threatened with ( Obieta v NSW Dept of Education &amp; Training [2007] FCA 86 at [240] ; Damiano and Another v Wilkinson and Another [2004] FMCA 891 at [22] ; Bailey v ANU (1995) EOC 92-744). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCA 1051">

22 Whether an act does constitute sexual harassment in terms of s 28A SD Act clearly depends upon the nature or the quality of the act: Cowdroy J in Obieta v New South Wales Dept of Education and Training [2007] FCA 86 at [238] , Cooke v Plauen Holdings [2001] FMCA 91 at [25] . It is not immediately clear to me that conduct of the first respondent which his Honour found was harassment of the appellant in the context of her wish to form a relationship with him, was not, in the absence of a hearing where relevant evidence and legal principles were considered, "unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the person harassed". Conduct in the nature of persistent personal invitations has, in some cases, and in conjunction with other acts, been held to constitute sexual harassment (cf for example Doyle v Riley (1995) EOC 92-748). Further, it has been contemplated that aggressive conduct following a rejection could constitute harassment of a sexual nature (note comments of Driver FM in Cooke [2001] FMCA 91 at ([30]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 925">84 Reference was made in Bailey to Morrison-Liddy . Reference was made also to O'Callaghan v Loder [1983] 3 NSWLR 89 at 95 where Mathews DCJ rejected the argument that the phrase 'on the ground' required that the particular factor be the only motivating factor. A similar approach was taken in Waterhouse v Bell (1991) 25 NSWLR 99 at 106. Much more recently Cowdroy J has applied the same approach in Obieta v New South Wales Department of Education and Training [2007] FCA 86 at [240] (referring to Damiano and Bailey) .</sentence>
