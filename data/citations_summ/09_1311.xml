<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 490">The manner of operation of ss 200 and 201, and the meaning to be given to the term " irregularity ", have been previously considered in Re Killesteyn, in the matter of an application for an inquiry in relation to offices in the Australian Salaried Medical Officers' Federation (Qld) [2009] FCA 1311 , 261 ALR 730. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 416">Section 201 of the Act sets forth the circumstances in which an inquiry is to be conducted and provides, inter alia , that the Court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the application. In Re Killesteyn (Application for an Enquiry in Relation to Election for Offices in the Australian Salaried Medical Officers' Federation (Qld)) [2009] FCA 1311 ; (2009) 261 ALR 730 , Flick J considered the preconditions for the holding of an inquiry and the level of satisfaction that the Court must reach. As his Honour pointed out at [25]: 
 
 The level of satisfaction required is that prescribed by the legislature; namely, the Court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the application being made.
