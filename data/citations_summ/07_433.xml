<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 897">In the case of Heilbrunn v Lightwood PLC [2007] FCA 433 at [10] , Allsop J (as his Honour then was) observed: 
 
 It is clear from a number of cases in New South Wales decided in the 1980s on a cognate rule that damage in the rule does not mean the injury which completed the tort, but rather it means the disadvantage or detriment suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the tortious act or omission of the defendant. In this respect the word "damage" in this context has a wider meaning than injury.
