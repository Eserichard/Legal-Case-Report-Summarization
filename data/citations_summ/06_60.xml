189 If the reasoning in Wood [131] were to be adopted in the present case, VCAT could certainly be described as not only a 'court', but also a 'court of a State'.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] VCAT 1535">Such relevant developments in the law as there have been since 2007 have fortified the conclusion I reached in the Ali case that this Tribunal is not a "court" for the purposes of an international convention which has the force of a Commonwealth statute. In his Ali case I referred to a decision which tended to point the other way: Commonwealth v Wood [2006] FCA 60 ; (2006) 227 ALR 63. But the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commonwealth of Australia v Anti-Discrimination Tribunal (Tasmania) and Nichols [2008] FCA 104 overruled Commonwealth v Wood and cited with approval a New South Wales Court of Appeal decision, Trust Company of Australia (trading as Stockland Property Management) v Skiwing Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 185 ; (2006) 66 NSW LR 77 (commonly referred to as "Stockland'). In Ali I had referred to Stockland and had stated that my conclusion conformed with it. Moreover, the President of the Tribunal, Justice Ross, in ABY, ABZ v Patient Review Panel [2011] VCAT 904 (27 May 2011) has decided that this Tribunal is not a "court" capable of exercising Federal jurisdiction for determining that a State law is unconstitutional.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] NSWCA 60">In Commonwealth v Wood [2006] FCA 60 ; 148 FCR 276 , Heerey J held that the Commonwealth was a "person" for the purposes of the application of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 (Tas), s 16. His Honour held that s 4 , which stated (similarly to s 7 of the Evidence Act ) that the Act bound the Crown in right of the State (Tasmania) and, so far as was permissible, in all other capacities, extended to bind the Crown in right of the Commonwealth. In so finding, Heerey J gave weight to the fact that the Anti-Discrimination Act was beneficial legislation, which ought to be construed liberally and that "since s 4 provides expressly that the Crown in the right of Tasmania is bound, the Crown, at least in that capacity, must be a 'person' for the purpose of s 16" (at 283). Heerey J's decision was not followed in Commonwealth v Anti-Discrimination Tribunal (Tasmania) [2008] FCAFC 104 ; 169 FCR 85 , per Weinberg J and Kenny J, Goldberg J dissenting. Weinberg J held that, reading the Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 (Tas) as a whole, the construction supported by s 4 that the Commonwealth was a "person", was outweighed by indications elsewhere in the Act which tended against that being the case (at 118). Kenny J also found that the Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 (Tas), viewed as a whole, did not apply to the Commonwealth as a person. Her Honour noted that the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 (Tas), s 41(1) (unlike the Commonwealth and New South Wales Acts) stated that the expression "person" "shall include any body of persons, corporate or unincorporated, other than the Crown" (at 123). Kenny J also noted that the definition of a "person" in the Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 (Tas), s 3 , included an "organisation" and "organisation" was defined to include "a council, a Government department ... or a State authority". Her Honour held that the specific reference to State authorities and State departments and local government, which would come within that term in the absence of reference to other bodies politic weighed against the term "organisation", and, therefore, "person" as including the Commonwealth (at 125-126).

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] NSWADT 74">16 The other authorities, which are not directly relevant, relate to circumstances where the complainant was alive when the discrimination was alleged to have occurred but died either before or after a complaint had been lodged. The courts have held, pursuant to comparable legislation, that a complaint made at either of those times can be made or continued after the person has died: Commonwealth of Australia v Wood [2006] FCA 60 at [43] ; Stephenson v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1996) 68 FCR 290 at 298. In New South Wales, the law is clear that a complaint can continue even if the complainant dies after having lodged a complaint with the Anti-Discrimination Board: AD Act , s 93. That situation arose in Commissioner of Police v Estate of Russell (2002) 55 NSWLR 232 at [2]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] HCATrans 366">Over at page 144 --- I will not read it or refer to it in detail, but her Honour deals with the reasons of Justice Heerey in Wood [2006] FCA 60 ; 148 FCR 276 , where his Honour had concluded that although the members of the tribunal can be removed at will, there was provision for judicial review, which was a sanction of sorts which might be thought to give the public confidence in the tenure of these members, and secondly, his Honour adverted to public opprobrium that might meet a peremptory removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] QDC 337"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCAFC 104">35 Telstra Corporation Ltd v Worthing (supra) was considered by Heerey J in Commonwealth v Wood [2006] FCA 60 ; (2006) 148 FCR 276 , in which he concluded that the Anti-Discrimination Act bound the Commonwealth and agents of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth criticised the reasoning of Heerey J, in particular on the basis that he did not respond to the proposition that:
 "The silence in s 3 of the Act concerning Commonwealth bodies indicates that Commonwealth bodies were not intended to be caught by the definition of 'organisation' for the purposes of s 3. " 

The proposition had been accepted by the Tribunal in Murphy v Family Court of Australia [2002] Tas ADT 9 and Daly &amp; Swanton v ABA [2005] Tas ADT 2. The Commonwealth submitted that Heerey J assumed that the indication in s 4 of the Anti-Discrimination Act of an intent to bind the Crown meant that the Commonwealth must be a "person" for the purposes of the Anti-Discrimination Act .  176 In reaching this conclusion, I am mindful that Goldberg J in this case and Heerey J in Commonwealth v Wood [2006] FCA 60 ; (2006) 148 FCR 276 (" Wood ") have taken a contrary view. In reaching the contrary view in Wood , Heerey J referred, at 283-285, to the beneficial character of the State legislation and to the "highly pervasive presence" of the Commonwealth in Tasmania, in this latter regard observing that (at 283):
 "Apart from the Tasmanian capacity, the Crown's capacity in the right of the Commonwealth is, of all the Crown's capacities, the one most likely to be exercised in Tasmania, as the Tasmanian Parliament would be well aware. ... There is no logical reason to impute to the State Parliament an intention not to bind the Commonwealth, insofar as it has the power to do so, in relation to this important area of social policy. Turning to the text of the [Anti-Discrimination Act], since s 4 provides expressly that the Crown in the right of Tasmania is bound, the Crown, at least in that capacity, must be a 'person' for the purposes of s 16. ... I conclude therefore that as, by s 4, Parliament intended to bind the Crown in capacities other than in the right of Tasmania, those capacities must include the Crown's capacity in the right of the Commonwealth. " 

But for the considerations to which I now turn, I would agree. 141 In Commonwealth v Wood [2006] FCA 60 ; (2006) 148 FCR 276 , Heerey J held that the Commonwealth was a "person" for the purposes of the Anti-Discrimination Act . His Honour relied in part upon s 4 , which, as indicated above, states that the Act is intended to bind the Crown, not just in right of Tasmania, but so far as the legislative power of the Parliament permits, "in all its other capacities". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] WASAT 59">36 There has been considerable recent consideration of the status of state tribunals and whether or not they may be considered a "court of a State" for the purposes of Chapter III of the Australian Constitution : see for example Commonwealth v Wood [2006] FCA 60 ; (2006) 148 FCR 276 ; Trust Company of Australia Ltd v Skiwing Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 185 ; (2006) 66 NSWLR 77 ; Attorney General (NSW) v 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 349 ; (2006) 236 ALR 385.</sentence>

In Commonwealth v Wood [2006] FCA 60 ; [2006] 227 ALR 631 a single Judge of the Federal court, Heerey J., held that the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Tribunal was a "court" capable of exercising federal jurisdiction. His Honour's reasoning, if applied to this Tribunal, would characterise this Tribunal as a "court" for the purpose under discussion. The New South Wales Court of Appeal, however, in Trust Company of Australia Ltd v Skiwing Pty Ltd [2006] 66 1 NSWLR 77 disapproved of the reasoning of Heerey J, and reached conclusions which seem to me to be consistent with and supportive of the opinion expressed by Deputy President Macnamara in Maltall .

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2006] WASAT 367">33 There have been two recent decisions, one of the Federal Court of Australia and the other of the NSW Court of Appeal, which provide some guidance. In Commonwealth of Australia v Wood [2006] FCA 60 (9 February 2006) Heerey J held that the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Tribunal was a court for the purposes of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 (Tas). In Trust Company of Australia Limited (trading as Stockland Property Management) v Skiwing Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 185 (13 July 2006) Spigelman CJ, Hodgson and Bryson JJA concluded that the Administrative Decisions Tribunal was not a court. In Skiwing the Court noted that for many statutory purposes the Tribunal would have sufficient of the characteristics of a court to answer a statutory provision relating to "courts" but that for the purposes of the use of powers under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) it was necessary to meet the requirements to constitute a "court of a State" within the meaning of s 77(iii) of the Australian Constitution (Cth). Those words were understood as a constitutional expression, so that any investiture of Federal jurisdiction in a State court, as part of an integrated system of justice, requires a high degree of similarity in the fundamental institutional characteristics of the component parts of that system (at [47]). Thus, in order for Federal jurisdiction to be permissibly conferred upon it, a "court of a State" must --- exclusively, or at least predominantly --- be constituted by judges (at [49]). Accordingly, in its analysis of the function of the Tribunal in Skiwing , the focus was on whether or not it met the requirements of a "court of a State" having regard to the constitutional overlay, but for which, it was recognised, the Tribunal would have sufficient of the characteristics of a court for many statutory purposes. By reason of these requirements, the court differed from the decision in Commonwealth v Wood , which was criticised for not considering the constitutional case law demonstrating the requirement for the court to be composed of judges. 
 27 The Tribunal is not called a "court". But it is the function and purpose of the Tribunal and not its nomenclature which must determine whether it qualifies as a court for the purposes of s 34 of the SC Act: Australian Postal Commission v Dao (No 2) (1986) 69 ALR 125 , Commonwealth of Australia v Wood [2006] FCA 60 ; (2006) 148 FCR 276. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2006] FCAFC 169">The appellant contended before the primary judge, as he does here, that s 23 of the State FOI Act was 'picked up' by operation of s 79 of the Judiciary Act and became a 'surrogate federal law': McLeod v Australian Securities and Investment Commission (2002) 211 CLR 287 at 302, at [44] ( McLeod ); Commonwealth of Australia v Wood [2006] FCA 60 ; (2006) 148 FCR 276 at [33] - [34] ( Wood ). He says that section was in conflict with s 24A of the FOI Act and the State FOI Act (being the later Act) applied to the extent of any conflict or inconsistencies with s 24A. He argued the respondent's conduct amounted to a constructive refusal and/or a failure to give notice of a determination pursuant to s 23 of the State FOI Act. In his view, University of Wollongong v Metwally [1984] HCA 74 ; [1984] HCA 74 ; (1984) 158 CLR 447 ( Metwally) assisted his argument. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2006] WASCA 219">115 The process of characterisation which is to be undertaken to determine the extent of a body's jurisdiction is distinct from, but nevertheless has some similarity to the question of whether a body is a "court of a State" within the meaning of s 77 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. In both exercises, the critical questions are those of function and purpose, not nomenclature - see Australian Postal Commission v Dao (No 2) (1986) 6 NSWLR 497 , 515 per McHugh JA; Commonwealth v Wood [2006] FCA 60 ; (2006) 148 FCR 276 , per Heerey J.

<sentence id="cs13" from="[2006] TASADT 5">15. Written submissions were received from the Commissioner dated 24 October, 2004. Mr "W" did not provide written submissions. It is noted that in relation to the substantive complaint it was investigated by the Commissioner and referred to the Tribunal for Inquiry. After the referral for Inquiry and during the stage that directions conferences were being conduct the complaint was not pursued by the Complainant. Subsequently, the Tribunal received information that sadly, Mr "W" passed away on 15 August, 2005. The substantive complaint was then dismissed by the Tribunal on 21 September, 2005. While it could be argued that Mr "W"'s death brought an end to this application for review, based on a consideration of the Act and the Federal Court decision of Commonwealth of Australia v Wood (2006) FCA 60 the Tribunal considers it appropriate to presume, without deciding this issue, that the application is not brought to an end and will proceed to consider the application. For this reason and noting the application raises matters of public interest the Tribunal considered it appropriate to deliver a decision in this matter even though the balance of the complaint has been dismissed by the Tribunal.</sentence>

67 My above analysis is not consistent with the reasoning of Heerey J in Commonwealth v Wood [2006] FCA 60 ; (2006) 148 FCR 276. His Honour does not consider the constitutional case law in the way I have done. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2006] VCAT 623">11 The apprehension of bias principle in respect of judicial officers applies in much the same manner to tribunals based upon the judicial model. In State jurisdictions it is common for tribunals to be based upon this model and to possess many characteristics of courts. [9] Thus it has been held that the former Administrative Appeals Tribunal of Victoria (which has effectively been subsumed in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal) is subject to the same principles of natural justice in relation to bias as would apply to a court.
