 The proceeding has a long history. On 31 March 2006, the primary judge heard and determined an application by the appellant to adduce certain expert opinion evidence at the trial and the respondent's objection to the receipt of that evidence. The primary judge decided not to admit the evidence and he delivered reasons for his decision: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 ; (2006) 228 ALR 719. I will refer to this decision as the evidence ruling. On 27 April 2006, the primary judge delivered his decision on the appellant's application. The primary judge accepted that Dr Gibbs has specialised knowledge ( Cadbury Schweppes v Darrell Lea [2006] FCA 363 ; (2006) 228 ALR 719 ; 28 ATPR 42-112 (the "evidence ruling")).

Opinion evidence about the meaning of general terms is also usually inadmissible. Evidence about the ultimate issue is admissible under s 80 of the Evidence Act .

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 200">30 Dayals criticises the absence of expert evidence concerning the reputation of Natural Waters or Fiji Water and, in particular, the absence of survey evidence as to the reputation in, and public recognition of, the "constellation of features" relied upon by Natural Waters. There is no suggestion that such survey evidence was obtained and not adduced; the evidence is that Natural Waters has not engaged market research in this area. Natural Waters has adduced evidence of the sales, marketing and promotion of Fiji Water. Natural Waters submits, with reference to Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 ; (2006) 228 ALR 719 at [11] ---[12] that expert evidence of reputation or consumer association would be unhelpful and inadmissible as it could amount to no more than an opinion on a matter that is not outside the experience of ordinary persons. As a general proposition, evidence as to the reputation of an applicant's packaging or get-up in the mind of the consumer may be adduced ( Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Limited [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 387 per Gummow J with whom Black CJ and Lockhart J agreed). The evidence ruled inadmissible in Cadbury seemed to concern the likelihood of deception rather than reputation (at [5]) and evidence of consumer recognition, in the form of a "chocolate sensory study" was admitted ( Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 446 ; (2006) 229 ALR 136 at [69] ).

Whilst Mr Lewis was attempting to be helpful I did not allow into evidence his opinion about whether or not the drinks room was a bar. This ruling was also applied to foreshadowed evidence the Hyatt intended to call. This ruling was made on the basis that the claimed expertise underpinning the opinions sought to be given, was not based upon a field of expert knowledge. There is no sufficiently organised or recognised field of expert knowledge as to what is a bar.

 The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and, secondly, upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products.

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2006] FCA 850">28 Certainly the size and cost of this litigation is troubling. Although there was no dispute as to the applicable law, and very little real dispute as to primary fact, the trial extended over 12 days, with experienced senior and junior counsel on both sides, and a 10,557 page court book. If Cadbury had its way, the trial would have included issues of quantum and also much expert evidence, and probably taken another week at least. The threat of ruinous costs in such litigation, even if it is "only" irrecoverable costs for a party who succeeds, has important practical consequences for competition: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 at [30] - [31].  9 Disputes as to names and get-ups between rival traders constitute a familiar genre of commercial litigation. The applicable law is well settled. Questions as to the nature of the reputation enjoyed by a plaintiff and the effect of a defendant's conduct on consumers are likely to be problematic. In the present case Cadbury was obviously encouraged by the experts it had recruited. In the present case I held that most of this evidence was inadmissible: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363. Judges of this Court and a learned commentator had previously expressed disquiet about evidence of this nature: Cat Media Pty Ltd v Opti-Healthcare Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 133 at [55] , Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd v .au Domain Administration Ltd [2004] FCAFC 247 ; (2004) 139 FCR 215 at [21] , Heydon, Cross on Evidence (7 th Australian ed, 2004) at 930. There had been no decision in this Court ruling directly that such evidence was inadmissible, although there had been English and Irish decisions to that effect: Dalgety Spillers Foods Ltd v Food Brokers Ltd [1994] FSR 504 at 527, Symonds Cider &amp; English Wine Company Ltd v Showerings (Ireland) Ltd [1997] IEHC 1 at [20] . So while a litigant properly advised should have realised that there were potential problems with evidence of this kind, it would be going too far to say that seeking to tender it demonstrated wilful disregard of clearly established law.
