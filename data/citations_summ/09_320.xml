<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 423">Accordingly, so RLA's argument goes, it should be inferred that, if O'Brien's documents had been available to the Court, they would not have supported the respondent's case, but rather, would have supported RLA's case. RLA also relied on Katsilis v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1978) 52 ALJR 189 , where Barwick CJ suggested at 197 that; 
[o]rdinarily, though a case is normally better tried on the evidence which is produced than on that which is not, it can properly be said that the failure of a party to give or produce evidence which, in the circumstances of the case, that party in its own interest would be expected to give or produce, warrants the conclusion that, if given or produced, the evidence would not support that party's case. Indeed, in some circumstances it might be inferred that it would support the opponent's case; but, if so, it must depend very much on the circumstances. But, in any case, the inference would depend upon some element of conscious repression or withholding of the evidence. The warrant for the inference must depend upon the deliberation with which the evidence is withheld and the appreciation or likely appreciation of the party of its significance in the case. In Research in Motion Ltd v Samsung Electronics Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 320 ; (2009) 176 FCR 66 , Kenny J suggested, at [30]---[34] that, for the presumption to operate, it must be shown that there has been deliberate destruction of documents with the intention of destroying evidence. Conversely, in MCT Dairies Inc v Probiotec Limited [2009] FCA 1385 , Rares J held, at [36], that the presumption arises even if no intention to destroy evidence has been shown. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] SASC 29">Firstly, because the cash-flow forecast is not a document which is shown to be central to the plaintiff's case. The plaintiff was never given a copy of it and does not know its contents. It surmises that its contents may show that the first defendant expected to renew the plaintiff's franchise on its expiration and thus be evidence it was aware of the understanding with the prior franchisor. However, whether it has any weight as evidence on the point is unclear and it is only one piece of evidence on the topic. If the plaintiff could establish that the defendants were party to any deliberate destruction of this document so that it would not be available as evidence, it would have the benefit at the trial of a strong presumption that its contents would not have assisted the defendant: Research in Motion Ltd v Samsung Electronics Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 320 ; (2009) 255 ALR 508. There is no particular likelihood that there could not be a fair trial of the action if the defendants have not done what they should have done to have discovered the cash-flow forecast. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] SASC 11">The Master expressed the view that under the 1987 Rules which presently govern the District Court action, it probably was necessary to plead the issue. However in the light of the decision of the Federal Court of Australia in Research in Motion Ltd v Samsung Electronics Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 320 , (2009) 176 FCR 66 , he considered that, at the very least, notice of the allegation should be given to the defendant and that such notice had not been given. He directed that notice be given by the plaintiffs of their case based on spoliation by 15 January 2010.  LIDDELL &amp; ANOR v SOUTHERN AREA HEALTH SERVICE [2010] SASC 11 (20 January 2010)
