<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 631">The irregularity in the petition however can be cured by amendment and an amendment was foreshadowed during the course of the argument in this case. Whether the Court should allow an amendment or not, of course, is a question of discretion and a relevant factor will be the prejudice to each of the parties if the amendment is permitted or refused as the case maybe. Additionally, the efficacy of the amendment needs to be taken into account and, as the cases demonstrate, the reason for the failure to disclose the security is of some importance as well. If the failure to disclose the security in the petition was properly characterised as inadvertent then a grant of leave will be more easily forthcoming. If the Court forms the view that the failure to disclose the security was deliberate, by reason of some misunderstanding of the law for example, then a grant of leave is not likely to be forthcoming: In re a Debtor (1977) 1 WLR 1308 and, again, Rares J in Wright Designed Pty Limited (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) v McClymont , (2006) FCA 999.  However, a secured creditor may present a petition as if he or she were an unsecured creditor if the secured creditor complies with s.44(3) of the Bankruptcy Act . Rather than attempt to explain the scheme of the Act and ss.44(3) , (4), (5) and (6) in my own words I can do no better, with respect, than the judgment of Rares J in Wright Designed Pty Limited (Subject to Deed of Arrangement) v McClymont (2006) FCA 999 , wherein his Honour says this: 21. Section 44(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) provides that subject to s 44(3) a secured creditor shall, for the purposes of s 44(1)(a) , be deemed to be a creditor only to the extent, if any, by which the amount of the debt owing to him or her exceeds the value of his or her security. And s 44(3) provides that a secured creditor may present or join in presenting a creditor's petition as if he or she were an unsecured creditor if they include in the petition a statement they are willing to surrender the security for the benefit of creditors generally in the event of a sequestration order being made against the debtor. Moreover, s 44(4) provides that where a petitioning creditor is a secured creditor, they must set out in the petition particulars of the security. 22. Wright Designed [and here it is just as easy to substitute the petitioning creditor's name, Allied Mills Pty Limited] argued that by reason of s 44(5) a secured creditor could present a creditor's petition as if an unsecured creditor and that if it did so the trustee, within three months after making the sequestration order can require it to surrender its security to the trustee for the benefit of creditors generally. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1415">The Court has been referred to Wright Designed Pty Ltd v McClymont [2006] FCA 999 per Rares J. In that matter, Mr &amp; Mrs McClymont engaged the Wright Designed under two contracts to do work in their home unit. Mr &amp; Mrs McClymont charged their property in favour of Wright Designed as equitable mortgagee to secure payment of all amounts to be paid by them under the contract. The Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal of New South Wales made a money order against the McClymonts which was subsequently registered by the Local Court of New South Wales as a judgment in favour of Wright Designed. The Supreme Court of New South Wales registered two judgments for costs, one in favour of Wright Designed and the other in favour of a director of Wright Designed. However no amount was paid in respect of either judgment. Wright Designed issued a Bankruptcy Notice seeking payment of the outstanding Local Court judgment debt and an act of bankruptcy was subsequently committed by Mr and Mrs McClymont. A Creditor's Petition which relied on that act of bankruptcy was served. Mr and Mrs McClymont opposed the making of the sequestration order on grounds including that the Petition incorrectly alleged that Wright Designed did not hold security over their property. </sentence>
