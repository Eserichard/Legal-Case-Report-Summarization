<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 77">In terms of costs, it is sufficient to repeat the observations of Finn J in McKenzie v State of South Australia [2006] FCA 891 ( McKenzie v State of South Australia ) at [6] , where his Honour stated: 
 
 The Court has a general discretion under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to make cost orders. The principles informing the Court's discretion in such cases are well known: see e.g. Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 155 FCR 229 at par 234. However, when costs are sought in discontinuance proceedings, somewhat different considerations obtain to those that obtain under s 43. It has been recognised that the underlying policy of the Rules is that the discontinuing party should be liable to pay the other party's costs unless the Court orders otherwise: see e.g. Grundy v Lewis [1998] FCA 563. That policy, though, has not itself solidified into a principle which parallels the usual rule under s 43 of costs following the event. The Courts have indicated that, on a motion for discontinuance, the conduct of the parties in the matter and the reasons for the discontinuance can bear heavily on the exercise of the discretion as to costs: see O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1680 at par [13] .

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 993">Ankamuthi was followed in McKenzie v South Australia [2006] FCA 891 and Roe v Kimberley Land Council Aboriginal Corporation [2010] FCA 809. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 828">Ankamuthi [2002] FCA 897 ; (2002) 121 FCR 68 was followed by Finn J in McKenzie [2006] FCA 891 where a notice of motion was filed by the applicants to a native title determination application to discontinue the proceedings. The authority of the applicants in that case to do so was not contested in the proceedings, and his Honour made orders granting leave to discontinue pursuant to O 22 r 2(2) of the Federal Court Rules .  Such further or other orders as the court considers fit. Because of the applicant's representative position with respect to a native title claim group, leave of the court is required in order to discontinue a native title proceeding: O 22 r 2(2) of the Federal Court Rules , Ankamuthi People v State of Queensland [2002] FCA 897 ; (2002) 121 FCR 68 and McKenzie v State of South Australia [2006] FCA 891. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 659">23 However, they held that s 85A(2) of the Act puts beyond doubt the extent of the Court's discretion in cases where a party has acted unreasonably. That provision does not control or limit the discretion available to the Court under s 85A(1). Their Honours held that the matters to be taken into account in making a costs order were left to the Court's discretion, which had to be exercised judicially. They said that the starting point was that each party would bear its own costs unless the Court determined that it was appropriate in the circumstances to make an order for costs. They emphasised that the starting point was not that costs ordinarily followed the event. Their Honours followed what Lee J had said at first instance in Ward v Western Australia [1999] FCA 580 ; (1999) 93 FCR 305 at 311-312 [31] - [37]. A similar approach has been taken in McKenzie v South Australia [2006] FCA 891 at [8] per Finn J and Reid v South Australia [2007] FCA 1479 at [53] - [54] per Finn J. In Reid [2007] FCA 1479 at [54] Finn J said that it is not proper to use the power to award costs to punish either a successful or unsuccessful party or to use it to operate as a deterrent to other would-be applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1479">61 I do not go so far as to say that, where a strike out motion is brought, a native title claimant is entitled as of course to have that motion determined without fear of an adverse costs order: cf McKenzie [2006] FCA 891 where costs orders were made on an application to discontinue under the shadow of an apprehended strike out motion. Each case must depend on its own circumstances. In the present matter I attribute particular importance to Mr Reid's being an unrepresented person who received spasmodic legal and other assistance which clearly was unequal to the challenge presented by the strike out motion; the motion was brought within a very short period after the filing of the application and the matter was dealt with expeditiously because of its potential to impact on the overlap proceedings. Mr Reid did not capitulate in the face of the flaws indicated to him by the State. He clearly erred in so doing. On balance, though, I do not consider that he so unreasonably caused the State and the ALRM to incur costs in connection with the conduct of the proceeding, or otherwise so acted as to warrant an adverse costs order. 

53 In McKenzie v State of South Australia [2006] FCA 891 at [8] I referred to the case law on s 85A. Here I need only repeat what I said there:
 
 "The most authoritative statement of the matters which should inform the exercise of discretion in awarding costs in light of this section was given by Lee J in Ward v Western Australia [1999] FCA 580 ; (1999) 93 FCR 305 , in comments later endorsed by the Full Court in De Rose v State of South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 137. His Honour noted first, that s 85A(1) is intended to remove the expectation that costs will follow the event but that despite this, the Court retains its discretion as to costs unlimited by subrule (1); secondly the 'unreasonable conduct' of the parties is not a jurisdictional fact which preconditions the exercise of the discretion and, conversely, s 85A(2) will not control or limit the discretion in subrule (1); thirdly, whilst the exercise of the discretion when making a costs order should be judicial, the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs.
