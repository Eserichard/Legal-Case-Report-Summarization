<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 388">As is apparent, fast track statements and responses are used instead of, or in substitution of, pleadings. They serve the same purpose as pleadings --- to clearly define the issues to be tried, and to allow the other party an opportunity to know the case against them. In my view, they fall within the "inclusory nature of the definition of "pleading"" in the Rules: cf WR Carpenter Holdings Pty Ltd (ACN 008 401 796) v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1252 ; (2006) 234 ALR 451 at [35] . </sentence>

The rule is not an exhaustive statement of the powers of the Court: W R Carpenter Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1252 , 234 ALR 451.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 635">Section 136AD(3)(c) is concerned with the consideration in respect of the acquisition of particular property. The proper application of s 136AD requires that the deemed arm's length consideration be determined in respect of the acquisition of the particular property by considering the arm's length consideration as 'an objective fact in the real world': see WR Carpenter Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1252 ; (2006) 234 ALR 451 , at [20] per Lindgren J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] HCA 33">The situation sufficiently appears from the following passage in the reasons of the primary judge [20] : 

 
"In the case of the 1987 assessment, the subject of the [Holdings] proceeding, that transaction has been called the 'CHIL Transaction'. What is particularly important, for an understanding of the issues that arose on the motions of the appellants, is the following passage in the reasons of Lindgren J [18] : 

 
 "The question is whether the [C]ommissioner must provide particulars, not of something on which he relies, but with a view to equipping the taxpayers with information on the basis of which they may be able to bring down the determinations and thereby establish that the assessments are excessive. What on the applications for particulars the primary judge called "the real issues" on the Pt IVC appeals [30] cannot include the requirement of any investigation or consideration by the Commissioner of these matters of motive and purpose when making the determinations under par (d) of s 136AD(1). These appeals from the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia (Heerey, Stone and Edmonds JJ) [1] , dismissing appeals brought by leave from an interlocutory decision of Lindgren J [2] , were heard together. Lindgren J observed that this requirement was introduced in part "for a practical reason", namely "that the court should know, at the earliest time practicable, the nature of the real issues in a tax appeal" [17] . The motions were dismissed by Lindgren J on 20 September 2006 [13] and appeals to the Full Court were dismissed on 11 July 2007. Lindgren J considered that while the Federal Court Rules ("the Rules") make no applicable provision for the giving of particulars in Pt IVC proceedings, the Federal Court has an inherent power to order particulars in such cases [14] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 441">95 The issue of the determination was not specifically dealt with by the Full Court in Sleight [2004] FCAFC 94 ; 136 FCR 211 but nevertheless Hill J (with whom Hely and Carr JJ concurred) observed at [107] that defects in the making of an assessment including a Pt IVA determination are not open to challenge by the taxpayer. For this conclusion Hill J relied on the conclusive nature of s 175 and s 177 of the Act and also referred to WR Carpenter Holdings Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1252 ; (2006) 63 ATR 577 which was approved on appeal WR Carpenter Holdings Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 103 ; (2007) 161 FCR 1. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 395">6 Before the primary judge, McDonald's relied, for its contention that a defence to its applications was bound to fail, upon the contents of appeal statements filed by the respondent Commissioner pursuant to O 52B r 5 of the Federal Court Rules . The requirement imposed by that rule is to file a statement which is described by O 52B r 5(3) as 'a statement outlining succinctly the Commissioner's contentions and the facts and issues in the appeal as the Commissioner perceives them' . An appeal statement is not a pleading (see the definition of 'pleading' in O 1 r 4; see also WR Carpenter Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [2006] FCA 1252 ; (2006) 234 ALR 451). Even if it was, it would not be sufficient to rely simply upon pleading points to satisfy s 31A where there was any prospect that leave might be granted to state a respectable basis for defending proceedings (see also Rio Tinto Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [2004] FCA 335 ; (2004) 55 ATR 321 ; BAE Systems Australia (NSW) Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation for the Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 48). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 48">18 His Honour did not suggest that in taking the place of pleadings, the statement should be treated in the same way as pleadings. The difference between pleadings and a statement of facts, issues and contentions or an appeal statement was recognised by Lindgren J in WR Carpenter Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1252 ; (2006) 234 ALR 451 where his Honour stated unequivocally, at 459, that a statement of facts, issues and contentions is not a pleading even within the extended definition of "pleading" in O 1 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules . </sentence>
