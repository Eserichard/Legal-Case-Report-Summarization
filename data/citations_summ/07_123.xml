<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 286">15 One question that was not expressly dealt with in the cases referred to above is whether a dismissal on the basis of a lack of jurisdiction is a final or an interlocutory order. The Full Court of this Court has held that such an order is an interlocutory order: '....at least where the order does not necessarily finally dispose of the rights of the parties. ': see Applicant NAGM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 395 at [6] (' NAGM ') and Mentyn v Westpac Banking Corporation [2004] FCAFC 149 at [3] . See also SZECK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 283 per Merkell J at [31] to [37] cf [38]. However, there has been a number of decisions of judges of this court that have held that a dismissal for want of jurisdiction is a final order: see MZXIW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 123 at [3] , NADZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 975 at [29] , MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 507 at [18] and MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 466 at [6] . In my view there is no conflict between these two sets of decisions because the latter all appeared to me to rely upon the High Court's decision in Anshun as explained by the Full Court in Egglishaw and therefore concluded that the order at issue finally disposed of the rights of the parties within the qualification expressed by the Full Court in NAGM (see above).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 178">6 There are a number of decision of the Court which, in different circumstances, treat summary dismissal as an interlocutory judgment or as a final judgment: cf SYWB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 402 ; MZWHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 491 with NADZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 975 ; MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 507 ; MZXIW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 123 ; MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 466. </sentence>
