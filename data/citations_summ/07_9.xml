<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 156">But as Stone J explained in SZCBT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 at [26] , the direction in Wu Shan Liang is no licence to excuse ambiguity, or for that matter lack of comprehension, in a Tribunal decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 990">Of course, as Mr Poynder submits, this does not mean that the Court can read into the letter something that is simply not there. In this sense a "beneficial" reading is not meant to resolve any ambiguity in the decision maker's favour.

The Court applies those decisions. 
As decided by the Full Court in SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46: 
 
 The test for relocation is whether it is practicable in the particular circumstances of the particular applicant (SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 40 ; (2007) 233 CLR 18 at [24] ; and SZFDV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 41 ; (2007) 233 CLR 51). The answer to that question in turn depends upon the framework set by the particular objections raised to relocation: Randhawa [1994] FCA 1253 ; 52 FCR 437 at 442---443, especially at 443C---D. 

 We do not think that the decision of Stone J in SZCBT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 dictates any different result. In our view, the result in that case turned on its own facts. Of particular importance in that case was the acceptance by the Tribunal that the applicant had been harassed in the past as he had alleged.

38 Later, in SZCBT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 , Stone J had cause to deal with similar considerations as follows at [26]:
 
 
 "[26] The Minister urged a 'beneficial' construction of the Tribunal's reasons and referred to comments made in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 , in particular at 271-272. The phrase 'beneficial construction', as used in Wu Shan Liang has a specific meaning, and was certainly not intended to mean that any ambiguity in the Tribunal's reasons be resolved in the Tribunal's favour. Rather, the construction of the Tribunal's reasons should be beneficial in the sense that the Tribunal's reasons would not be over-zealously scrutinised, with an eye attuned to error. In this sense a 'beneficial' approach to the Tribunal's reasons does not require this Court to assume that a vital issue was addressed when there is no evidence of this and, indeed, the general thrust of the Tribunal's comments suggest that the issue was overlooked. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 1073">It is the case that the High Court has said that Tribunal decisions should not be: "construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error" (at [30]). I also note what was said by Stone J in SZCBT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 at [26] : "The Minister urged a 'beneficial' construction of the Tribunal's reasons and referred to comments made in Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang in particular at 271 --- 272.

That is not to say, as was cautioned by Stone J in SZCBT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 that a beneficial construction, or reading, of a Tribunal's decision involves reading into it things that are simply not there. This point was emphasised recently by the Full Federal Court in Lafu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 140. (See in particular at [48], and the reference to Tickner v Chapman (1995) 57 FCR 451. ) </sentence>

In SZMCD the Full Court also considered what was said in SZCBT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 (" SZCBT "): "125. We do not think that the decision of Stone J in SZCBT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 dictates any different result. In our view the result in that case turned on its own facts. Of particular importance in that case was the acceptance by the Tribunal that the applicant had been harassed in the past as he had alleged. 126. In the present case, the Tribunal rejected all of the applicant's claims of past harm and there was no basis for the Tribunal to speculate that the appellant may be harmed if he relocated".

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 771">Nor, on the other hand, should a "beneficial reading" of a Tribunal decision be taken to mean that any ambiguity in the Tribunal's decision record be construed in favour of the Tribunal ( SZCBT v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 per Stone J at [26]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 651">I am also mindful of what was, relevantly, said by Stone J in SZCBT v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 at [26] (" SZCBT "): "The Minister urged a 'beneficial' construction of the Tribunal's reasons and referred to comments made in Minister of Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang in particular at 271 --- 272.

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FCA 95">The parties proceeded on the common basis that resolution of the appeal required the Tribunal's reasons to be considered but that, in so doing, over-zealous scrutiny with an "eye keenly attuned to the perception of error" should be avoided (citing Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang and Others [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271 --- 272). The appellant also observed that this required consideration of the whole of the Tribunal's reasons rather than any assumption that "ambiguity in the Tribunal's reasons be resolved in the Tribunal's favour" ( SZCBT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 at [26] ). Further, that this was not a case of ambiguity in the expression of reasons; rather, consideration of the whole of the Tribunal's reasons disclose that the Tribunal misunderstood and misapplied the principles set out in Erduran and thus asked itself the wrong question. </sentence>

In SZBKQ the Tribunal reasoned that the applicant could avoid the risk of harm by relocating to an area where she was not known and where her Roma ethnicity would not be apparent, that is, she could avoid the risk of harm by hiding her ethnicity. In SZCBT the Tribunal had found that the appellant had a reputation as a troublemaker (because of his letter writing) and that it was likely that this was at the root of his past treatment. That being so, the Court held, it was not sufficient to find that those responsible for that treatment would not seek him out in other parts of Egypt. It was necessary for the Tribunal to ask if the appellant is likely to continue with the conduct that marked him as a troublemaker in the past and, if so, whether that conduct would, in the future, evoke a similar response from others. It was not entitled to base its prediction on an expectation that the appellant would modify his behaviour on his return to his country. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs19" from="[2007] FMCA 511">
 
 16.

SZCBT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 , and my decision in SZGVQ v Minister [2006] FMCA 1005 at [35] and ff.). Nor do I consider that the Tribunal's reasoning shows it addressing the applicant's future risk of political persecution upon an assumption that he would modify his future conduct in the face of a threat of political persecution (cf. NBKT v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 195 at [65] and ff. ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2007] FMCA 461">It was also contended that, because of the jurisdictional errors in relation to the applicant's claim to fear persecution by reason of extortion attempts and membership of a particular social group, the Tribunal's relocation finding could not stand, given uncertainty as to whether the Tribunal properly considered whether the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Bangladesh (cf SZCBT v MIMA [2007] FCA 9 at [20] ).</sentence>
