<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 80">This appeal comes after a protracted process of decision-making, judicial review and appeals. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh. He entered Australia on a temporary business visa on 4 November 2004. On 14 December 2004 he lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (as it was then known). A delegate of the Minister refused this application on 31 January 2005. On 2 March 2005 the applicant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision. This application was refused on 29 June 2005. The appellant then applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for a review of this decision. The application was refused on 29 November 2006 but this refusal was subsequently overturned on an appeal to this court: see SZGZH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 486. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 220">In this regard the applicant was given the opportunity to set out the substrata of facts to his claims ( SZGZH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 486). In particular, also see CB 107.8 ("one of the things it could not follow about his claim ...") and CB 108.5 ("the Tribunal put to the applicant that ... found it difficult to understand him ... he was able to fly out of China ..."). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 219">However, the Applicant was entitled to be given any information not provided by him to the Tribunal and which may be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review in accordance with s.424A of the Act. Graham J held that the information obtained by the Tribunal from Dr Deva was information that enlivened the obligations of s.424A of the Act SZGZH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 486. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 538">Counsel for the first respondent then referred the Court to the decision of Graham J of the Federal Court of Australia on appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing the Applicant's application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal dated 29 June 2009 and handed down on 21 July 2005. Graham J found that the Refugee Review Tribunal was bound to give particulars of the information gleaned from Dr Deva to the applicant in writing and invite his comment upon it, in accordance with s.424A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (" the Act ") ( SZGZH v Minister for Immigraiton and Citizenship [2007] FCA 486 at [21] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 1522">57. I should just note, the applicant's written submissions of 1 March 2007 make reference to three "high Courts (sic) decisions" without specifically seeking to link those cases to his complaint. In any event, in the case of SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 and SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 , it is clear that the applicant's reference here is to support his complaint relating to the ground alleging failure to comply with s.424A of the Act. This has been dealt with above. The applicant's reference to SZGZH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 486 (" SZGZH ") is a reference to the judgment of the Federal Court on appeal from one of my judgments which was upheld. That case did involve a failure to comply with s.424A(1) of the Act and related to information obtained by the Tribunal from a third party, which the Court on appeal found was a part of the Tribunal's reasons for affirming the decision under review, and did not fall with the exception contained in s.424A(3)(b). This is clearly not the case in the matter currently before the Court. The facts in SZGZH are clearly distinguishable from the facts in the case before me now. The applicant has not pointed to, nor is it apparent on the material before the Court, that the Tribunal relied on any information provided by a third party and which did not fall within the exceptions contained within s.424A(3) of the Act.</sentence>
