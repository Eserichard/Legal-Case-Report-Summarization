<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 914">It is the case that in Nassif Branson J concluded (as pointed out in Liang at [15]) that it was " not a characteristic of the meaning of the word "business" that a business could only be carried on by one legal entity " . Jagot J summarised the relevant findings in Nassif and Liang in Ibrahim v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1328 (at [27]) as follows: ...In Nassif Branson J found that the Tribunal had erred in its approach to the identification of the business because it treated that description as necessarily involving a single entity only. While the applicant in that case had identified one business name in the application form the accompanying documents showed his involvement in numerous companies. His submissions contended that the applicant's business was transacted through at least four companies. Branson J found that the Tribunal erred by failing to deal with the applicant's case as put on the basis that a business may involve more than one legal entity. In Liang Logan J held that a single legal entity may conduct more than one business. Neither case turned on a conclusion that the Tribunal had taken into account irrelevant considerations. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 323">Thus, while a Tribunal's failure to reach an express conclusion about the authenticity of corroborative documents and how they might be weighed against other evidence could in some circumstances constitute a jurisdictional error as a failure to " engage " with a claim (see SZLGP ), in this case it did not impact on the result of the decision in a manner constituting jurisdictional error in the sense considered in Craig v The State of South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163 ; [1995] HCA 58 (see Ibrahim v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1328 at [38] ) . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 185"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1157">In any event, I accept the submission by counsel for the First Respondent, that effective state protection was a finding independent of the Tribunal's findings and conclusion that the applicants' fear was not well-founded and that the Applicant did not face a real chance of persecution if he were to return to Fiji for any Convention related reason. Further, I accept the submission of counsel for the First Respondent that, even if the Tribunal had committed an error in relation to its consideration of effective state protection, it was immaterial to the Tribunal's ultimate conclusion, as referred to above, and is therefore within jurisdiction ( Ibrahim v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1328 at [10] - [14]). </sentence>
