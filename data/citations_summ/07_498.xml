<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWSC 186">58 Parkview said, in submissions in reply, that s 447A provides a basis for avoidance ab initio of a deed of company arrangement. That may be so. I referred to that (or a like) possibility in Kyle House Pty Ltd v ACN 000 016 213 Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 224 at [17] . Termination ab initio probably stands in the same light as variation, something that can undoubtedly be achieved through s 447A: see, most recently, Hughes; Re Croesus Mining NL [2007] FCA 498. The problem for Parkview is that it did not present its case on the basis of s 447A. </sentence>
