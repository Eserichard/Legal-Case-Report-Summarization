<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VSC 100">[2] Where there has been proper disclosure in the explanatory statement, it should be assumed that shareholders have been properly informed in making their decision, [3] and that the court is reluctant to interfere with the commercial judgment of the shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 484">The third matter is the presence in the scheme of a "no incumbrances" provision. Provisions of this kind have been the subject of a number of decisions, stemming from Lindgren J's decision in Re WebCentral Group Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1203 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 742 ( WebCentral ). I followed WebCentral in the cases of Re Metals Exploration Limited [2007] FCA 84 and Re Uranium King Limited (No 3) [2008] FCA 1196 ; (2008) 67 ACSR 513. The concern in relation to the "no incumbrances" clauses, the subject of those decisions, was that third party interests might be affected by the presence of such a clause. However, in the case of Re Investa Properties Limited [2007] FCA 1104 ( Investa Properties ), Lindgren J considered whether the inclusion of the words "to the extent permitted by law" at the commencement of the "no incumbrances" clause would be sufficient to overcome the potential difficulties for third parties. </sentence>
