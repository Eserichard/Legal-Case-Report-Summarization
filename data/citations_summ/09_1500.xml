<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 448">As well, several recent authorities in this Court provide useful guidance on the interpretation and application of s 31A. In Helal v McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 1462 , I referred to the reasons of Kenny J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Southgate Investments Funds Limited [2010] FCA 1298 , which adopted, at [22], the observations of Sundberg J in Adnunat Pty Ltd v ITW Construction Systems Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 499 , at [37], as indicating how s 31A should be applied. In my assessment of these proceedings I have also considered the useful summary provided by Gilmour J in Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 (" Dandaven ") at [5] and [6] which was relied on by Foster J in Wang v Anying Group Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1500 , at [44]. In Dandaven, Gilmour J said: Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1098">In Reasons No 1 the primary judge outlined the approach to be taken on an application for summary judgment as follows: 
 
 59 Before considering the particular issues in this matter, it is convenient to mention how the exercise of the power conferred by s 31A should be approached. In the present case, the question is whether any of the respondents have no reasonable prospect of defending the proceedings or any part of the proceedings. How this question should be answered was recently discussed by Foster J in Wang v Anying Group Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1500 at [43] : 
 

 
 
 The critical words of s 31A(1), when applied to the present case, require me to be satisfied that the respondents have "... no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding ...". The following principles may be extracted from the authorities: 
 

 
 
 (a) The moving party does not have to demonstrate that the defence is hopeless or unarguable; 
 

 
 
 (b) The Court must consider the pleadings and the evidence with a "critical eye" in order to see whether the respondent party has evidence of sufficient quality and weight to be able to succeed at trial ( Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 at [23] (p 382) (per Finkelstein J)); 
 

 
 
 (c) The respondent party is not obliged to present its whole case in order to defeat the summary judgment applicant but must at least present a sufficient outline of the evidence in order to enable the Court to come to a preliminary view about the merits for the purpose of considering the statutory test in s 31A(1)(b) ( Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; 167 FCR 372 at [22] (p 382) (per Finkelstein J)); and 
 
 
 
 
 (d) The test may require greater scrutiny of the pleadings and evidence in some cases than in others. In my judgment, the words of s 31A(1) compel a flexible approach.</sentence>

 (d) The test may require greater scrutiny of the pleadings and evidence in some cases than in others. In my judgment, the words of s 31A(1) compel a flexible approach. The real question in every case is not so much whether there is any issue that could arguably go to trial but rather whether there is any issue that should be permitted to go to trial. This seems to be the approach of Finkelstein J in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; 167 FCR 372 and of Gordon J in the same case (as to which see [123]---[134] (pp 406---409)), although Rares J in that case at [73]---[74] (p 394) and in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 esp at [45] (p 731) favoured a test which is much closer to the older test articulated in authorities decided under Rules of Court expressed in terms different from the language of s 31A(1)).
