<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWIRComm 1014">43 Ms Winklemann referred to the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court ( Moore J dissenting) in Ramsay Butchering Services Pty Limited v Blackadder in contending there was no obligation on Principal to provide work to Ms Standen. If reliance is placed on the case, it may be noted that, in unanimously allowing an appeal against the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court, the High Court made various comments which would not assist the case argued by Principal: Blackadder v Ramsey Butchering Services Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 22 ; 221 CLR 539. For example, Kirby J said at [33] an order for reinstatement of an employee is meant to be "real and practical, not illusory and theoretical". Here, the practical reality was that Ms Standen had no work or wages - no real job at all - from 8 October 2008, and no practical prospect of being allowed to return to work with Principal given her injury status. Similarly, in Unsworth v Tristar Steering and Suspension Australia Limited [2008] FCA 1224 at [29] Gyles J cited the decision of the High Court in Blackadder, as well as Squires v Flight Stewards Assn of Australia (1982) 2 IR 155 at 164 and Downe v Sydney West Area Health Service (No 2) [2008] NSWSC 159 at [410] - [431], in observing: "There is a respectable argument that an employee cannot be indefinitely denied work to do if work of an appropriate kind is available".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1470">71 The same may be said of each of the other decisions discussed above. Only one decision requires further comment, being Tristar [2008] FCA 1224. Tristar too concerned one provision only, s 793(1)(i). It also, as Gyles J said, involved an unusual claim of discrimination by reason of not being terminated. The outcome in Tristar appears to have turned on its own unusual facts. Insofar as Gyles J expressed general views about the operation of the statutory provisions, the observations in Community and Public Sector Union (2006) 157 IR 470 ; [2006] FCAFC 176 at [43] --- [46] about McIlwain (2006) 154 IR 111 ; [2006] FCA 828 and National Union of Workers v Qenos Pty Ltd (2001) 108 FCR 90 ; [2001] FCA 178 are arguably to the contrary. Finally, the decision in Tristar is subject to an unresolved appeal.  62 Gyles J, in Unsworth v Tristar Steering and Suspension Australia Limited [2008] FCA 1224 , had to deal with the application of s 793(1)(i) in what his Honour described as an unusual situation of a claim of discrimination by employees who had not been dismissed from employment. At [20] Gyles J said that:
 It will be observed that object (b) of s 778 picks up the words "discriminated against" or "victimised" that have traditionally been used in this field. In my opinion, as the provisions now stand, taken in context, s 792 can have no sensible operation unless it involves discrimination against, or victimisation of, an employee on some basis connected with union membership, no matter how broadly. </sentence>
