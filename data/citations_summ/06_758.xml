<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1323">In each of the cases referred to by the plaintiffs, the Court undertook this exercise and considered the existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause to be a significant factor. However, while it may be the critical factor in a particular case, it is not always decisive: Slater &amp; Gordon Pty Ltd v Porteous [2005] VSC 398 at [26] ; World Firefighters Games Brisbane v World Firefighters Games Western Australia Inc [2001] QSC 164 ; (2001) 161 FLR 355 at [33] and [60] ( World Firefighters Games Brisbane ) and Safe Effect Technologies Ltd v Hood Group Holdings [2006] FCA 758 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 684 at [25] . As stated by Philippides J in World Firefighters Games Brisbane 161 FLR at [38]: 
 
 
 The authorities favour the view that under the cross-vesting legislation, the exclusive jurisdiction clause remains a relevant consideration, on the basis that the "interests of justice" require that due acknowledgment be accorded to such a clause as representing the bargain between the parties and that proper regard be given to the need to hold parties to their bargain. Nevertheless ... one should not start from the position that such clauses should be viewed with the "strong bias" in their favour previously accorded to them at common law. The weight to be given to such clauses will vary depending on the other surrounding and countervailing circumstances.
