<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 593">The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister not to grant the applicants Business Skills --- Established Business (Residence)(Class BH) visas. The matter was before me in 2007 in relation to an earlier decision of the Tribunal [1] . The applicants successfully appealed against that decision in the Federal Court [2] . The applicants now seek review of the further Tribunal decision made following the decision of the Federal Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1683">It is the Minister's submission that the Tribunal erred in its understanding of the effect of Lander J's decision in Ibrahim , and that misunderstanding caused it to fall into jurisdictional error in its consideration of whether or not the first respondent met the requirements of cl. 845.214. I am satisfied that the references to cl 845.214 in [43] and [44] are indeed typographical errors, as Mr Potts submitted, and the correct reference should be cl 845.215. In reading the decision as a whole, it is clear that the case before his Honour concerned cl. 845.215: 
 [4] The criteria which must be established to satisfy the grant of a subclass 845 visa is contained in cl 845 of Schedule 2 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (the Regulations). Relevantly, for the purpose of this application, cl 845.215 provided: 
 
 The total value of the net assets owned by the applicant, or by the applicant and the applicant's spouse together, in the main business or main businesses in Australia: 
 is; and has been throughout the period of 12 months immediately preceding the making of the application; 
 at least AUD$100,000. [7] 
  The Tribunal then went on to consider the decision of Lander J in Ibrahim v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [3] at [44]-[50] and concluded: When the Tribunal applies Lander J's reasoning as set out above to the available evidence in this case, it is satisfied that the net assets of the first named applicant and his wife for the relevant periods were as detailed above. Although the Tribunal has concerns as to the source of the funds transferred into the bank account for K-Achieve International Pty Ltd, the financial statements and other evidence as indicated above clearly disclose that the net assets of the first named applicant and his wife had been throughout the period of 12 months immediately preceding the making of the application on 9 September 2005, at least AUD250,000.
