<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1220">Ultimately, as Weinberg J commented in ACCC v Australian Abalone Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1834 at [121] , where the parties have agreed on a penalty the real question is for the court which is not to be regarded as a "rubber stamp". The Court must independently consider what penalty should be imposed however, as Weinberg J added at [122]: 
 
 Nonetheless, it is a fact that in the vast majority of cases where pecuniary penalties have been agreed the Court has approved those penalties. That is because the Court is concerned only with whether the agreed penalties are within what is described as the "permissible range". Because the determination of a penalty is not an exact science, that range may be quite broad. If an agreed penalty is "within the range" the Court will generally give it effect. 
 
 Factors relevant to determining the amount of pecuniary penalty
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 65">34 In a later case, Weinberg J noted that a pecuniary penalty is intended to achieve, amongst other things, the goal of punishment: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Australian Abalone Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1834 at [116] . However, for my part, I entertain some doubt whether any element of a penalty should be to punish a contravener of provisions of the BCII Act. Rather, the penalty is imposed as a means of influencing the behaviour of those to whom the BCII Act applies if they do not conform with the norms of conduct the Act is intended to establish and maintain.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 58">In accepting a figure agreed between the parties the Court is not, and should not be regarded as, acting as a rubber stamp. The point was made by Weinberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Abalone Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1834 at [121] - [122]: 
 
 The real question is whether the pecuniary penalties which are now sought, and which have been agreed by the respondents, should be approved. In answering that question it must be emphasised that, in the final analysis, it is for the Court, and not the parties, to determine the amount of any pecuniary penalty. The Court is not to be regarded as a "rubber stamp". ... Nonetheless, it is a fact that in the vast majority of cases where pecuniary penalties have been agreed the Court has approved those penalties. That is because the Court is concerned only with whether the agreed penalties are within what is described as the "permissible range".

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 17"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1987">43 Of particular concern is the need to ensure that this Court is " not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties ": cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 at [18] , [1999] FCA 18 ; 161 ALR 79 at 86 per French J. The Court is not to be regarded as a " rubber stamp ": Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Abalone Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1834 at [121] , ATPR 42-199 per Weinberg J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1545">42 The requirement for the Court itself to be satisfied as to the appropriateness of a penalty is a responsibility which ultimately derives from s 71 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act and is not a responsibility which can be circumscribed by private agreement: cf Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Hobie Cat Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 402 at [19] per Finn J. And in discharging that responsibility in the context of the Therapeutic Goods Act the Court, as it is in the context of the Trade Practices Act when considering whether to make an order by consent, " is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties, it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so ": cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 at [18] , [1999] FCA 18 ; 161 ALR 79 at 86 per French J. The Court is not to be regarded as a " rubber stamp ": Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Australian Abalone Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1834 at [121] per Weinberg J
