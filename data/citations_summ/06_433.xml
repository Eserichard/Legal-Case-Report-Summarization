<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 1067">As case law makes clear (see, for example, Australian Securities and Investrments Commission v Australian Investors Forum Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 1180 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mauer-Swisse Securities Ltd [2002] NSWSC 684 ; (2002) 20 ACLC 1530 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 307) , the court's task in a case like this is to engage in a balancing exercise, weighing the benefits and detriments to the particular defendant against those to the "aggrieved persons" with whom s 1323 is concerned - in this case, the persons who may be entitled to compensation from the first defendant if and when any contravention of the insider trading provisions is proved against him. 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 1423">15 The next question, therefore, is whether I should conclude that it is either "necessary" or "desirable" to make an order "for the purpose of protecting the interests of" any such "person aggrieved". As posed by the legislation in the present case, this question relates to "an order appointing ... a receiver" of property of Mr Falconer and Dunbar, given that the order actually sought is a freezing order which, in the particular context, is permitted as an "alternative or lesser order": see Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; [2006] 57 ACSR 307 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Krecichwost [2007] NSWSC 948 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 411 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Banovec (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 961 ; (2007) 214 FLR 33 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Burnard [2007] NSWSC 1217 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 360. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] WASCA 109">8 On 20 April 2006, French J dealt with ASIC's application. While no final determinations were made, his Honour found that the evidence tendered by ASIC was indicative of serious misconduct in the affairs of the Westpoint Group companies and the 'very real possibility' that there had been breaches of the Corporations Act and other laws by persons involved in the group: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 232 ALR 577. In his opinion, it was necessary and desirable to make orders to protect potential claimants against the defendants in respect of liabilities which may be imposed upon them for contraventions of the Corporations Act and other statutes and for breaches of common law and fiduciary duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] NSWSC 606">9 I re-order the submissions advanced by Mr Stack, who appears for ASIC. Mr Stack submitted that the depletion of Mr Sigalla's net assets through the incurring of a liability was a dealing with his assets in breach of the order. He submitted that the purpose of the order was to preserve Mr Sigalla's assets against which a judgment creditor could retain recovery of a judgment debt (citing Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968); Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No. 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 57 ASCR 307 at [25] ). Mr Stack submitted this purpose would be defeated if debt were allowed to be incurred, which would increase the value of claims on the defendant's property and hence diminish a return in a bankruptcy. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] NSWSC 196">38 ASIC has instituted contempt proceedings against Sigalla. The charges are detailed in an amended statement of charge filed on 1 March 2010 alleging no fewer than forty-one contraventions of freezing orders made by the court against Sigalla in the ASIC proceedings. The application under s 1323 of the Corporations Act on which those orders were made no doubt sought the appointment of a receiver of Sigalla's assets and thereby became the vehicle for the making of freezing orders as a "less drastic remedy": Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 307. The forty-one contraventions of orders alleged by ASIC have yet to come before the court. I therefore do no more than note the ASIC allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 1425">Leave is sought to begin and carry on the proceeding. Leave is required because the respondent (Brighton Hall) is being wound up. The proceeding arises from the collapse of the Westpoint Group which has been well documented. Its activities are summarised in Australian Securities and Investments Commission, in the matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey [2006] FCA 366 and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 232 ALR 577. </sentence>

15 There follow various descriptions of orders. Among them are an order prohibiting the relevant person from leaving Australia without the consent of the court and an order appointing a receiver of all or some of the property of the relevant person. An asset preservation or freezing order is not among the types of orders referred to in s 1323(1), but it has been held in a number of cases that the power to appoint a receiver includes a power to make an asset preservation or freezing order as an "alternative or lesser order": see, for example, Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 307 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Krecichwost [2007] NSWSC 948 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 411 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Banovec (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 961 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1203 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Burnard [2007] NSWSC 1217 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 360. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 424">I do not accept the defendants' submissions. In my opinion the provisions of ss 76 and 77 when read together with s 83 provides a means for the admission of statements made at a s 19 examination but does not affect the admissibility otherwise whether under the general law or statute of such statements. Such a view has some support in the cases: ASIC v Elm Financial Services Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 306 at [12], Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; ASIC v Carey (No 3) (2006) 57 ACSR 307 ; [2006] FCA 433 at [35] - [36]. Sections 76 and 77 will often afford the only means for the admission of such statements but this will not always be the case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] NSWSC 34">
 


19 I turn now to the legal principles concerning freezing orders of the kind that can be made where the jurisdiction to appoint a receiver under s 1323 of the Corporations Act is enlivened (see Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 307 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Krecichwost [2007] NSWSC 948 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 411 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Banovec (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 961 ; (2007) 214 FLR 33 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Burnard [2007] NSWSC 1217 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 360). It is not suggested by the present applicants that the power to make a freezing order is not attracted in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1423">22 In an ordinary proceeding, this could not be admissible evidence of the serious allegation that Mr Hawley had falsified the clients' records. However, given what was said by French J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No. 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 232 ALR 577 at 588 [31] it seems that such statements of opinion can be received on an application under s 1323(1). Be that as it may, there are real difficulties in assessing the strength of ASIC's case against Mr Hawley because no direct evidence has been placed before the Court as to how ASIC makes good this allegation. 8 French J has described the function to be performed under s 1323(1) as essentially one of risk assessment and management: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No. 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 232 ALR 577 at 587 [26] and 588 [30]. It, therefore, involves balancing the interests, on the one hand, of the aggrieved persons referred to in s 1323(1) and, on the other hand, the interests of a respondent in avoiding undue interference in his or her affairs. Where, as here, it is sought to interfere with a person's freedom of movement, it is to be borne in mind that such a step is not lightly to be undertaken: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission; in the matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No. 19) [2008] FCA 38 ; (2008) 65 ACSR 421 at 427 at [32] per French J (and the authorities therein). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] NSWSC 855">6 In summary, ASIC put that the fundamental purpose of s 1323 is to preserve assets so as to enable ASIC to complete its investigations. Mr Stack cited, inter alia, ASIC v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 307 and ASIC v Burnard [2007] NSWSC 1217 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 360. Parliament's intention in enacting s 1323 was to enable the public interest to be served by freezing assets pending an investigation. Furthermore, Parliament specially said in s 1323(4) that ASIC was not required to give an undertaking as to damages, and under s 246(1)(a) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth), ASIC is exempted from liability for damages in relation to any act done or omitted in good faith in purported performance of the exercise of any power vested in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 381">1 The orders I made when these proceedings commenced were made on 20 April 2006 under the provisions of section 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth): Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 232 ALR 577. That section conditions the Court's power to make orders affecting the ability of a person or company to deal with their own assets where one of three conditions is satisfied:-
 
 
 (a) an investigation is being carried out under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ("ASIC Act") or under the Corporations Act in relation to an act or omission by a person, being an act or omission that constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the Corporations Act ; or
 (b) a prosecution has been begun against a person for a contravention of the Corporations Act ; or
 (c) a civil proceeding has been begun against a person under the Corporations Act .  

2 The orders made in April 2006 were based on the existence of specific investigations being carried out by the Plaintiff, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC"), under the ASIC Act . Those investigations were identified in the reasons for judgment at the time: ASIC v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 232 ALR 577. The process that has followed the making of those orders, which affected former officers of the Westpoint group and a number of companies in the group, has been long and rather convoluted. Additional parties have been joined. There have been incidental and collateral issues of a contentious nature to be determined. There have been variations and refinements of the orders as particular problems have arisen from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] NSWSC 1217">21 Three recent decisions support that view: see Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 307 (French J), Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Krecichwost [2007] NSWSC 948 (McDougall J) and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Banovec (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 961 (White J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FCA 1395">2 On 20 April 2006 receivers were appointed to the property of all of those named as defendants with exception of the seventh defendant, Bowesco Ltd which was subject to a private receiver appointed under a security. Freezing orders were made in relation to its property. The reasons for all the orders made were set out in Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 232 ALR 577. Those orders commenced a long and winding trail of interlocutory processes involving the ultimate joinder of four additional defendants, orders in respect of each of them, other than the eleventh defendant, and variations to make all of the orders more effective and to deal with practical difficulties encountered in their administration. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2007] NSWSC 961">Counsel submitted that there then followed detailed provisions in which the legislature established clear parameters to grant specific remedies against a defendant which entail the exercise of a "drastic power". Counsel submitted that there was the potential for the powers under s 1323 to operate oppressively. The exercise of jurisdiction under s 1323 involves a balancing exercise in the nature of risk assessment and risk management ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 307 at [26] ). Counsel submitted that:

" The thin veil that separates a proportionate remedy and balancing exercise from metamorphosing into oppression is twofold (a) discretion afforded to the Court to judge the evidence and adjust the remedy and (b) a defined parameter within which to permit the drastic remedy to operate . "

20 If s 1323 of the Act does not impliedly confer power on the Court to restrain a relevant person from dissipating his or her assets within the jurisdiction, it does not follow that such a power is not found elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2007] NSWSC 948">Thus, they submitted, it was subject to the well-known principles informing the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction in relation to freezing orders generally. See (by way of example only) Cardile v LED Builders Pty Limited (1999) 198 CLR 380 ; Patterson v BTR Engineering (Aust) Ltd (1989) 18 NSWLR 319 ; and Frigo v Culhaci (CA 17 July 1998 unreported; BC 9803225). Analysis: the statutory scheme 

22 In Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 307 , French J dealt at 316 [25] with the kinds of orders that can be made under s1323. His Honour noted that they were made to preserve the status quo pending investigation, and that they might be made even before evidence necessary to establish liability had been collected (or, for that matter, before liability itself had been established). His Honour said:

"[25] The orders that can be made under the section are directed, inter alia, to the preservation of assets against which recovery may be sought in the event that liability to an "aggrieved person" is established on the part of a "relevant person".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2007] NSWSC 610">18 I am satisfied that there are persons to whom the defendant is or may be or may become liable to make monetary compensation. In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey [2006] FCA 433 ; [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 307 , French J (at [26]) aptly described the task of deciding whether it is necessary or desirable to make an order under s 1323 to protect the interests of such persons as an exercise in risk assessment and risk management. It is not necessary for ASIC to demonstrate that there is a prima facie case that the defendant is liable to compensate affected persons. Nor is it necessary for it to show the defendant is likely to dissipate assets unless restrained, although these would be powerful discretionary considerations in favour of making an order under s 1323 ( ASIC v Adler (2001) 38 ACSR 266 at [7]; ASIC v Carey at [26]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2007] FCA 310">On 29 March 2006 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) filed an application in the Court seeking orders under s 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) against companies who were members of, or associated with, the Westpoint Group. Orders were also sought against officers and former officers of those companies. On 20 April 2006 receivers were appointed to the property of each of the defendants save for the seventh defendant, Bowesco Pty Ltd (Bowesco), which already had a private receivership in place. In the case of Bowesco freezing orders were made in relation to its property: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission; In the matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2007] FCA 35">4 On 20 April 2006 orders (Receiver Orders) were made on the application of ASIC under s 1323 of the Corporations Act appointing receivers to the property of a number of corporations and individuals associated with the Westpoint Group: Australian Securities and Investments Commission; In the matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; 57 ACSR 307. The application was brought in respect of the first to eighth defendants. The individuals against whom the orders were made were officers or former officers of companies in the Westpoint Group. Each of the individuals and companies in respect of whom receivers were appointed was required to produce affidavits setting out, inter alia, their assets and liabilities and the detail of property held by them. Travel restraint orders were made against the individual defendants. The Receiver Orders were not made against the seventh defendant, Bowesco Pty Ltd (Bowesco), as it had privately appointed receivers in place under a debenture. It was however the subject of an asset Preservation Order preventing disposition of its assets and requiring a detailed inventory of its assets and liabilities and of all its property in the same terms as required of the other defendants. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2007] FCAFC 1">15 On 20 April 2006, the trial judge also made orders for the appointment of receivers to the property of Mr Carey and three other persons associated with companies in the Westpoint group of companies, pursuant to s 1323 of the Corporations Act . The trial judge's reasons for decision are set out in Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433. </sentence>

The receivers appointed were Brian McMaster, Oren Zohar and Mark Korda.

Those orders were varied on 30 June 2006 and expressed to permit the Bowesco receivers appointed by Suncorp-Metway to exercise their powers pursuant to their appointment including their powers under s 420 of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2006] FCA 1242">On 20 April 2006 orders were made under s 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) and s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) restraining Bowesco Pty Ltd (Bowesco) from disposing of or dealing with its assets pending investigations being carried out by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission into matters relating to Bowesco and other companies associated with the Westpoint Property and Finance Group --- Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433 ; (2006) 57 ACSR 307. </sentence>

The orders were varied on 30 June 2006. They were expressed so as to permit the Bowesco receivers to exercise their powers pursuant to their appointment by Sunway-Metcorp, including their powers under s 420 of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2006] NSWSC 611">15 The discretion which I must exercise in an application of this character involves an assessment of the risk that an investigation may be frustrated, as against the hardships which the restraints sought may impose upon parties against whom no wrongdoing has yet been alleged. I bear in mind that, on ASIC's own evidence, Mr Burnard and his solicitors have demonstrated co-operation in ASIC's inquiries to date. Nevertheless, I also bear in mind that a very large sum of the public's money has been lost by what appears to have been serious mismanagement in Westpoint's affairs: ASIC v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433. I bear in mind that while co-operation may be demonstrated at early stages of an investigation by a person the subject of inquiry, that co-operation may evaporate as the investigation proceeds and the complexion of matters changes. I bear in mind that once a person is beyond the immediate jurisdiction of this Court because he or she has left the country, it is often very difficult to procure that person's return to face investigation and possible prosecution. </sentence>
