<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 58">Collier J also dealt with the question of the standard of proof in CFMEU v C E Marshall &amp; Sons Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 169 where her Honour said at [39] and [40]: "The case before me involves the application of civil remedy provisions, and penalties which can be awarded against the respondent if appropriate. In my view the issue raised by Mr Horneman-Wren may be addressed by recognising that the civil standard of proof - that is, the balance of probabilities --- is applicable as required by s 140(1) Evidence Act , however in applying the civil standard it is appropriate to take into account the issues prescribed in s 140(2). This does not mean that I am required to apply a higher standard of proof than the "mere balance of probabilities" as submitted by Counsel. It does, however, require me in this case, in applying the civil standard, to take into account the nature of the claim, the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and the gravity of the matters alleged. In particular in the context of a civil remedy provision, I take into account the fact and the nature of the penalties which can be awarded against the respondent. This approach is consistent with the approach taken by Nicholson J in Maritime Union of Australia 93 FCR at 65. The duty of the court in such cases to take into account issues specified in s 140(2) has also been recognised in other Federal Court decisions including The Employment Advocate v National Union of Workers [2000] FCA 710 ; (2000) 100 FCR 454 at 464 and Hamberger v CFMEU (2000) 104 IR 45 at 49. Accordingly, in my view the civil standard of balance of probabilities, prescribed by s 140(1) and (2) Evidence Act , applies in this case. " </sentence>
