<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1051">3 On 6 July 2006 I granted the appellant leave to file and serve out of time a notice of appeal from the decision of Jarrett FM, and leave to appeal from the decision of Jarrett FM: Gauci v Kennedy [2006] FCA 869. The background and facts of this matter are set out in that decision, and I explained in some detail principles referable to summary dismissal. It is unnecessary to repeat those principles here, other than to acknowledge that the power to dismiss an application summarily must be exercised with great caution and only in the clearest of cases.
  

24 Consideration of the issue whether the conduct of the first respondent did constitute sexual harassment within the meaning of s 28A SD Act did, in my view, give rise to a real question to be determined between the parties. In this respect, I repeat the observations I made in Gauci [2006] FCA 869 at [44] .
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1426">10 In my view, a decision of a Federal Magistrate dismissing an application pursuant to r 13.10 Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 is an interlocutory decision, requiring leave of the Federal Court to appeal: Rana v University of South Australia [2004] FCA 559 ; Gauci v Kennedy [2006] FCA 869. No leave to appeal has been sought. However this point in my view is moot because, as I indicated earlier in this judgment, both parties were of the view that the appeal be dismissed. The real issue before me is in relation to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FMCA 1251">It is clear, I think, that an order summarily dismissing a claim or a defence pursuant to FMCR 13.10 is interlocutory in nature [5] .</sentence>
