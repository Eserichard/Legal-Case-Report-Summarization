<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 353">In Smith as Judicial Manager of Australian Family Assurance Limited v Australian Family Assurance Limited [2009] FCA 1449 Lindgren J was of the view that a winding up order made by the Court as part of the process consequent upon receipt of a judicial manager's report was an order made under the Insurance Act but that it was "perhaps ... implicit that the Corporations Act 's winding up regime applies" (at [27]). As the Insurance Act then stood I can readily see how his Honour arrived at that conclusion and, with respect, it is one with which I agree. It does, however, give rise to practical problems in operation. An example of one of these is afforded by Part 5.7B of the Corporations Act . A number of its provisions deal with voidable transactions. There will be such a transaction if, at least, it occurred within a specified period of a date known as the "relation-back day": s 588FE. That day is defined in s 9 to be the day upon which a winding up is taken to have begun "because of Division 1A of Part 5.6 " but that division relevantly only refers to a winding up under ss 233 , 459A , 459B and 461 of the Corporations Act : s 513A . Consequently, it would appear --- if matters rested there --- that there is no relation-back day for a winding up under the Insurance Act . </sentence>
