<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1373">The prejudice which Mr Farrelly identified assumes that in order for him to be personally liable Solitaire had to establish that Mr Farrelly and Urban Ventures were joint tortfeasors in the sense that they acted in concert with one another pursuant to a common design in the infringement of Solitaire's copyright (relying on O'Brien v Dawson [1942] HCA 8 ; (1942) 66 CLR 18 at 32-33, WEA International Inc v Hanimex Corporation Ltd (1987) 17 FCR 274 at 283, CBS Songs Ltd v Amstrad Consumer Electronics Plc [1988] UKHL 15 ; [1988] AC 1013 at 1057, C Evans &amp; Sons Ltd v Spritebrand Ltd [1985] 2 All ER 415 at 424 and Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd (2009) 84 IPR 222 ; [2009] FCA 1495 at [620] - [624]). According to Mr Farrelly none of the circumstances for joint tortious liability as summarised in Aristocrat Technologies were satisfied, namely: 
 
 [620] As Gummow J explained in WEA International at 283, infringement of copyright statutes are considered tortious, so as to make applicable the common law principles of liability of joint tortfeasors. 
 

 
 
 [621] It is not sufficient to establish a claim of joint liability that two or more persons assisted or concurred in or contributed to a tortious act; what is required is that there be "some common design": WEA at 283.</sentence>
