<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 336">Whether or not a Court should exercise its discretion to extend the time for making an application has been considered in numerous cases: see Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 per Wilcox J; Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [21] - [24] per Weinberg J; and SZGCA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 224 at [4] per Besanko J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1043">18 Appeals from decisions of the Tribunal to this Court are confined to " a question of law " and are to be filed within 28 days: Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), s 44(1) and (2A)(a). Prima facie the rule is that proceedings commenced outside the prescribed 28 day period ought not to be entertained: Jeilles v Secretary, Department of Employment &amp; Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 1590 at [9] . There is, however, a discretion to extend that time. The principles relevant to that discretion have been conveniently set forth by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 and those principles have since been repeatedly applied in a variety of contexts in which an extension of time is sought: eg, Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria (No 4) [2007] FCA 1449 at [47] ---[48] [2007] FCA 1449 ; , 97 ALD 721 at 730; SZGCA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 224 at [4] .</sentence>
