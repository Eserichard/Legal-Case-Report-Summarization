<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1188">22 However, there is clear authority for the proposition that the appellant's case must be considered in the light of the law as it stood at the time of the visa cancellation. Both the delegate's decision and the MRT's decision to affirm that decision took place before the amendments came into effect. The appellant cannot call in aid the ameliorated version of the clause because it has no retrospective effect. See the decision of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Zhou [2006] FCAFC 96 ; (2006) 152 FCR 115 at [44] per Ryan, Nicholson and Lander JJ.
