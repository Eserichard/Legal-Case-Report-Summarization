<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 13">Ms Tronson relied on two further authorities. First, MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 ("MZXBQ") for the proposition that Heerey J's reasoning (at [27] to [28]) supports the argument that a "finding" that Wu'er Kaixi was not in Japan in 1991 was evidence of "dispositive relevance" to the applicant's claims. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 1007">It was submitted that s.424A required the Tribunal to assess the " information " in question in advance of its findings in terms of its dispositive relevance to the Convention claims advanced by the applicant ( SZBYR at [17]) and that such assessment did not depend on the Tribunal's subsequent use of the evidence in its reasons ( MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 166 FCR 438 ; [2008] FCA 319 at [27] per Heerey J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1053">Section 424A does not apply to information that the applicant has given the Tribunal for the purposes of the application under review: s 424A(3)(b). The reference to "information" in s 424AA and s 424A does not encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determination. Nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps: VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 ; (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 477 [24] per Finn and Stone JJ; SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at 616 [18] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ; MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 at 492 at [29] per Heerey J; Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZLFX [2009] HCA 31 ; (2009) 238 CLR 507 at 154 [25] per French CJ, Heydon, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ. As the High Court observed in SZBYR at [18]: 
 
 If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly "information" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation , not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 779">In relation to ground 1 above, his Honour found that the information did not evoke an obligation under s 424A(1) as the material did not fall within the meaning of "information" for the purposes of s 424A , relying on the High Court's decision in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 , [2007] HCA 26 at [17] to [18]. Furthermore, his Honour observed that the Tribunal ultimately accepted that the appellant's husband had died as a consequence of the quarry accident. It followed that the statements made by the appellant to the effect that her husband was alive was not ultimately " the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision" , relying on Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLFX (2009) 238 CLR 507 ; [2009] HCA 31 at [22] --- [26] and MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 ; [2008] FCA 319 per Heerey J at [27] --- [30]. </sentence>

The fact that some oral information given to the delegate might ultimately cast doubt on the applicant's credibility, whether generally or in relation to a specific issue, is not to the point. </sentence>

The fact that the delegate's concerns and findings were discussed in this manner at the hearing does not compel an inference that the Tribunal " considered " that the document examination results of the existence of similar claims " would " (not " could " or " might" as observed in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 166 FCR 438 ; [2008] FCA 319 and SZLFX at [25]) " be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review ". </sentence>

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FMCA 1077">The decision of Heerey J in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [26] at [27]-[29] contains a useful analysis of the decision in SZBYR. Conclusions 
  The High Court also considered the matter in SZLFX at [24] and [25]: As a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia (Dowsett, Bennett and Edmonds JJ) pointed out correctly, shortly after SZBYR, in SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, [28] s.424A depends on the RRT's "consideration", that is, its opinion, that certain information would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. Here, there was no evidence or necessary inference that the RRT had "considered" or had any opinion about the note. As observed equally correctly by Heerey J in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, [29] s.424A speaks of information which "would", not which "could" or "might", be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FMCA 713">I recently considered the question of what "would be" the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review for the purposes of s.424A in SZBJH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 473 (" SZBJH "). In that case the applicant relied on SZBYR at [17] and MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 , per Heerey J, to argue for the proposition that s.424A is engaged when the Tribunal becomes aware of information that "would be" the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review, and that the Court should therefore not have regard to the Tribunal's published reasons for its decision, as the "operation of section 424A(1)(a) is to be determined in advance -- and independently -- of the Tribunal's particular reasoning... ( SZBYR at [17]) (see SZBJH at [21] --- [22]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FMCA 842">In circumstances where the applicant denied knowledge of the details and information contained in the visitor visa application, it is apparent and both logical and reasonable that the Tribunal formed the view that it would not be appropriate to use the information in that application as the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. (Also note that in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 at [27] , Heerey J drew a distinction between " evidentiary material or documentation " which of itself would undermine the applicant's claims and enliven the obligation under s.424A(1) of the Migration Act and information which went only to an applicant's credibility). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] HCA 31">As observed equally correctly by Heerey J in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [15] , s 424A speaks of information which "would", not which "could" or "might", be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review.

<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FMCA 789">In those circumstances, I am not persuaded that it can be inferred that the Tribunal at the relevant time considered any aspect of the evidence of Father McGee to be a matter that would form part of its reason for affirming the decision under review (see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 at [22] ). I note the suggestion in SZBYR that the court should not seek to unbundle the reasoning of the Tribunal (and see MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 at [25] ). I also note that there is no suggestion that Father McGee's evidence was discussed at the hearing conducted by the Tribunal as reconstituted in a manner that might give rise to an inference that at any relevant time the Tribunal considered that it would be a reason, or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. I am not persuaded that the Tribunal' s s.424A obligations were enlivened in relation to any aspect of the evidence of Father McGee in these circumstances. </sentence>

Their Honours said that the effect of this is that s 424A(1) is only enlivened where the Tribunal forms the opinion that particular information would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. In MZXQB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 at [27], Heerey J described the test as one of "dispositive relevance". </sentence>

Post-SZBYR the correct approach would have been for the Tribunal to consider whether the $20,000 bond information, if true, would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision to refuse the appellant's protection visa application ..." </sentence>

On the construction accepted by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 , inconsistent or other statements made by an applicant to a delegate are not 'information' coming within s.424A(1) , if they are regarded merely as diminishing his credibility as a witness, and do not in themselves provide positive evidence which "in [its] terms [is] a rejection, denial or undermining of the [applicants'] claims to be persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations" (see SZBYR at [17], [18] and [21], as explained by Heerey J in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 at [29] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2009] FMCA 333">It must be said that there are some difficult questions about the drawing of an inference in relation to whether s.424A(1)(a) was enlivened where particular information was raised in some way at a Tribunal hearing but was not used in the Tribunal decision (see SZJZB , MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 and SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99). The mere fact that an issue was discussed in some way at a hearing should not of itself preclude the drawing of an inference that s.424A was not enlivened (see SZLPJ at [13]). Nor should it compel an inference that particular information " would be" the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2009] FMCA 281">This is that, whatever the Applicant might have been able to say about the status of BSS, it could not have overcome the Tribunal's lack of satisfaction that the Applicant met cl 457.223(a) and (f). That lack of satisfaction was itself enough to rule out a favourable decision; so that the decision-maker was 'bound by the governing statute to refuse' the application, irrespective of the suggested non-compliance with s 359A. [34] (The Tribunal's lack of satisfaction, of course, arose from perceived deficiencies in what the Applicant had put forward and was not itself the subject of an obligation under s 359A. ) Reasoning
 Did the Tribunal breach s.360 of the Migration Act ? </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2009] FMCA 175">SZBYR at [17]). The information drawn from the prior documents was not "information merely going to credibility" (cf. Heerey J in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 at [29] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2009] FCA 210">Even though the Tribunal sent a letter as if s 424A applied to the information, it was not obliged to do so. Section 424A was not engaged. The "information" that was given to the applicant was not information of the type that must be particularised and given to the applicant under s 424A(1)(a) of the Act. The information (namely the passport, which indicated that the appellant had previously travelled to a number of countries before returning to Pakistan and the Australian visitor visa) was not in itself, as Heerey J described in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 at [27] , of "dispositive relevance to the Convention claims advanced by the applicant" nor could such information be said to undermine the applicant's claim of having a well-founded fear of persecution. The information was neutral in character. It merely evidenced the fact that, firstly, the applicant had previously travelled to a number of countries before retuning to Pakistan and, secondly, that the applicant had been granted an Australian visitor visa. To adopt the language of the High Court in SZBYR , the information did not, in terms, constitute "a rejection, denial or undermining of the [applicant's claim to be a person] to whom Australia owed protection obligations": SZBYR at [17]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2009] FCA 209">Here, the information given by Ms L to the tribunal did not merely undermine the credibility of the appellant.

The information from Ms L undermined the appellant's claim, for the tribunal said it brought into question the level of communication between the two of them and, ultimately, but directly led to its conclusions that the relationship was not as he had claimed and his desire to remain in Australia was stronger than his desire to live with her and their child. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2009] FMCA 7">I reject the Minister's submission that the obligation of disclosure under s.359A only exists if ultimately the Tribunal considers the information is part of the reason for affirming the decision under review at the time its decision is made. The High Court considered the temporal issue in relation to s.359A in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [17] [15] . Further, in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 319 at [27] his Honour Heerey J considered that the assessment of whether or not information attracted a disclosure obligation at the time it came to the Tribunal's attention would not depend upon the use the Tribunal subsequently made of the information in its reasons. In the light of his Honour's decision, (which is binding upon me) I do not think it is open to me to treat the failure by the Tribunal to provide sufficient particulars of the information in its second s.359A letter as an error of law within jurisdiction on the basis that the Tribunal ultimately gave the information no weight. The failure by the Tribunal to provide sufficient particulars of information was a jurisdictional error [16] notwithstanding that the Tribunal ultimately gave the information no weight. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2009] FCA 99">In coming to this conclusion, his Honour distinguished the decision of Heerey J in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483. In that case, Heerey J observed that the decision of the High Court in SZBYR &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 impliedly overruled a substantial body of authority in the Federal Court in which it was held that an assessment of whether the Tribunal has complied with section 424A(1) requires close attention to the reasons of the Tribunal. Driver FM considered that MZXBQ was distinguishable from the present case because in MZXBQ , the relevant information was raised by the Tribunal at the section 425 hearing. </sentence>

For example, let it be assumed an applicant claimed fear of persecution in a country because he was a Christian, and the Tribunal has a written statement from X that the applicant said to him he never was a Christian and had invented the claim in order to get a visa. If true, X's statement, being "evidentiary material or documentation", would be a reason for the Tribunal's affirming the refusal of a visa.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs32" from="[2008] FMCA 1715">Taken together with the Consulate General's advice about the results of the internet and telephone checks carried out in relation to the claimed employer in the business visa application, the material consisting of the photograph in the visa application was information in the sense of evidentiary material (and not simply inconsistent claims) that " undermined " the applicant's claims in the sense considered in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 in so far as his identity " would be " relevant not only to his credibility, but also to whether the Tribunal would be satisfied as to what his situation was in China and hence whether to accept his claims about the past and that he had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. (Also see MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483). In this sense the information had dispositive relevance to the content of the Convention claims advanced by the applicant, consistent with the fact that the Tribunal questioned the applicant about it in the hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs33" from="[2008] FCA 1890">35 The decision in SZBYR was recently considered by Heerey J in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 ( MZXBQ ). At 492, at [27], Heerey J observed:
 SZBYR [2007] HCA 26 ; 81 ALJR 1190 ; 235 ALR 609 , and in particular [17] of the majority judgment, essentially says that the Tribunal must assess the "information" in question in terms of its dispositive relevance to the Convention claims advanced by the applicant before the Tribunal. For example, let it be assumed an applicant claimed fear of persecution in a country because he was a Christian, and the Tribunal has a written statement from X that the applicant said to him he never was a Christian and had invented the claim in order to get a visa. If true, X's statement, being "evidentiary material or documentation", would be a reason for the Tribunal's affirming the refusal of a visa. It would "undermine" his claims to have well-founded fear of persecution by reason of religion. By contrast, a statement by Y that the applicant had worked in Australia under a false name would at best only go to the applicant's credibility. If the Tribunal in either of these hypothetical instances had not given a s 424A notice the reviewing court would have to characterise the statements of X and Y and determine whether or not they attracted the s 424A obligation as at the time they came to the Tribunal's attention. This assessment would not depend on the use the Tribunal subsequently made of the statements in its reasons. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs34" from="[2008] FCA 1731">Similarly the wife's evidence as to the date when the business was attacked would be relevant because of its inconsistency with the applicant's evidence. 65. On the approach taken by Heerey J in MZXBQ [MZXBQ V Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 166 FCR 483 ; [2008] FCA 319] any appraisal of such inconsistency in evidence would go to the applicant's credibility, rather than being of itself such as to undermine the applicant's claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution as claimed. In those circumstances it cannot be said that the questioning of the applicant wife and her answers would be of dispositive relevance to the Convention claims advanced by the applicant before the Tribunal. As the first respondent submitted, consistent with the approach taken in SZBYR at [17] --- [18] and MZXBQ at [27], the appraisal of inconsistency and the credibility finding that resulted do not constitute information for the purposes of s.424A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs35" from="[2008] FMCA 1549">Counsel also properly took me to the decision of MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 319 at [6] , [7], [21] and in particular [27] which leant some support to the applicant's contention that the Tribunal did breach s.424A. It is noteworthy that Heerey J in MZXBQ referred to paragraph 33 of SZKLG in his judgment at [19]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs36" from="[2008] FMCA 1136">However in determining whether there is " information " within s.424A or a mere gap or deficiency in evidence " each case must depend on its own particular circumstances " as Weinberg J stated in NBKS (at [39]). Given that the application of s.424A(1) is to be determined " in advance --- and independently --- of the Tribunal's particular reasoning on the facts of the case " ( SZBYR at [17]) it is necessary to determine whether the omission in issue " would be " implicit probative support for a positive assertion detrimental to the applicant's case or whether it can be characterised as a mere gap or deficiency in evidence ( SZJJD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 3 at [73] ). As Heerey J stated in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 (at [27]) it is necessary to " assess the "information" in question in terms of its dispositive relevance to the Convention claims advanced by the applicant before the Tribunal. " Moreover, " information merely going to credibility is not within the section. An applicant may be disbelieved on some issues, but believed on others, or the application may be determined one way or the other by issues unrelated to credibility. Lack of credibility in itself does not necessarily involve rejection, denial or undermining of an applicant's claims" (at [29] and see also SZBYR at [21]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs37" from="[2008] FMCA 1046">Even if questions may be characterised as " information " this does not suffice to bring s.424A(1) into play if such information is not of the nature specified in that sub-section. The fact that the Tribunal recorded the questions put to the applicant in the process of describing her evidence does not mean that those questions necessarily became information that was, or more accurately " would be ", part of its reason for affirming the decision under review. In that respect I note that the operation of s 424A(1)(a) is to be determined "in advance - and independently - of the Tribunal's particular reasoning on the facts of the case" (see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 at [17] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ and see MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 and cases cited therein). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs38" from="[2008] FMCA 652">There is, however, recent authority in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 to the effect that the operation of s.424A(1) is to be determined " in advance --- and independently --- of the Tribunal's particular reasoning of the facts of the case " as Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ (at [17]) indicated by the use of the future conditional tense (" would be ") in s.424A(1) in (and see MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 and cases cited therein). As Heerey J stated MZXBQ, SZBYR " essentially says that a court must assess the " information" in question in terms of its dispositive relevance to the Convention claims advanced by the applicant before the Tribunal " (at [27]). His Honour distinguished (at [29]) between matters of such relevance and information " merely going to credibility " on the basis that a lack of credibility in itself " does not necessarily involve rejection, denial or undermining of an applicant's claims " (and see SZBYR at [17]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs39" from="[2008] FMCA 848">After referring to this line of authority Heerey J in MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 indicated that in the case before him the question of how far it was necessary to have regard to the Tribunal's actual reasons for decision did arise. In that case a Federal Magistrate had relied on an examination of the Tribunal's reasons in concluding that an issue the Tribunal had not mentioned was not considered by it to be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. The decision of Heerey J on appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court is binding on this Court (see SZGME v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 91 at [42] per Black CJ and Allsop J)  Each of the parties was given (and took) the opportunity to file post-hearing submissions addressing in more detail issues that arose in the hearing in relation to whether or not the Tribunal had an obligation to put any aspect of the evidence of the applicant wife at the Tribunal hearing to the applicant husband. The first respondent reiterated the contention that the Tribunal findings about where the applicant had he lived in India (and about his credibility) were not based on any inconsistency between his evidence and that of his wife. Counsel for the first respondent acknowledged that the obligations in s.424A(1) have been said to be enlivened at the point when the Tribunal considers that certain information would form part of the reasons for decision ( MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319). At the hearing the Tribunal questioned the applicant wife about her husband's place of residence in India and clearly observed an inconsistency with her husband's evidence in that regard. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs40" from="[2008] FMCA 824">Insofar as the applicant intends to take issue with the Tribunal's appraisal of inconsistencies between the various claims made to the delegate and to each Tribunal, such appraisals regarding the applicant's credibility are not " information " for the purposes of s.424A(1) of the Act. (See SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 at [18] and MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 at [29] ). </sentence>
