<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] APO 13">In Les Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Pty Ltd [2008] APO 11 the delegate noted that a change had been made to section 31A since General Steel (supra) and Stack (supra) which meant that:
 
"the principles set out in General Steel (supra) are not given "canonical force" in summary dismissal proceedings ( Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 425 at 427). Rather, a proceeding may be dismissed where a party has "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding" (see for example Garrett v Macks [2006] FCA 601 , White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 , Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 , Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 , Vans, Inc. v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 , E . &amp; J. Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 136 , and Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227). "
 
 
As noted in the Servier decision, a similar approach is also applied in England and Queensland. It seems clear that Parliament has decided that the approach to summary judgment in all federal courts should be the same, and that the same approach applies to all matters (not just to migration cases). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] SASC 19">Whilst I will not endeavour to comment on each proceeding instituted by Mr Garrett in the Federal Court, I will make the following observations. In the course of the 21 actions, at least 20 proceedings instituted by Mr Garrett in the actions were dismissed, struck-out or refused.

 Introduction 
 There are three applications before me. The first is a Notice for Specific Directions filed on 3 May 2007 by Andrew Morton Garrett in Action Number SCCIV-96-2244 ("Action 2244 of 1996").</sentence>

 14. Pursuant to this change, the principles set out in General Steel (supra) are not given "canonical force" in summary dismissal proceedings ( Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 425 at 427). Rather, a proceeding may be dismissed where a party has "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding" (see for example Garrett v Macks [2006] FCA 601 , White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 , Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 , Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 195 , Vans, Inc. v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 , E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 136 , and Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 489">9 The extent to which s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act relaxes the test formulated in General Steel has been the subject of observations in recent decisions of this Court: Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; Garrett v Macks [2006] FCA 601 per Lander J at [21]-[22]; Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 per Mansfield J at [26]-[29]; Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 per Tamberlin J at [12].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 1227">Merck submitted that the section provided a lesser test that the test which applies under the other provisions. It referred to observations of Heerey J in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 , in which his Honour said at [6]: 
 
 s 31A was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeouts (either of claims or defences) than that previously laid down by the High Court&#180;s decisions in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1948) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130, namely that the allegations are 'so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed'.
