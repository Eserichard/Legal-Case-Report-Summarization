<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 506">As Kenny J said in Nutrientwater at [31], the extent of the compromise involved is a relevant consideration in determining whether the rejection of the compromise offer was unreasonable. The modest extent of the compromise offered was a factor which lead to the rejection of the application for indemnity costs in Nutrientwater ; Inform Design and Construction Pty Ltd v Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 965 at [29]; and in Truenergy at [14]. To give weight to the extent of the compromise offered is in keeping with the underlying policy of encouraging settlement. Borderline offers of compromise ought not be given the same potency as generous offers which are far more likely to encourage settlement. </sentence>
