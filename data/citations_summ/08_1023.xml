However, this matter was considered by Lindgren J in Lee v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1023. At [26] of that decision his Honour said : " Section 198(6) of the Act is mandatory in its terms. It has the effect that an "officer" (defined in s.5 of the Act) must remove the applicant from Australia "as soon as reasonably practical". The fact that the applicant desires to prosecute his appeal on 22 July 2008 does not render it not "reasonably practical" for an officer to remove him from Australia prior to that date. This court does not have a general jurisdiction to relieve from the effect of s.198(6).
