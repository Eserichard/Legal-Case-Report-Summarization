<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 397">The second authority to which I was taken was Nguyen v Pascoe (2006) FCA 719 , a decision of a single judge of the Federal Court of Australia sitting as the Full Court on appeal from a federal magistrate. In that case the two passages to which I have just referred were cited. But beyond referring to those two passages in a general sense, there was no particular discussion about the nature or extent of the power vested in the courts exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction by s.30(1) of the Bankruptcy Act and in particular, whether the power extended to making orders for sale in cases like that presently before me. The appeal in that case turned on entirely different issues. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 851">Notwithstanding the difference in language as between O 52 r 5(3) and O 52 r 15(2), namely the constraint in r 15(2) that the Court may give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal " at any time " where there are " special reasons ", principles relevant to the exercise of that discretion have been applied when considering r 5(3): SZMFT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1725. Cowdroy J there stated: 
 [21] The Court observes that in considering whether to grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal under O 52 r 15(2) of the Rules, the Court must be satisfied that there is an acceptable explanation for the delay, that there would be no undue prejudice to the respondent if the Court were to grant leave, and that there is merit in the substantial application: see Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348---349. There appears to be no valid reason why such considerations should not also apply to an application seeking an order of the Court that dispenses with the 21 day time limit prescribed by O 52 r 5(2) of the Rules. 

 
Compliance with O 52 r 5(2) was there dispensed with in circumstances where the application for leave to appeal was filed out of time by ten days. See also: Nguyen v Pascoe [2006] FCA 719 at [41] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 61">As a preliminary point I note that the issue before the Court is not whether the orders of 12 March 2007 dismissing the judicial review applications should be set aside under r.16.05 as having been made in the absence of the applicants. The question of whether or not the applicants had an adequate explanation for their non-appearance on 12 March 2007, which would be relevant to such an application, would not require proof of default, negligence, improper conduct or other misconduct on the part of the lawyer such as required under r.21.07. Rather what would be in issue would be whether the applicants could show that by accident and without fault on their part the orders were made without them being heard ( Theo v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Black CJ, Sackville and Finn JJ, QG 160 of 1996, QG 16 of 1998, 23 July 1998)). Any such application under r.16.05 would have to be considered in light of the whole of the relevant circumstances ( Glenhill Enterprises Pty Ltd v BHP Australia Ltd, (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Whitlam J, VG 112 of 1991, 1 June 1993)) including whether there was an arguable case or a realistic or reasonable prospect of successfully establishing the existence of jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal (see KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung, (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Tamberlin J, NG3187 of 1994, 2 June 1995); NAFG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 389 ; Shocked v Goldschmidt [1998] 1 ALL ER 372 at 381 per Legatt CJ; Nguyen v Pascoe [2006] FCA 719 ; and SZFLH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1287 at [18] per Conti J). </sentence>
