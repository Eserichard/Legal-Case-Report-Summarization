<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 236">72 The medical opinion accepted by the Tribunal, given some two years after the claimed injury, was that the additional conditions were aggravated by Mr Sellick's work duties. The Tribunal does not explain how the claimed pain and injury of 2002 which had resolved resulted in the additional conditions which, in turn, were the reason for Mr Sellick's ongoing pain. The 2004 diagnoses were made well after the injury he sustained in 2002. Mr Sellick has not demonstrated how they fulfil the claim requirements of the SRC Act. It is impossible to understand from the Tribunal's reasons the reasoning process that led it to conclude that Australia Post continued to be liable for a claimed injury that had resolved and where the claimed symptoms of that injury had resolved. The Tribunal accepted that the additional conditions were caused by or rendered symptomatic by Mr Sellick's work duties but did not explain the connection with the specific claim. Failure to consider issues critical to the validity of its decision is a failure to address the correct legal question which is an error of law ( Australian Postal Corporation v Barry [2006] FCA 1751 ; [2006] 44 AAR 186 at [23] ---[24]). There is an error of law where the Tribunal's reasoning is impossible to understand ( Lang at [55]).</sentence>
