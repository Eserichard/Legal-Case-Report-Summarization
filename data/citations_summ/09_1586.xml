<citphrase id="cp55.19" type=cited from="[1979] FCA 85">trade practices act 1974 (cth), s. 45d (1). the appellant, tillmanns butcheries pty. ltd. ("tillmanns"), was a wholesale and retail butcher carrying on business in canberra and queanbeyan. the first-named respondent, the australasian meat industry employees' union ("the union") was an organization of employees including employees of wholesale and retail butchers and employees in abattoirs. the third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents were the president, secretary and two organizers of the union respectively. in december 1977 two of the respondents entered tillmannss' shop in queanbeyan and asked to see the employees. the request was refused by tillmanns' managing director because it was neither smoko nor lunchtime. the union retaliated by imposing a black ban upon tillmanns' shops. at that time canberra abattoir pty. ltd. ("canberra abattoir"), a company which conducted an abattoir in the australian capital territory, held for tillmanns thirty-two cattle awaiting slaughter and the carcasses of twenty head of cattle and seventeen pigs. as a result of the black ban by the union the live cattle were not slaughtered for some weeks and the carcasses were released to tillmanns only about a week later to avoid deterioration. the appellant instituted an action in the federal court of australia seeking an injunction and damages under ss. 80 and 82 in relation to s. 45d of the trade practices act 1974 ("the act ") alleging that the respondents acted in concert to prevent supplies of meat to tillmanns in breach of s. 45d of the act . the trial judge declined to find that the respondents' conduct had the relevant effect and refused to award damages or to grant an injunction. he stated in his judgment, inter alia, that the plaintiff (appellant) was not entitled to argue that the conduct complained of would be likely to cause substantial loss where the means of proving whether in fact it did cause substantial loss were in its power. the appellant appealed to the full court of the federal court of australia against this judgment claiming that an injunction should have been ordered.  held: per curiam</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp55.20" type=cited from="[1979] FCA 85">the appeal against the first, third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents should be upheld, the cross appeal of those respondents should be dismissed and the appellant should be granted injunctive relief against the above-named respondents because: (1) the appellant was entitled to seek relief on the ground that the relevant conduct of the respondents, if continued, would or would be likely to have the effect of causing substantial loss or damage to the appellant's business.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 454">The Crown also submitted that the assessment of the value of the "information" is required to be prospective. In that respect, it relied upon the dicta of the Federal Court (Gilmour J) in ASIC v Fortescue Metals Group Limited (No 5) [2009] FCA 1586 ; (2009) 264 ALR 201 at 301, [474] . The chance of a real gain, the Crown contended, must have been in contemplation by the offender at the time that he placed the order of "$50,000 worth of shares in circumstances where he was required by law not to engage in such a transaction" .

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] HCA 11">The rule in Jones v Dunkel [47] is that the unexplained failure by a party to call a witness may in appropriate circumstances support an inference that the uncalled evidence would not have assisted the party's case. That is particularly so where it is the party which is the uncalled witness [48] . The failure to call a witness may also permit the court to draw, with greater confidence, any inference unfavourable to the party that failed to call the witness, if that uncalled witness appears to be in a position to cast light on whether the inference should be drawn [49] . These principles have been extended from instances where a witness has not been called at all to instances where a witness has been called but not questioned on particular topics. Where counsel for a party has refrained from asking a witness whom that party has called particular questions on an issue, the court will be less likely to draw inferences favourable to that party from other evidence in relation to that issue [50] . That problem did not arise here. The plaintiff's counsel did ask the plaintiff relevant questions.
