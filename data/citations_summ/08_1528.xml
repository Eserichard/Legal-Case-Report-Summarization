<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 564">The Tribunal's Chairperson initially declined to make a submission. When I prompted her to do so, she referred to the Psychologists Registration Board case and also to Smith v Superannuation Complaints Tribunal [2008] FCA 1528. In the latter case, the Tribunal was found to have denied procedural fairness to a complainant in deciding, by means of a reasoned decision, that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to deal with that complainant's complaint. Neither the Tribunal nor the trustee involved appears to have made any submission to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] SCTA 4">The Complainant appealed from that determination to the Federal Court pursuant to s 46 of the Complaints Act. The Federal Court set aside the Tribunal's determination and ordered that the complaint be referred to the Tribunal to be determined according to law [i] .
