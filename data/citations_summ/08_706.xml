<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 168">1 These proceedings concern an appeal, and cross-appeal, from a judge of this Court who allowed an appeal by the first respondent, Mr Woodward, from a decision of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (the Tribunal): Woodward v Australian Super Pty Ltd (formerly STA) [2008] FCA 706.  9 On 19 April 2002, Mr Woodward was involved in an accident while riding his motor cycle home from work. As a result of the accident, he claimed to have suffered injuries to his ankles, right knee and lower back. He continued to work at Rexel with the aid of painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication until he resigned on 2 August 2002, citing "back pain, ankle pain, nightmares and 'an extreme amount of pressure from management'": Woodward [2008] FCA 706 at [9] .  13 This clause has been amended from time to time following the initial settlement of the superannuation fund: by a Deed of Variation dated 29 May 2001, effective 1 April 2001; by a Deed of Variation dated 27 June 2002, effective 27 June 2002; and by a Deed of Variation dated 19 December 2002, effective 26 February 2003 ( Woodward [2008] FCA 706 at [81] ). The learned primary judge (at [81]) did not regard the amendment, effective on 26 February 2003 as relevant. Nor do we. Evidently though, his Honour considered that the Tribunal ought to have looked to a yet later, 2005 version, of the trust deed. Quite how the definition of TPD in any such later version of the trust deed differed, if at all, from that in effect at 2 August 2002 is not apparent in the material concerning the wording of the trust deed from time to time which was before the learned primary judge. Be this as it may, it was the conception that the wrong version of the trust deed had been looked to which occasioned the quashing of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
