86 Consistent with this, in Shrimp v Landmark Operations Limited [2007] FCA 1468 ; (2007) 163 FCR 510 , Besanko J held that a "concurrent wrongdoer" referred to in s 87CB(3) of the Trade Practices Act only includes persons whose acts or omissions caused the damage or loss that is the subject of the claim if they are liable to the claimant for that loss or damage. His Honour stated at 523 [62]: "The definition of concurrent wrongdoer seems to be the critical subsection and, in my opinion, the word 'caused' in s 87CB(3) should be read as meaning such as to give rise to a liability in the concurrent wrongdoer to the plaintiff or applicant. "</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 360">4 The debate proceeded also on the basis that, for a person to be a concurrent wrongdoer under Part 4 of the Civil Liability Act , the person must be liable to the plaintiff: perhaps, an extended reading of the word "caused" in the definition of "concurrent wrongdoer" in s 34(2) of that Act. The reasons for that construction were given by Besanko J in Shrimp v Landmark Operations Ltd [2007] FCA 1468 ; (2007) 163 FCR 510 at 523 [62] . His Honour's analysis was adopted and applied by Nettle JA, with whom Mandie J and Beach AJA agreed, in St George Bank Limited v Quinerts Pty Ltd [2009] VSCA 245 at [58] , [64].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] VSCA 245">64 In my view, however, that is not the case. [41] As Besanko J held in Shrimp v Landmark Operations, [42] a 'concurrent wrongdoer' includes a person whose acts or omissions caused the damage or loss that is the subject of the plaintiff's claim only if the person is 'liable' to the plaintiff for that loss and damage. In light of s 24AI(3) , however, 'liable' in the sense identified by Besanko J must include both presently liable and liable in the sense of having been liable and, but for ceasing to exist, would still be liable. It would be inapposite to describe a person who was liable, but has ceased to be liable because they have ceased to exist, as being 'liable'. Hence, it appears to me that the drafter of s 24AH chose 'cause' rather than 'liable' to accommodate the possibility that apportionment may be ordered in relation to a concurrent wrongdoer who is not presently liable but who was liable and, but for ceasing to exist, would still be liable.  
 
 58 It is important to keep in mind, however, that the proportionate liability provisions were not designed to do any more than that. As Besanko J observed in Shrimp v Landmark Operations Ltd, [33] concerning the comparable provisions of Part VIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth): 
 
 
 The above references [to extrinsic materials] suggest that the mischief to which the amendments were directed was a plaintiff being able to recover 100% of his damages from any one of several wrongdoer's when that wrongdoer's 'fault', when compared with the other wrongdoers, was less or far less than that. In other words, the amendment was directed to what were considered to be the undesirable consequences of the joint and several liability rule. There is no suggestion that the mischief the amendments were designed to remedy was any wider than that. The definition of concurrent wrongdoer seems to be the critical subsection and, in my opinion, the word 'caused' in s 87CB(3) [34] should be read as meaning such as to give rise to a liability in the concurrent wrongdoer to the plaintiff or applicant . [35]  That one respondent can be held liable for all the claimant's loss regardless of how much he or she contributed to that loss. This common law principle protects claimants by allowing them to recover the total damage suffered from at least one of the respondents. [37] </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] QDC 269">There have been two recent decisions where courts have confined the scope of the definition of "concurrent wrongdoer" in corresponding legislation, where the definition is in essentially the same terms, in this way: Shrimp v Landmark Operations Ltd [2007] FCA 1468 and Atkins v Interprac Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 445. Shrimp v Landmark Operations Ltd [2007] FCA 1468 --- followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] VSCA 208">It was put this way in Shrimp &amp; Anor v Landmark Operations Ltd &amp; Ors: [19] 
 
... the mischief to which the amendments were directed was a plaintiff being able to recover 100% of his damages from any one of several wrongdoers when that wrongdoer's 'fault', when compared with the other wrongdoers, was less or far less than that.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] VCC 764"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] SADC 42">The plaintiff has not established that the delay attached to the resolution of the issue of discovery between CGU and WMC is a circumstance sufficient to require a direction, in the interests of justice, that there be a separate trial on the issue of the liability of WMC and quantum of damages. Any benefit to the plaintiff in having a separate trial is outweighed in my opinion by the desirability of having all parties bound by the decision between the plaintiff and the defendant so as to avoid the possibility of inconsistent findings, the burden of the additional cost and expense of two trials, the disadvantages to WMC in two trials, including reliance on the plaintiff having to be available to give evidence for a second time in the trial between WMC and CGU, and WMC's possibly having to satisfy a judgment in favour of the plaintiff well before its claim against the third party is determined.

 This is an appeal against a decision of a Master. The appeal is brought pursuant to section 43 of the District Court Act 1991 , which relevantly provides: 
 
A party to an action may, in accordance with the rules of the appellate court, appeal against any judgment given in the action.</sentence>
