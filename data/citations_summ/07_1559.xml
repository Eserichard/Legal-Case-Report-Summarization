<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1005">The background to the claim for the first six categories is to be found in two judgments of Tamberlin J, Jarra Creek Central Packaging Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2007] FCA 1559 ; Jarra Creek Central Packaging Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2009] FCA 60. Tamberlin J was the docket judge for the matter before he reached the age of Constitutional retirement on 31 March 2009. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 60">In substance, the dispute between the parties concerns the appropriate particularity and detail at which discovery should be made. I have made previous orders for discovery in this matter on 19 November 2007: see Jarra Creek Central Packing Shed v Amcor Limited (2007) FCA 1559 , which sets out the general background. The Visy respondents contend that nothing material has changed since those orders and that there is no need for further orders of discovery because the present application seeks documents that were sought but not ordered to be produced on the previous application. The Visy respondents also say that, although after the making of the previous orders the applicant amended its pleading, in respect of the essential allegation for discovery purposes, there has been no significant change. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 554">2 Aspects of the background to this matter have been briefly discussed in my previous judgments: see Jarra Creek Central Packing Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2006] FCA 1802 ; Jarra Creek Central Packing Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2007] FCA 1559 ; and Jarra Creek Central Packing Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 391. I set out below in short compass some additional background information relevant to this application.</sentence>
