The Applicant must prove allegations according to the civil standard of proof established under s.140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). This provision codifies the common law position in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at p.361-2 that the strength of evidence necessary to establish a fact on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what is sought to be proved, and in particular, by reference to the gravity of the matters in question: Employment Advocate v Williamson (2008) 1111 FCR 20 at [65]; Qantas Airways Limited v Gamma [2008] FCAFC 69 ; (2001) 167 FCR 537 per Branson J at [128]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 480">Both the applicant and the respondents agree the principles for determining such an application are now relevantly well-settled.

[2] Quoting those seven principles she then stated: "The set of principles were summarised, in my view accurately, by Phipps FM in Drew &amp; Bates as three matters. (1) Explanation for delay. (2) Any prejudice to the respondent (3) Whether the applicant had an arguable case. " </sentence>
