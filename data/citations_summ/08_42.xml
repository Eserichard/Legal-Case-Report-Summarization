<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 450">As was observed by the Full Court in CGU Insurance Ltd at [75], the following principles should apply where an offer is made not in accordance with the Rules but which is purportedly a Calderbank offer: 
 
 From the tenor of claims which have come before the court in recent years, there appears to be a view abroad that the failure of a party who has rejected a Calderbank offer ultimately to achieve a better outcome than provided for in the offer leads to a presumptive entitlement to indemnity costs with respect to the period subsequent to the offer. Such a view would be mistaken. Where a moving party (including a cross-claimant) offers to settle for a sum which is less than he or she eventually achieves at trial, there is a presumptive entitlement to indemnity costs under O 23 r 11(4) of the Federal Court Rules . However, where recourse is not had to the O 23, but reliance is placed upon the court's general discretion, it is necessary for the party seeking indemnity costs to demonstrate that the other party's refusal of the Calderbank offer was unreasonable: Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 , 432; Maniotis v JH Lever &amp; Co Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCAFC 28.

In considering this question in a particular case, the matter of unreasonableness will be judged by reference to the circumstances facing the offeree at the time of the offer. While the eventual outcome in the case may go part of the way in this regard, there is no presumption that ultimate success in the proceeding for the offeror necessarily renders the offeree's rejection unreasonable.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 30">In support of an indemnity costs order, Mr Cvitanovic makes the following points: Mr Cvitanovic's demands for the money were made prior to the commencement of the litigation, and Mr Kukulovski's responses made no claim to hold a security interest in the funds until after the proceedings were commenced. The deeds of guarantee upon which this assertion was based were not produced until after the proceedings were commenced. Mr Cvitanovic's demands were resisted upon denials by Mr Kukulovski of knowledge of Mr Rosee's insolvency at the relevant times, which were not maintained at the hearing. Mr Cvitanovic offered to settle the matter for $30,000 inclusive of costs at a mediation on 10 September 2010, and in a "without prejudice offer to settle the proceedings" made and rejected on 22 October 2010. The Court should take the view "that it was unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the expenditure of costs" (citing Jessup J in Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 42 and Gray J in Hamod v State of New South Wales (2002) 188 ALR 659 and 665). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 500">Ms Attwood's case is essentially that reasonable offers were rejected by the respondent and therefore she ought to be awarded costs. Ms Attwood submits that: the rejection of a reasonable offer is not to be automatically regarded as unreasonable, [33] the rejection of a favourable offer at a time when the party had ample time to assess a claim can be unreasonable in circumstances where it would be unfair to require another party to bear costs for which it was not reimbursed; [34] in Donnelly the Full Court of the Federal Court said that: ... The foundation for the order is the need for the costs order to do equity where a party who has succeeded in the proceeding has made a reasonable attempt to terminate the proceeding by an offer to compromise shown to have been a fair offer in all the circumstances and to have provided appropriate opportunity for the offeree to consider and deal with the offer.

Such a view would be mistaken. Where a moving party (including a cross-claimant) offers to settle for a sum which is less than he or she eventually achieves at trial, there is a presumptive entitlement to indemnity costs under O 23 r 11(4) of the Federal Court Rules . However, where recourse is not had to the O 23, but reliance is placed upon the court's general discretion, it is necessary for the party seeking indemnity costs to demonstrate that the other party's refusal of the Calderbank offer was unreasonable: Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 , 432; Maniotis v JH Lever &amp; Co Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCAFC 28. It is not sufficient that the offer was a reasonable one: Alpine Hardwoods (Aust) Pty Ltd v Hardys Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 224 ; (2002) 190 ALR 121 , 128 [35]; Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 42 , [11]. In considering this question in a particular case, the matter of unreasonableness will be judged by reference to the circumstances facing the offeree at the time of the offer. While the eventual outcome in the case may go part of the way in this regard, there is no presumption that ultimate success in the proceeding for the offeror necessarily renders the offeree's rejection unreasonable. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FMCA 1358">The applicants also rely upon the comments of French J (as he then was) in University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) BC200806572 where he concluded at [32] in summarising the applicable principles that: 1. Mere refusal of a "Calderbank offer" does not itself warrant an order for indemnity costs. In this connection it may be noted that Jessup J in Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 42 said that (at [6]) - If the rejection of such an offer is to ground a claim for indemnity costs, it must be by reason of some circumstance other than that the offer happened to comply with the Calderbank principle. 2. To obtain an order for indemnity costs the offeror must show that the refusal to accept it was unreasonable. 3. The reasonableness of the conduct of the offeree is to be viewed in the light of the circumstances that existed when the offer was rejected. Was the rejection of the Calderbank offer unreasonable? </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FCA 1056">32 The general principles governing the exercise of the discretion to award indemnity costs after rejection by an unsuccessful party of a so called Calderbank letter were set out in the judgment of the Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386. In summary those principles are: 
 
1. Mere refusal of a "Calderbank offer" does not itself warrant an order for indemnity costs. In this connection it may be noted that Jessup J in Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 42 said that (at [6]): 
 
 
 if the rejection of such an offer is to ground a claim for indemnity costs, it must be by reason of some circumstance other than that the offer happened to comply with the Calderbank principle. 
 

2. To obtain an order for indemnity costs the offeror must show that the refusal to accept it was unreasonable. 3. The reasonableness of the conduct of the offeree is to be viewed in the light of the circumstances that existed when the offer was rejected. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] NSWLEC 107">5 The RTA submits that it must be shown that its conduct in rejecting the Calderbank offer was unreasonable if there is to be a departure from the ordinary rule that costs are to be paid on a party and party basis: Dais Studio Pty Limited v Bullet Creative Pty Limited [2008] FCA 42. There Jessup J referred at [9] to Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 where the Full Court of the Federal Court referred to a line of authority in the court which supported the proposition that the mere refusal of a Calderbank offer does not, of itself, warrant an order for indemnity costs and that the offeror needs to show that the conduct of the offeree was unreasonable.</sentence>
