<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 16">18 In a judgment delivered on 24 December 2008 ( Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Limited v Rickus (No 3) [2008] FCA 1986) , Flick J ordered that the appellant's Cross-Claim be dismissed with costs and that each party was to bear its own costs of and incidental to the Trustee's proceedings. This last order related only to the period from 27 November 2007 up to 28 July 2008. It was not intended to and did not affect the order for indemnity costs made in favour of the appellant on 26 November 2007. However, the costs incurred by the appellant in the period from November 2007 up to 28 July 2008 are said to be substantial.</sentence>
