<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 413">Thirdly, the CEO raised the question whether this appeal in fact raised any appeal on a question of law. There are many cases where the scope of s 44(1) of the AAT Act has been considered, including recently Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524; Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321 at 324-325; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd (2003) 133 FCR 290 at 300-302; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 526-527; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at 104-106; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 248 ALR 456 at 465-468. Section 44(1) of the AAT Act is not enlivened by inquisitorial questions, such as "Did the Tribunal err in law ..." or by assertions as to an error of law expressed in only several terms. Of course, allowance must be paid for the difficulty confronting litigants in person in endeavouring to clearly identify and express an asserted error on a question of law, but merely asserting such an error because a putative appellant disagrees with the outcome or by saying the outcome involves such an error is not enough. Those comments may apply directly to the present notice of appeal. However, the appeal has been dismissed simply because there was no reviewable decision before the Tribunal even if an extension of time were granted, and because in any event the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion to refuse an extension of time did not miscarry and was not a consequence of any error of law on its part. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 10"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1485">Section 161 of the Act, like s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act"), allows an appeal to this Court only on a question of law. The existence of a question of law is not merely a qualifying condition to ground an appeal under s 44, but is also the subject matter of the appeal itself: see TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178 per Gummow J. The Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for pure questions of law to be identified and for them to appear in the notice of appeal in order for the Court to be able to entertain an appeal: see, for example, Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524; Birdseye at 324-325; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at 300-302; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 526-527; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at 104-106; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 169 FCR 241 at 253-7. In Birdseye , Branson and Stone JJ held (at 325) that: 
"... O 53 r 3(2) discloses an intention that a question of law to be raised on an appeal from the tribunal should be stated with precision as a pure question of law . It is in the specification of the grounds relied upon in support of the orders sought that, in our view, one should expect to find the links between the question of law, the circumstances of the particular case and the orders sought on the appeal" (emphasis added). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1272">That is directed to the Tribunal's fact finding. Question (e) asks whether the Tribunal failed to take into account unidentified "relevant matters". In Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at [19] a question whether the Tribunal failed to take into account one or more relevant considerations was held not to state a question of law on the grounds that it was insufficiently particular, begs the question as indicated in Lambroglou 12 AAR 515 , and refers to a conclusion the court may or may not reach, which needs to be based on a specifically stated question of law. Question (f) asks whether it was "open to" the Tribunal to make a finding. Question (g) asks whether the Tribunal "correctly applied" the definition of disease or injury in s 5D of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1610">19 It is, therefore, essential, in appeals brought under s 44 of the AAT Act , that a question or questions of law be identified. If the notice of appeal fails to disclose a question of law the necessary subject matter of the appeal is lacking. The Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for pure questions of law to be identified and for them to appear in the notice of appeal in order for the Court to be able to entertain an appeal: see, for example, Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524; Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321 at 324-325; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at 300-302; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 526-527; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at 104-106; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 248 ALR 456 at 465-468. In Birdseye Branson and Stone JJ held (at 325) that:
 "... O 53 r 3(2) discloses an intention that a question of law to be raised on an appeal from the tribunal should be stated with precision as a pure question of law. It is in the specification of the grounds relied upon in support of the orders sought that, in our view, one should expect to find the links between the question of law, the circumstances of the particular case and the orders sought on the appeal. " (Emphasis added. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1535">12 It is, therefore, essential, in appeals brought under s 44 of the AAT Act , that a question or questions of law be identified.

" (Emphasis added). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 441">6 Accordingly, the relevant question of law is to be the subject matter of the appeal itself. The whole of the decision of the Tribunal is not open to review except to the extent that it is relevant to the questions of law raised (Gummow J in TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 19 ATR 1067 at 1071-1072; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at [46] ; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101). </sentence>
