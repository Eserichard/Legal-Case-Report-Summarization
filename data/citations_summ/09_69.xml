<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 274">The respondents submit that: even assuming ground 1.1 pleads a jurisdictional error, the pleaded error is not made out; that the Tribunal did in fact and in law conduct a fresh hearing untrammelled by the findings made, and the outcome reached, in the Purported Decision; that cases such as Sperway Constructions deal with: the meaning of "appeal" in the context of various statutory appeal rights; possible meanings include "appeal by way of re-hearing", "hearing de novo ", "appeal in the strict sense", etc; and ultimately, the meaning of the word "appeal" turns upon a proper construction of the statute containing the right of appeal; [14] the real question is whether the Tribunal complied with the writ of mandamus which did no more than require the Tribunal to act in accordance with the Migration Act --- including s.425 ; [15] that ground 1.1 is based on a mis-reading of the Tribunal Decision, in that: the Tribunal did not adopt any finding or conclusion made in the Purported Decision; and all that the Tribunal did was summarise the case presented by the applicant which resulted in the Purported Decision; there is, in principle, no difference between following a course, such as that adopted by the Tribunal here, and noting a previous inconsistent statement made by the applicant before the Delegate or in the documents lodged with the Tribunal in support of the application for review, and, therefore, there can be no objection to the Tribunal taking into account the previous evidence presented by the applicant leading to the making of the Purported Decision; there is no objection to a trial judge adopting word for word an extract from a party's outline of submissions, so long as the judge brings to bear an independent mind, and is seen to do so, [16] and, by analogy, there can be no objection to the Tribunal adopting a conclusion made by a previous Tribunal; and there is nothing in the Tribunal's Decision to suggest that the Tribunal considered itself bound by a finding or conclusion in the Purported Decision. Background
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 530">Essentially, the applicant asserts procedural unfairness. In view of the generality of those claims, I required an initial hearing under rule 44.12 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth), which was conducted on 2 March 2009. At that hearing, I identified two arguable issues of jurisdictional error, upon which I required the Minister to show cause why relief should not be granted. Those are: whether the Tribunal breached s.425 of the Migration Act by failing to ensure that the applicant understood the essential and significant issues relating to the review at the most recent hearing conducted by the Tribunal, having regard to the decision of the Federal Court in NBKB v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 69 ; and whether the Tribunal erred in relation to its application of s.91R(3) of the Migration Act by limiting its consideration of the applicant's conduct in Australia to his joining a Falun Gong practice group rather than taking into account the full period of that conduct.  He also said that the Tribunal should not have rejected his review application. He was, perhaps understandably, unable to make any submissions relating to the legal issues identified in the show cause order. Those issues are dealt with in the Minister's submissions from paragraphs 20 through to 31, which I incorporate in this judgment: The first issue: NBKB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [10] The Minister submits that NBKB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 69 ; (2009) 106 ALD 525 has no application to the facts of this case. On the authority of NBKB , [11] the Court is required to assess whether the Tribunal member who is making the decision (which is the subject of the application for judicial review) sufficiently (and it seems personally) alerted the applicant to 'critical issues' arising under the review: see NBKB at [39]. [12] It is submitted that NBKB has no application here because the critical issues in the present case were sufficiently alerted to the applicant by the Tribunal member who made the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 486">That is why the point at which to begin the identification of issues arising in relation to the decision under review will usually be the reasons given for that decision. And unless some other additional issues are identified by the Tribunal (as they may be), it would ordinarily follow that, on review by the Tribunal, the issues arising in relation to the decision under review would be those which the original decision-maker identified as determinative against the applicant.
