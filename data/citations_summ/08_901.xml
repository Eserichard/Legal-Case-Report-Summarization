<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 80">130 Mr Van Tol Tran brought a proceeding in this Court against the Commonwealth. After a trial, the primary judge made the following order and declaration, relevantly:
 The Court orders that: 1. The application be dismissed. The Court declares that: 
 
 1. Title in the ship with the markings Hao Kiet BL91693TS passed to the Commonwealth on and from 1 July 2003 and all rights and title to that ship were vested in the Commonwealth on and from 1 July 1993. 
 

The primary judge's reasons are set out in Tran v The Commonwealth [2008] FCA 901 ("Tran No 1") and Tran v The Commonwealth [2009] FCA 474 ("Tran No 2").</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 921">Cowdroy J dismissed Mr Tran's claim for compensation at first instance ( Tran v The Commonwealth (2008) 103 ALD 290 ; [2008] FCA 901 ( Tran No 1 ); Tran v The Commonwealth (2009) 108 ALD 531 ; [2009] FCA 474 ( Tran No 2 )). The principal basis upon which his Honour did so in Tran No 2 turned on the construction of ss 261A and 42 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). Section 261A(1)(a) of the Migration Act provides for forfeiture to the Commonwealth of a vessel used or involved in a contravention of the Act (where the contravention occurred in Australia), if the contravention involved: (i) the bringing or coming to Australia of one or more persons who were, or upon entry into Australia became, unlawful non-citizens; or (ii) the entry or proposed entry into Australia of one or more such persons. Section 42(1) provides that a non-citizen must not travel to Australia without a visa that is in effect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 474">On 16 June 2008 the Court delivered its findings in respect of specific questions which were asked of it pursuant to O 29 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules (Cth): see Tran v The Commonwealth [2008] FCA 901 ; (2008) 103 ALD 290 (' Tran No. 1 '). Since the facts and legislation are set out in that decision, the present decision should be read in conjunction with Tran No. 1 . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1545">61 The conferral of a discretion by s 54(3) stands in contrast to other statutory regimes which more simply provide that identified categories of goods " shall be forfeited to the Crown ": eg, Customs Act 1901 (Cth), s 229(1) ; Excise Act 1901 (Cth), s 116(1). Section 229, it has been said, " gives rise to an immediate forfeiture of affected goods, without the need for any specific act on the part of Customs or the courts ": Pellegrino v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2008] NSWCCA 17 at [63] , [2008] NSWCCA 17 ; 243 ALR 556 at 571 per Basten JA (Hidden and Barr JJ agreeing). See also: Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), s 85. Some provisions, such as s 261A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), provide that goods " are forfeited to the Commonwealth ". That section is contained within Part 2 Division 13A to the 1958 Act, a Division headed " Automatic forfeiture of things used in certain offences ". Forfeiture effected by s 261A nevertheless remains " contestable ": Tran v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 901 , 103 ALD 290. Many other instances can also be provided of Commonwealth and State legislatures authorising forfeiture of goods: eg, Proceeds of Crimes Act 2002 (Cth); Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989 (NSW); Confiscation Act 1997 (Vic). See also: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Mylecharane [2007] NSWSC 1174 , 215 FLR 18 ; Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Nikolaou [2008] VSC 111 at [24] .</sentence>
