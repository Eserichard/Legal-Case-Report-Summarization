<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 175">4 As Black CJ pointed out in Forestry Tasmania v Brown (No 2) [2007] FCA 604 , the new rules demanded a departure from the previous practice. The previous practice is exemplified in such cases as Re Boulton v Ex Parte State of Victoria (1994) 126 ALR 620. It would be curious if, as a matter of power, the introduction of new rules by the Federal Court in 2002 had the effect of dramatically altering the scope and reach of s 824 of the Act as then applied. 33 In Forestry Tasmania v Brown (No 2) [2007] FCA 604 Black CJ addressed the status of an appeal where parties had intervened pursuant to Order 6 rule 17 at the trial level. In the course of the Chief Justice's reasons for judgment he made general observations in relation to the operation of the new rules. He observed that the Rules demanded a departure from the previous practice. He observed that the rules drew an express distinction between interveners and parties. He emphasised that the new rules provided that the role of an intervener was 'solely to assist the Court in its task of resolving the issues raised by the parties' (at [9]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1162">There are exceptional circumstances where courts allow persons who are not necessary parties to participate in proceedings as an intervenor or amicus curiae (cf Sharman Networks Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 178 ; (2006) 155 FCR 291 at [5] and [11]). There may be doubts how far an inferior court has inherent power to permit this, absent any statutory provision. In the present situation, there is no specific right of a migration agent to intervene in a s.476 application conferred by any statute, and the Federal Court rules adopted by our rules would not seem to be applicable (cf. Forestry Tasmania v Brown (No 2) [2007] FCA 604 ; (2007) 159 FCR 467 at [10] ). In any event, Mr Solaiman's counsel did not seek to support his application by reference to any statutory or implied power to permit the involvement of an intervenor or amicus curiae . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] HCATrans 258">A subsequent decision of Chief Justice Black in Forestry Tasmania v Brown No 2 [2007] FCA 604 ; (2005) 159 FCR 467 in which his Honour held that "party" when used in Order 52, rule 14 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 was not to be understood as extending to interveners, was said to depend upon the particular terms of the rules then in issue.</sentence>
