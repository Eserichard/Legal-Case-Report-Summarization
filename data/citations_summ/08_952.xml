<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 616">The respondents emphasised statements to the effect that the court's power to order that the costs of an interlocutory proceeding be paid forthwith is exercised only in very special circumstances ( Vasyli v AOL International Pty Ltd (unreported, Lehane J, 2 September 1996)). The applicants referred to statements in the authorities to the effect that the power to order that the costs of an interlocutory proceeding be paid forthwith should be used less sparingly than it has in the past: ( Airservices Australia v Jeppesen Sanderson Inc [2006] FCA 906 at [31] per Graham J). 
 

 
 
 23 In addition to the authorities which I have mentioned, I refer to Spotwire Pty Ltd v Visa International Service Association (No 2) [2004] FCA 571 at [103] - [109] per Bennett J; IO Group Inc v Prestige Club Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1147 at [20] - [25] per Flick J; McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 at [13]- [20], [24], [41] per Weinberg J; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 952 at [24] per Gordon J; and Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [35] . 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] TASSC 103">I do not accept though, that the permitted amendment effectively brings "a new proceeding", as influenced Lehane J in Vasyli v AOL International Pty Ltd (above). 37 Factors which militate against the making of the order the plaintiffs seek involve the nature of the action and the expected time before trial, together with what has occurred and might occur in terms of interlocutory proceedings. Delay before the final resolution of the principal action or principal matter is a significant factor; Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 952 at [24] ; Life Airbag Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Co (New Zealand) Ltd [1998] FCA 545. As to the present action, it remains one for damages in trespass. As I have noted, no issue of the implied constitutional freedom of communications is now raised at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 727">In addition to the authorities which I have mentioned, I refer to Spotwire Pty Ltd v Visa International Service Association (No 2) [2004] FCA 571 at [103] - [109] per Bennett J; IO Group Inc v Prestige Club Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1147 at [20] - [25] per Flick J; McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 at [13] - [20], [24], [41] per Weinberg J; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 952 at [24] per Gordon J; and Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [35]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1147">23 Even though declaratory and injunctive relief has been granted already, it is not considered that an order would have been made that such costs as are to be paid should be paid forthwith. The conduct of the litigation to date has certainly not been characterised by any degree of expedition; but the hearing of the balance of the proceeding and the resolution of all outstanding issues, it is anticipated, can be accommodated at a comparatively early date: cf Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 952 at [24] per Gordon J; Smart Co Pty Ltd v Clipsal Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1008 at [43] per Lander J. In such circumstances it is not considered that there should be a departure from the general principle that costs should be payable when the rights of the parties -- including any liability in damages -- are finally determined. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1008">43 There is no evidence that the respondents will suffer any serious disadvantage by not recovering their costs until the principal proceeding is determined. On the other hand, if the order were to be made, both parties would be put to the added expense of considering bills of costs in relation to the separate orders for costs to which reference has already been made. The applicant would need to find funds to pay those costs in advance of the hearing of the principal proceeding. It is desirable that the principal proceeding go forward as soon as possible because the principal proceeding raises important issues which need to be determined. Furthermore, this is not a proceeding where final judgment is "far away" and thus the eventuality of payment is remote: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Limited (No 3) [2008] FCA 952 at [24] per Gordon J and the cases cited therein.</sentence>
