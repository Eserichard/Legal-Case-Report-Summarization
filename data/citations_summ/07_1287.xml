 ORDERS
 
 (1) That there be an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the decision of the respondent made on 31 October 2007 not to revoke the cancellation of the applicant's Prospective Marriage (temporary) visa. In my view, the delegate did provide to the applicant the substance of the information from the community source and thereby met the obligation to accord procedural fairness to the applicant (see Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [28] at [7], [18] and [29]; Harrington v The Honourable Kevin Andrews MP, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [29] at [58], and Kumar v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [30] at [28]).  Further, Applicant VEAL was recently applied by Besanko J in Harrington v The Honourable Kevin Andrews MP, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [16] at [58], where his Honour found that the substance of non-disclosable information (parole reports) should have been disclosed to the applicant. </sentence>
