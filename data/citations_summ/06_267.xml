<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCAFC 205">4 These are appeals from a judge of this Court summarily dismissing applications by the appellants by way of appeals against the respondent's ("the Commissioner's") objection decisions in relation to the income tax assessment of Spassked Pty Limited ("Spassked") for the year ended 30 June 1994, the income tax assessments of IEL Finance Limited ("IEF") for the years ended 30 June 1993 and 1996 and the income tax assessment of Queensland Trading &amp; Holding Company Limited ("QTH") for the year ended 30 June 1991. The judgment of the primary judge is reported: [2006] FCA 267 ; (2006) 234 ALR 541 ; (2006) 62 ATR 165. </sentence>

In support of this he relied on what Kenny J. found in SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 267 (" SZDPY "), especially at [35]-[36], and which was subsequently applied by Heerey J. in VWBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; [2006] 154 FCR 302 (" VWBS "), and as considered recently by the Full Court in NBKT v Minister Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 (" NBKT "). 17.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1293">
 On 21 March 2006 I directed the parties to the four subject proceedings ( IEL Finance Limited and Others v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 267 ; (2006) 62 ATR 165) to provide draft declarations and/or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment delivered on that prior occasion. The first of those four proceedings, being numbered NSD 539 of 2004 and involving IEL Finance Limited as applicant, was treated by the parties as the precedent vehicle, for the most part, for implementation of orders to be made in the remaining three proceedings. The abbreviations adopted in these reasons reflect those used in the preceding principal reasons for judgment of 21 March 2006. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FCA 655">67 The Commissioner accepts that an issue estoppel can arise out of a judgment or order given on an appeal from an objection decision in relation to a particular year of income, which can be pleaded in a subsequent appeal in relation to a different year of income. Nevertheless, the prerequisites for the existence of an issue estoppel must be satisfied. That is to say, it must be demonstrated that the issue in respect of which an estoppel is raised is the same issue as was determined or, by necessary implication, must have been determined as between the parties in order for the earlier order or judgment to have been made or given. Thus, it must be established that the issue raised in a subsequent proceeding in respect of which an estoppel is pleaded was an issue the determination of which was an essential and fundamental step in leading to the judgment or order in the earlier proceeding. The issue might be one of fact or law or of mixed fact and law but it must be the same issue (see generally IEL Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 267). </sentence>
