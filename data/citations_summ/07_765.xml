<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1436">There are unquestionably instances where an argument has been permitted to be raised on appeal even though " unequivocally disclaimed " before the primary judge: e.g. CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 at [30] to [35] [2000] FCA 1539 ; , 52 IPR 42 at 57 to 60. In the specific context of migration cases, leave to raise on appeal an argument abandoned before a Federal Magistrate may thus be permitted where (for example) there has been " an error of judgment by [an appellant's] counsel in abandoning a point which had originally been taken, and which was plainly viable ": White v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 232 at [35] , [2000] FCA 232 ; 96 FCR 511 at 519; SZBLY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 765 at [36] , [2007] FCA 765 ; [2007] FCA 765 ; 96 ALD 70 at 77. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 857">The Tribunal' s s.424A letter was not expressed in terms which demonstrated that a fair minded and informed person might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal member would not bring an impartial mind to bear (cf SZKBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 317). I note in that respect that as Cowdroy J stated in SZBLY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 765 ; (2007) 96 ALD 70 at [25] (and see SZKBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 317 at [26] per Cowdroy J): " Because of the inquisitorial nature of Tribunal proceedings, the threshold for a finding of apprehended bias is necessarily higher than it is in curial proceedings" (and see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v MZXPA [2008] FCA 185 ; (2008) 100 ALD 312). Alerting the applicant to the fact that an adverse inference " may " be drawn is not indicative of prejudgment or such as to establish a " reasonable " apprehension of bias from the perspective of the hypothetical fair-minded and informed person ( Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v MZXPA [2008] FCA 185 ; (2008) 100 ALD 312 at [11] --- [19] per Sundberg J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 317">25 Another case to which I have been directed is the decision of Cowdroy J in SZBLY v The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 765. That was a case where a s 424A letter was sent but was not received by the appellant's agent, who was a solicitor, prior to the handing down by the Tribunal of its decision. The Tribunal had in its decision formed a view adverse to the appellant. It would appear that the Tribunal member had proposed to recall the decision and to reissue his invitation to comment on the s 424A information, that had been referred to in the letter which was never received. Apparently, the letter had been misdirected by the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 149">28 It was not disputed that the Court has ample power to allow both an amendment to a Notice of Appeal (see Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 28(1)(b) ; Federal Court Rules (Cth), O 13, r 2) and to allow further evidence, if appropriate, on the appeal (Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) s 27). The power is to be exercised in an appropriate case: see White v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 232 , 96 FCR 511 ; SZBLY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 765 , 96 ALD 70. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 1119">Mr Potts, for the Minister, properly drew to my attention the very recent decision of the Federal Court in SZBLY v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 765.</sentence>
