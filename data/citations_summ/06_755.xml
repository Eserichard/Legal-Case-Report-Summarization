<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 506">There are a number of authorities to the effect that an offer to settle on the basis that each party bares its own costs is not a Calderbank offer and, in any event, may not be considered a genuine offer of compromise: Nutrientwater Pty Ltd v Baco Pty Ltd (No 2) [2010] FCA 304 per Kenny J at [31] referring to Dresna Pty Ltd v Linknarf Management Services Pty Ltd (In liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 755 at [20] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 192 ; (2002) 201 ALR 618 at [59] - [60]; McKerlie v State of New South Wales (No 2) [2000] NSWSC 1159 ; Vasram v AMP Life Limited [2002] FCA 1286 at [12] ; and Fyna Foods Australia Pty Ltd v Cobannah Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1212 at [10] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 456">There are authorities to the effect that a defendant's offer to settle on the basis that each party bears it's own costs is not a Calderbank offer and in any event may not be considered a genuine offer of compromise: see Dresna Pty Ltd v Linknarf Management Services Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 755 at [20] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 192 ; (2002) 201 ALR 618 at [59] - [60] ; McKerlie v State of New South Wales (No 2) [2000] NSWSC 1159 ; Vasram v AMP Life Limited [2002] FCA 1286 at [12] ; and Fyna Foods Australia Pty Ltd v Cobannah Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1212 at [10] . It seems to me that the correct approach is to look at the extent of the offer of compromise, viewed with all the other relevant circumstances, to determine whether the rejection of the offer was unreasonable: see Aljade at [78] to [81] per Redlich J; Szencorp Pty Ltd v Clean Energy Council Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 196 at [15] per Goldberg J; Fyna Foods at [11]; Vasram at [13]; Nutrientwater Pty Ltd v Baco Pty Ltd (No 2) [2010] FCA 304 and Rosemin Pty Ltd v Gasp Jeans Chadstone Pty Ltd (No 2) [2010] FCA 406. This is how I have proceeded to consider this application for indemnity costs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 406">There are authorities to the effect that a respondent's offer to settle on the basis that each party bears it's own costs is not a Calderbank offer and in any event may not be considered a genuine offer of compromise: see Dresna Pty Ltd v Linknarf Management Services Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 755 at [20] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 192 ; (2002) 201 ALR 618 at [59] - [60]; McKerlie v New South Wales (No 2) [2000] NSWSC 1159 ; Vasram v AMP Life Limited [2002] FCA 1286 at [12] ; and Fyna Foods Australia Pty Ltd v Cobannah Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1212 at [10] . It seems to me that the correct approach is to look at the extent of the offer of compromise viewed with all the other relevant circumstances to determine whether the rejection of the offer was unreasonable: see Aljade and Malaysian Kuwaiti Investment Co SDN BHD (MKIC) v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd (OCBC) [2004] VSC 351 at [78] to [81] per Redlich J; Szencorp Pty Ltd v Clean Energy Council Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 196 at [15] per Goldberg J; Fyna Foods at [11]; Vasram at [13] and Nutrientwater Pty Ltd v Baco Pty Ltd (No 2) [2010] FCA 304. This is how I will proceed to consider this application for indemnity costs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 304">On no view could the offer be so described. Rather, the offer, even if not accurately described as just a 'walk away offer', was not far from such an offer. Save for Baco's modest payment of $3,000 to Nutrientwater, each party was to walk away from the proceeding bearing its own costs. There are authorities to the effect that a defendant's offer to settle on the basis that each party bears its own costs is not a Calderbank offer and, in any event, may not be considered a genuine offer of compromise: see Dresna Pty Ltd v Linknarf Management Services Pty Ltd (In liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 755 at [20] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 192 ; (2002) 201 ALR 618 at [59] - [60]; McKerlie v State of New South Wales (No 2) [2000] NSWSC 1159 ; Vasram v AMP Life Limited [2002] FCA 1286 at [12] ; and Fyna Foods Australia Pty Ltd v Cobannah Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1212 at [10] . It is unnecessary to consider whether these authorities directly assist here and whether a similar approach should apply in the context of O 23 r 11(6). It is sufficient to say that the extent of the compromise involved is a relevant consideration in determining whether there should be a departure from the prima facie position in r 11(6); or whether the rejection of the compromise offer was unreasonable or imprudent for common law purposes: compare Fyna Foods at [11] and Vasram at [13]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 196">That question gives rise to a threshold issue --- were the offers genuine offers of compromise? The plaintiff submitted that they were not genuine offers of compromise, but rather were "invitations to capitulate by discontinuing the proceedings on a basis that each party bear its own costs". There is support in a number of cases for the view that an offer by a defendant that a plaintiff discontinue the proceeding on the basis of each party bearing its own costs is not a genuine offer for the purpose of considering the effect of a Calderbank offer on a question of costs: McKerlie v State of New South Wales (No 2) [2000] NSWSC 1159 at [9] - [11]; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 192 at [59]- [64]; Vasram v AMP Life Limited [2002] FCA 1286 at [12] ; Fyna Foods Australia Pty Ltd v Cobannah Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1212 at [10] ; Jacomb v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical &amp; Services Union (supra) at [7]; Dresna Pty Ltd v Linknarf Management Services Pty Ltd (In Liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 755 at [20] . (The reasoning in Herning v GWS Machinery Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 375 and Townsend v Townsend (No 2) [2001] NSWCA 145 does not support the proposition that an offer by a defendant that the proceeding be discontinued with no order as to costs cannot be regarded as a genuine offer to compromise. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 965">21 The applicant referred to Dresna Pty Ltd v Linknarf Management Services Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 755 , where I said at [18] that the Court should not readily be persuaded that a case had no chance of success. The case in question had failed and, with hindsight, it might well have been anticipated that this was precisely what would occur. Nonetheless, there were some imponderables. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 42">18 On the occasion when the respondent's application for indemnity costs was heard in court, I invited the parties to file any further submission in writing, should they desire to do so, upon the subject of the relevance of the judgment of the Full Court in Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 40 ; (2007) 157 FCR 564 (regarding the availability of additional damages under s 115(4) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) notwithstanding that no more than nominal damages are otherwise awarded) and of the judgment of Weinberg J in Dresna Pty Ltd v Linknarf Management Services Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 755 as to the question whether an offer to settle on the following that each party bears his or her own costs can be regarded as a proper Calderbank offer). The parties availed themselves of that opportunity, although, in each case, the submissions filed were more extensive than the nature of the court's invitation required. As things have transpired, and for reasons which should be evident from what I have said above in these reasons, I have not found it necessary to refer to either such judgment. </sentence>
