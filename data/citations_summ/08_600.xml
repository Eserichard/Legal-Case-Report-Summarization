<citphrase id="cp13.15" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">migration act 1958 (cth), ss 6 , 6a. in an application for review of a decision of the minister for immigration and ethnic affairs made in 1984 refusing an application for a permanent entry permit to an applicant who was the spouse of a permanent resident on the basis that the applicant's marriage had been assessed as being one where the parties did not genuinely intend to continue living as a married couple in australia, it being the minister's policy to refuse permanent entry permits in such cases.  held: (1) that relevant considerations which should have been taken into account were not, thus making the minister's decision invalid pursuant to s 5(2)(b) of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (the act), such considerations being:  (i) a report made in 1981 by an interviewing officer in suva expressing an opinion that the marriage relationship was genuine, such report being part of the history of the relationship, all of which was relevant in determining the quality of the marriage as at the date of the minister deciding the application. although the report was not presented to the minister, it was on the departmental file and was accordingly to be regarded as being constructively before him.  peko-wallsend ltd v. minister for aboriginal affairs (1985) 59 alr 51 , referred to.  (ii) statutory declarations of neighbours and acquaintances as to the applicant leading a normal married life and a letter of a social worker as to the applicant's wife living at home with the applicant, such documents being available to the minister, but there being nothing to indicate that he had taken any account of them.  (2) that in determining whether an administrative decision made under statutory authority falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp13.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 147">According to the Minister's argument, Ms Lu's conscious choice not to respond to the Tribunal's invitation meant that its processes, or the exercise of its jurisdiction, were not relevantly "disabled. " In that sense, the present case was analogous to SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 600 ; (2008) 170 FCR 211 , where Middleton J, after noting, at [46], that "the appellant herself was complicit and knowingly involved in the decision to mislead the Tribunal as to her place of residence", observed, at [47]-[48]; 
 
 47 SZFDE [2007] HCA 35 ; 232 CLR 189 does not stand for the proposition that a failure by an applicant to attend the Tribunal hearing due to the fault or conduct of a third person bears the result that the Tribunal decision to proceed under s 426A of the Act is always vitiated by error. 48 This is a case where the appellant did not attend the Tribunal hearing due to a combination of factors --- her own lack of diligence, receipt of some misinformation or bad advice from a third party, and choosing after some persuasion not to attend. None of these matters amounts to fraud because there is no relevant 'fraudulent' conduct vis-&agrave;-vis the appellant. The real reason for the appellant not attending is not contained in the various matters particularised by the appellant in the Further Amended Notice of Appeal, but was the appellant's own decision not to attend. The appellant consciously consented to the Tribunal disposing of her case without her appearance, and in the circumstances the legislative scheme and processes of the Tribunal were not in any way disturbed. 
 

  In the respects which we have indicated, Ms Lu's choice not to respond to the Tribunal's invitation can be seen as motivated by her desire to pursue a different route to achieve her goal of obtaining a visa. Ms Lu acted at the behest of Ms Zhao to ignore the request of the Tribunal because she intended to "get around" it by paying a bribe. His Honour's finding that she did so because Ms Zhao's ruse was a fabrication cannot work to Ms Lu's advantage. Ms Lu was a conscious participant in what she understood was an attempt to subvert the outcome (affirmation by the Tribunal of the cancellation of her visa) that would occur because she chose not to respond to the Tribunal's invitation. The fact that Ms Lu was duped by Ms Zhao into thinking that Ms Zhao would facilitate payment of a bribe from Ms Lu's extravagant payments to her demonstrates that the Tribunal's processes were not affected by fraud. Rather, Ms Lu intended to engage in a fraud to "get around" the result in the Tribunal she knew her conduct would produce. This is similar to the choice made by the applicant in SZHVM [2008] FCA 600 ; 170 FCR 211 where Middleton J held, in the passage quoted at [22] above that the processes of the Tribunal had not been disturbed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 380">In SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 170 FCR 211 ; [2008] FCA 600 the appellant failed to attend a Tribunal hearing to which she had been invited because her migration agent, who had employed her as a nanny, directed her to look after his daughter at the time of the hearing. Middleton J held (at [54]) that although the migration agent " was just concerned about his own interests and put them above those of the appellant " such actions did not amount to fraud within SZFDE . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1159">It must be shown that the migration agent acted fraudulently, that is, acted dishonestly, stultifying the proceedings before the Tribunal and disabling the Tribunal from discharging its statutory functions in relation to the review. [138] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1302">Part 7 Division 4 of the Act provides a comprehensive procedural code in respect of the requirements of procedural fairness that must be accorded to review applicants in the conduct of reviews under that Division to the exclusion of the common law natural justice hearing rule: s 422B , SZMKG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 99 at [49] - [50]. There is no obligation on the Tribunal to ensure that any correspondence to the appellant is in his native language: SZGWH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 543 at [12] , SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 600 at [57] . The failure of the appellant to deal with the Tribunal's correspondence and attend the hearing are in no way actions constituting a denial of procedural fairness by the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 983">Fraud is not to be found simply on the basis of what should properly be characterised as bad or even negligent advice or conduct (see SZHBC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship at [17]-[18]; SZHZT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [35] at [3], [11] and [12]; SZFNX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [36] at [31]-[33]; SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [37] at [43]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 910">Thus, as discussed in SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 600 ; (2008) 170 FCR 211 at [53] : ... even if an act or omission of a migration agent misleads the applicant, and even directly affects the discharge of the Tribunal's statutory duties in a manner adverse to an applicant, it does not mean that the acts are to be characterised as dishonest or a fraud on the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 559">But before that omission can properly be said to have occasioned a fraud on the Tribunal, it must itself be able properly to be characterised as a fraudulent omission vis-&agrave;-vis the visa applicant: SZFDE , at [51]. The simple fact of a failure to inform or bare negligence or inadvertence will not necessarily be sufficient to give rise to fraud on the Tribunal" ( Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLIX (2008) 245 ALR 501 ; [2008] FCAFC 17 at [33] ). (4) An agent who places his or her own interests above that of the client is not necessarily engaged in a fraud, even if the conduct in question breaches the requirements of the Migration Act and Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth); what is required is "'fraudulent' conduct vis-&agrave;-vis the appellant" having the effect of disabling or stultifying the processes of the Tribunal ( SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 170 FCR 211 ; [2008] FCA 600 at [48] ). (5) Where a person is "complicit and knowingly involved in the decision to mislead the Tribunal" ( SZHVM at [46]), it may hardly be said that the person is fraudulently deceived in the sense that occurred in SZFDE ( SZLHP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 172 FCR 170 ; [2008] FCAFC 152 at [20] ). (6) Nevertheless, "there are many ways in which fraud may be manifested" ( SZIVK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 334 at [33] ).</sentence>

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCA 197">His Honour observed that the authorities subsequent to SZFDE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 232 CLR 189 , for example, Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZLIX [2008] FCAFC 17 ; (2008) 245 ALR 501 , SZLHP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 152 ; (2008) 172 FCR 170 and SZHVM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 600 ; (2008) 170 FCR 211 , emphasised the need for a careful formulation of allegations of fraud coming within the principles referred to by the High Court, as well as careful attention to the necessary causal relationships between the suggested fraud and the suggested inconsistency with statutory procedures. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 1553">In SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [26] at [47], Middleton J said: SZFDE does not stand for the proposition that a failure by an applicant to attend the Tribunal hearing due to the fault or conduct of a third person bears the result that the Tribunal decision to proceed under s 426A is always vitiated by error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 1529">In SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [22] at [47], Middleton J said: SZFDE does not stand for the proposition that a failure by an applicant to attend the Tribunal hearing due to the fault or conduct of a third person bears the result that the Tribunal decision to proceed under s 426A is always vitiated by error.  Ms Watson further referred the Court to the decision of Middleton J in SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [17] . In that case the appellant was working for the migration agent as a nanny. He told the applicant that she should not attend the hearing of the Refugee Review Tribunal because she had to look after the agent's child. Middleton J found that the agent was motivated by his personal desire to have the appellant look after his child for the day because it suited his personal needs and was in no way motivated to prevent the Tribunal from conducting a hearing. The circumstances were not such as to amount to fraud because there was no relevant fraudulent conduct vis-&agrave;-vis the appellant. [18] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 1417">Authorities subsequent to SZFDE have emphasised the need for a careful formulation of allegations of fraud coming within the principles referred to by the High Court, as well as careful attention to the necessary causal relationships between the suggested fraud and the suggested inconsistency with statutory procedures (see Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZLIX [2008] FCAFC 17 , SZLHP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 152 , and SZHVM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 600). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 1403">However, counsel for the Minister submitted that assuming the events which the applicant invites the Court to accept, they fall far short of establishing a jurisdictional defect in the procedures of the Tribunal leading to its decision, of the sort which has been explained by the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 232 CLR 189 (see also the recent discussion of those principles in SZLHP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 152 , Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZLIX [2008] FCAFC 17 , and SZHVM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 600). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FMCA 1239">The first respondent submitted that to establish fraud of the requisite kind it was necessary to prove a particular motivation, i.e. to prevent the Tribunal from conducting a hearing (see SZHVM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 600 at [42] ) or to deliberately stultify or disable the Tribunal's processes ( SZHVM at [44]) and that conduct short of that would be more properly characterised as bad advice (see SZHVM at [43] and cases cited therein). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FMCA 1211">SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 600 Allsop J described the test as 'in certain exceptional cases, a failure to make some inquiry ... if it was plainly necessary to make some reasonably straightforward inquiry before the making of the relevant decision' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FMCA 1162">One of the grounds of the application invokes principles established by the High Court in SZFDE &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 35. In that judgment, the High Court held that a Tribunal's decision may be invalid if a 'fraud', understood in a broad sense, adversely affected an applicant's involvement in the review proceeding in the Tribunal, and " had the immediate consequence of stultifying the operation of the legislative scheme to afford natural justice to that person" (see SZFDE at [49] and [51], and note the discussion of recent authorities by Middleton J in SZHVN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 600). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] FMCA 1140">In my opinion, the applicants have not established any facts which would satisfy the principles identified in the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 237 ALR 64. Those principles have been recently addressed in a number of cases, including a discussion by Middleton J in SZHVM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 600. As his Honour points out, the principles do not assist an applicant who has suffered only from the negligence or carelessness of his agent in presenting the applicant's claims. It is necessary to identify "fraud" by the agent, and also that it had a relevant immediate effect on the fairness of the Tribunal's decision-making process. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FMCA 1049">Moreover, even if it might be intended to suggest that there might in some way be in breach of such regulations or the Migration Act Middleton J stated in SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 600 , that even if there had been a breach of the regulations applicable to a migration agent this would not of itself lead to a finding of fraud in the relevant sense. In any event in the absence of further identification and evidence about "Solicitor Chang" this was not made out. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FMCA 840">Whatever the reason for the agent's failure to communicate the hearing appointment to the applicant, I am not satisfied that there was a fraud by the agent perpetrated on the Tribunal's procedures, allowing me to set aside the decision (see also the recent discussions of SZFDE in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZLIX [2008] FCAFC 17 and SZHVM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 600). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2008] FCA 755">In Applicant S [2004] HCA 25 ; 217 CLR 387 at [76] McHugh J said: If the Tribunal had considered the issue that it was legally required to consider, it was open to the Tribunal to investigate whether such a perception existed, whether within the Afghan society or some section of it, or objectively. Indeed, arguably in the context of its inquisitorial process, the Tribunal had a duty to seek evidence concerning this vital matter. Where there is material which on its face suggests that the Tribunal is not in receipt of all materials, the Tribunal should normally " take simple administrative steps to address the issue ": SZHVM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 600 at [63] per Middleton J.</sentence>
