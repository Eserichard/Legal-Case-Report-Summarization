<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 136">7 In my opinion, in this case I should follow the approach of Lindgren J. I also venture the view that, if s 31A had been in force at the time Lehane J gave his interlocutory decision, it more than likely would have been different. In short, I am not satisfied that this is one of those rare cases where it is appropriate to have this Court intervene by way of declaration in statutory process (see also in another context, Kamha v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (2007) 98 ALD 49 ; [2007] FCA 1422 at [9] and [13]). </sentence>
