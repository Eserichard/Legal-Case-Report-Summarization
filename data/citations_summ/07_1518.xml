<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 1556">9 So far as [8](1) is concerned that is the content of s 4(3)(f) of the Admiralty Act . Nor can there be any dispute about [8](2) --- the contract contained in the bill of lading relates to the carriage of goods on the CSCL Qingdao. So far as [8](3) is concerned, it should be noted that "arising out of" is a phrase of wide import. In The Antonis P Lemos [1985] AC 711 , the House of Lords held that it means "connected with" in the context of "any claim arising out of any agreement relating to the carriage of goods in a ship or to the use or hire of a ship," (being the words of s 20(2)(h) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (UK) ), and that the subsection was wide enough to cover claims in contract or tort and whether or not the agreement was made directly between the two parties to the action; see also Heilbrunn v Lightwood plc [2007] FCA 1518 ; (2007) 164 FCR 1 at [36] - [41] per Allsop J, as his Honour then was, applying The Antonis P Lemos. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 887">116 Reliance was placed by Mr Stevenson relies on Heilbrunn v Lightwood plc [2007] FCA 1518 ; (2007) 164 FCR 1 for the submission that the claim brought by Cargill for demurrage under a contract for the delivery of coal FOB to a ship (for the subsequent carriage of the coal by ship) was a maritime claim (and hence the exclusion clause is overridden). Mr Gleeson relies, inter alia, on The Zeus [1888] 13 PD 188 for the contrary conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1770">10 As Allsop J pointed out in Heilbrunn v Lightwood plc [2007] FCA 1518 ; (2007) 164 FCR 1 at 6-9 ([30]-[40]) s 4(3)(f) is to be given a wide and liberal construction in accordance with a similar view expressed by the House of Lords in The Antonis P Lemos [1985] AC 711 and Gatoil International Ltd v Arkwright-Boston Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company [1984] UKHL 8 ; [1985] AC 255. The Australian Law Reform Commission had referred to their Lordships' decisions in its Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction, Report No 33 (1986) (the ALRC report). Earlier, Foster J observed in Port of Geelong Authority v The "Bass Reefer" [1992] FCA 378 ; (1992) 37 FCR 374 at 380-382 showed the words of s 4(3)(f) are also similar to Article 1(1)(d) of the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Arrest of Seagoing Ships 1952 . In The St Elefterio [1957] P 179 at 183, Willmer J held that the English analogue to s 4(3)(f) encompassed a claim whether in contract or tort "arising out of any agreement relating to the carriage of goods in a ship" (emphasis added). In that case, he held that it gave the Court jurisdiction where a person allegedly made a fraudulent ante-dating of bills of lading.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] NSWSC 850">56 There was no answer by Baltship and REL to the carrier's contention that if clause 11 of the ocean bill applied, then the claim fell within s 4(3) of the Act. In Heilbrun v Lightwood PLC [2007] FCA 1518 [27], Allsop J applied the test identified in Owners of the Ship "Shin Kobe Maru" v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 54 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 at 422-426, namely whether the assertions made by the plaintiff had the legal character of what was contained in s 4(3)(f). In determining this, he applied Samick Lines Co Ltd v Owners of the Antonis P Lemos [1985] AC 711 , and Gatoil International Inc v Arkwright Boston Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co [1985] 255 dealing with analogous provisions, and held that a claim in tort (arising out of a warehousemen driving the vehicle which was to be carried on a sea voyage into a container and damaging the vehicle) was sufficiently connected with the agreement relating to sea carriage, and hence fell within s 4(3)(f). The requirements that the carrier's claim in this matter be connected with the agreement for carriage of goods and that the connection be reasonably direct, are both met here. </sentence>
