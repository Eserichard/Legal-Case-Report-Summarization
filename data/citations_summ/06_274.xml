<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 78">106 Finally, as Emmett J said in Glencore International AG v Takeovers Panel [2006] FCA 274 ; (2006) 151 FCR 77 at [135] :-
 ... Part 6.10 of the Act provides flexibility in the regulation of the acquisition of shares in circumstances where the literal operation of the regulatory regime is either unnecessarily restrictive or ineffective to achieve the object of Ch 6....  

75 In coming to this view, her Honour referred to the observations of Gleeson CJ in Alinta at [6] as to the purposes of the regulatory framework established by Chapter 6. Her Honour also pointed out that in Glencore International AG v Takeovers Panel [2006] FCA 274 ; (2006) 151 FCR 77 at [135] , Emmett J observed that s 657A(1) recognises that the conduct of a takeover may be inconsistent with an efficient, competitive and informed market even where there has been no contravention of the Corporations Act . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1572">38 The regulatory framework which Chapter 6 establishes is, as Gleeson CJ observed in Attorney General (Cth) v Alinta Ltd at 4, designed "to preserve an efficient, competitive and informed capital market". Section 657A(1) recognises that the conduct of a takeover may be inconsistent with such a market even where it does not contravene a specific provision of the Corporations Act . Emmett J recognised this in Glencore International AG v Takeovers Panel [2006] FCA 274 ; (2006) 151 FCR 77 at 108:
 The panel, of course, is expressly empowered by s 657A(1) to make declarations notwithstanding that there has been no contravention of the Act. Part 6.10 of the Act provides flexibility in the regulation of the acquisition of shares in circumstances where the literal operation of the regulatory regime is either unnecessarily restrictive or ineffective to achieve the object of Ch 6. It is clear enough that the regime involving the panel is designed to ensure regulation of the acquisition of shares over and above the provisions contained in the balance of Ch 6: ... The panel made its declaration because, notwithstanding compliance by Glencore and the Banks with the disclosure regime prescribed by the Act, the purposes of Ch 6, as expressed in s 602 , were not achieved. That is precisely the circumstance for which s 657A provides. It is not unreasonable for the panel, if its decision was otherwise lawful and authorised, to reach that conclusion. </sentence>
