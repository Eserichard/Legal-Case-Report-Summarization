<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] APO 26">The applicant argued, following Stena Rederi Aktiebolag v Austal Ships Sales Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 864 where it was found that a naval architect would not have been expected to ascertain the Journal of Ship Research, that it would not be reasonable to expect a farmer to use the Internet. In the applicant's submission, it followed that the PSA would not have ascertained Singh. While I have characterised the PSA somewhat differently, even if I had agreed with the applicant's position on the PSA, this submission seems to invoke the view that "farmers" do not turn to the Internet to solve their problems. Such a position seems to fly in the face of pronouncements that have been made on improving Internet performance for rural areas. Why improve something that is not needed? Indeed, a simple enquiry in any Internet search engine will reveal a multitude of web sites where farm supplies and machinery are found. It seems to me that, not only are farmers aware of the Internet, they make use of it and would like better performance.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] APO 18">I was referred to Stena Rederi Aktiebolag v Austral Ships Sales Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 864 at [21] --- [23]; [2007] FCA 864 ; (2007) 73 IPR 257 at 264, where Tamberlin J discussed the use of imprecise language in patent specifications. In the present case, I have been able to determine the meaning of the claims, so they do not lack clarity. Specifically, the terms "microemulsion", "average droplet size" and "mean pore size" appear to be clear.
