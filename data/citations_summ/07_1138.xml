<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 312">I am satisfied that, in the particular circumstance of his case [19] , Mr Kemp's deliberate decision not to wear a seat belt was conduct which was attended by the risk of non-trivial injury and which significantly increased the likelihood of such injury. Accordingly, I am satisfied that, in accordance with s 14(3) of the Act, compensation is not payable to Mr Kemp in relation to the back strain he sustained on 20 May 2008. 
  Also, in Inco Ships Pty Ltd v Hardman the Federal Court stated that misconduct "is serious if it significantly increases the likelihood of serious injury". [18]  The evidence of Mr Skelding was that there was a real risk of a vehicle roll-over while negotiating the left turn on the haul road because of its acute angle. On that evidence, the risk of a roll-over was higher than would be the case of a properly designed and constructed corner and, in that sense, I am satisfied that it was an abnormal risk. I am also satisfied that the risk of injury by an occupant of a vehicle is increased where the occupant is not restrained in the vehicle by a seat belt. Mr Kemp dismissed as 'ludicrous' the suggestion that he knew there was risk of injury from driving his truck into the corner at excessive speed and without wearing a seat belt. I do not accept his evidence in that regard. In his statement at KG1, Mr Kemp described himself as having been "thrown about the cab" and forwards into the windscreen, an unsurprising consequence of the absence of a seat belt and one which was causally associated [11] with his back injury. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1044">It is s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act which entrusts to the Tribunal --- and not this Court --- the task of providing in writing a statement of reasons that " include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based ". Subject to s 44(7) of the same Act, it is not the task of this Court, on appeal, to itself make findings of fact which may support an alternative basis upon which the Tribunal may have reached the same conclusion. Where a factual issue has not been fully explored before the Tribunal, care must be exercised before this Court invokes the power conferred by s 44(7) to make additional findings of fact: See Inco Ships Pty Ltd v Finlay Murdoch Hardman [2007] FCA 1138 , 167 FCR 294. Mansfield J there observed:
 
 
 [71] ... As its contentions indicate, there was some medical evidence considering the relationship between the degenerative conditions of the respondent's right knee and his left knee. The issue was not fully explored because, in the particular circumstances, it was not a matter upon which the Tribunal was required to make, or made, a finding favourable to the contention of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] AATA 450">In relation to the second principle set out in the preceding paragraph, Counsel for Mr Caldwell referred us to the Federal Court decision of Inco Ships Pty Ltd v Hardman [2007] FCA 1138 in which Madgwick J stated that misconduct is serious "if it significantly increases the likelihood of serious injury. " [33] For reasons to which we shall refer later, the difference in these two approaches is immaterial in the case before us.
