<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1134">In reaching its conclusion about the correct interpretation of factor 6(i), the Tribunal referred to two judgments of this Court. The first was Kattenberg v Repatriation Commission [2002] FCA 412 , 34 AAR 562 (" Kattenberg "), where the Court held that the Tribunal had erred in law in holding (with regard to an SoP regarding intervertebral disc prolapse) that a factor requiring the smoking of at least 30 pack years of cigarettes before clinical onset signified that the 30 pack years must have occurred during service. The second was Repatriation Commission v Newson [2008] FCA 401 (" Newson ") which relates to SOPs on osteoarthrosis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 929">" 
 
The second ground of appeal is then made out, that the service element of a disease process need only make a material contribution to the ultimate disease was made clear by the later decision of Repatriation Commission v Newton (2008) FCA 401.</sentence>
