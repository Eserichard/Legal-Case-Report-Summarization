<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 697">Under sub-rule (1), the power extends to any judgment or order before it has been entered. After entry, the power is limited to stipulated cases which include the case where the order is interlocutory: see sub-rule (2)(c). In each case, the power is discretionary, and the authorities in this Court indicate that it is ordinarily only exercised in exceptional circumstances: see Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 at 549-552; Dudzinski v Centrelink [2003] FCA 308 (' Dudzinski' ) at [11]; and McDermott v Richmond Sales Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 248 at [25] . Where the order has not been entered, an order varying or setting aside the terms of a judgment can also be made to correct error or oversight or to give effect to a review of the contemplated order so that the orders made more adequately deal with the matter as litigated before the Court: Yenald Nominees Pty Ltd v Como Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 18 ATPR 41-508. 
 

 
 
 5 The authorities indicate that the kind of exceptional circumstances that might attract the power of discharge or variation include where an interlocutory order was obtained by fraud or non-disclosure of material facts, or through an accident or mistake that occurred without the fault of the parties seeking the relief under O 35 r 7: see Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 at 549-551.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 250">The essential distinction is whether the issue determined was final or interlocutory as to the matter which it covers. [17] Thus, where a hearing is split between determination of liability and determination of damages a judgment as to liability is final and not interlocutory. [18] Put differently, where the judgment did not finally determine the rights of the parties that were in issue in the proceedings, it is interlocutory. [19] An order is final if it finally determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them. [20] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 290">In Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 2) 152 IR 352 , a second interlocutory application in the proceeding sought a discharge or stay of a interlocutory injunction already granted by the Court. Young J referred to the Court's discretionary power to vary or set aside an entered interlocutory order under O 35 r 7(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules (Cth) and said at [4]: 
 
 In each case, the power is discretionary, and the authorities in this Court indicate that it is ordinarily only exercised in exceptional circumstances: see Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 at 549-552; Dudzinski v Centrelink [2003] FCA 308 at [11] ; and McDermott v Richmond Sales Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 248 at [25] . 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 304">13 I should also note that to the extent that it was thought that granting liberty to apply would affect the finality of the orders, this was not correct. As Kenny J observed in McDermott v Richmond Sales Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2006] FCA 248 at [22] :
 
 Moreover, it is settled law that orders may be final even though the Court reserves liberty to apply: see, e.g., Abigroup Limited v Abignano [1992] FCA 567 ; (1992) 39 FCR 74 at 87-88 per Lockhart, Morling and Gummow JJ ; Comcare v Grimes [1994] FCA 1054 ; (1994) 50 FCR 60 at 61-62 per Wilcox J; Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority (No 3) (2001) 106 IR 119 at 122-125 per Nicholson J; and Nicholson v Nicholson [1974] 2 NSWLR 59 at 63 per Jenkyn J. These cases reveal that liberty to apply does not render a final order any less final: see further Neil J Williams, Civil Procedure at [I 59.01.20] and the cases cited therein. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1526">33 Although references occur in the Authorities to the 'inherent jurisdiction' of the Court ( McDermott v Richmond Sales (in liq) [2006] FCA 248 , per Kenny J; Plantagenet Wines v Lyon Nathan Wine Group Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 247 , per Sciopis J) the term is an inaccurate description of the 'incidental and necessary power' exercised by a statutory court ( DJL v Central Authority [2000] HCA 17 ; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at 241[25], per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron J, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) as the term 'inherent jurisdiction' is a reference to a jurisdiction subsisting 'without the aid of any authorising provisions' ( R v Forbes ; ex parte Bevan per Menzies J, at p 7). The distinction between a jurisdiction or power derived by implication from statutory provisions and a jurisdiction drawn from the 'well of undefined powers available to the common law courts at Westminster'( Grassby v The Queen [1989] HCA 45 ; (1989) 168 CLR 1 at 16) is 'fundamental' ( DJL v Central Authority [26]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 652">4 The first issue which arises concerns the application to discharge the injunctive order made on 19 May 2006. There is a preliminary question as to the circumstances that must be demonstrated before a court would consider varying or discharging an interlocutory injunction. Under O 35 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules , the Court has power to vary or set aside an order. Under sub-rule (1), the power extends to any judgment or order before it has been entered. After entry, the power is limited to stipulated cases which include the case where the order is interlocutory: see sub-rule (2)(c). In each case, the power is discretionary, and the authorities in this Court indicate that it is ordinarily only exercised in exceptional circumstances: see Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 at 549-552; Dudzinski v Centrelink [2003] FCA 308 (' Dudzinski' ) at [11]; and McDermott v Richmond Sales Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 248 at [25] . Where the order has not been entered, an order varying or setting aside the terms of a judgment can also be made to correct error or oversight or to give effect to a review of the contemplated order so that the orders made more adequately deal with the matter as litigated before the Court: Yenald Nominees Pty Ltd v Como Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 18 ATPR 41-508. </sentence>
