<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 415"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 474">15 Mr David Clark and his wife, Helen Clark, are taxpayers who have applied to the Federal Court of Australia (Applications 500/2006 and 501/2006 respectively) in the Court's original jurisdiction conferred by s 14ZZ of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) by way of an appeal from a decision of the Commissioner of Taxation made on 27 October 2006 to disallow objections to an amended assessment issued to each taxpayer on 25 November 2005 for the year ending 30 June 2001. Those applications involve a number of questions including whether each taxpayer is entitled to take advantage of capital losses in the Carringbush Trust by reason of the disposal of the Rothwells shares so as to offset capital gains derived by the trust from other projects ( Clark v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1426). In those proceedings, the Commissioner of Taxation takes the position that s 468(1) of the Corporations Act renders the disposition void (among a range of other arguments) with the result that no capital loss arises in any event. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 48">

At 221 Mason J said that because the taxpayer has to prove that the Commissioner's assessment is excessive:
 
 ... the relevant facts in the appeal include the view of the facts on which the Commissioner has based his assessment, the manner in which he arrived at his assessment. These facts are not within the knowledge of the taxpayer; they are within the knowledge of the Commissioner. 

More recently, Greenwood J expressed a similar view in Clark v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1426 at [37] . Jacobs J acknowledged in Bailey that particulars are essentially factual rather than legal, however his Honour recognised that for a request for particulars to be appropriately directed to the matter in dispute the issues must be sufficiently defined. At 221-2, his Honour made the following comment:
 
 ... when there are no sufficiently defined issues it is not always possible to obtain particulars of facts without first ascertaining whether those facts will be relevant to questions which may be raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 37">14 The applicant seeks to sidestep these problems by relying upon the Commissioner's appeal statement required by O 52B r 5 of the Federal Court Rules . It is submitted that, on the basis that all the facts asserted in the appeal statement are accepted, the applicant can demonstrate that it will carry the burden of proof of establishing that the declaration should not have been made. The applicant relies upon the decision of Sundberg J in Rio Tinto Ltd v Federal Commission of Taxation [2004] FCA 335 ; (2004) 55 ATR 321 particularly at [31] and [58] that underlines the importance of the appeal statement and the necessity for it to fully state the basis of the relevant decision, and refers to Clark v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1426 at [37] . It is submitted for the Commissioner that an appeal statement should not be used in this way.</sentence>
