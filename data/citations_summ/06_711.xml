<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1603">42 Seventh, in Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Limited [2006] FCA 711 , which concerned discovered documents, Finkelstein J held that disclosure to a litigation funder was not caught by the implied undertaking. His Honour's reason was that a litigation funder, although not a party, was not a stranger to the proceeding and had a sufficient interest to be provided with the documents, or at least to those documents it needed in order to assess the merits of the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 244">19 In Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Store Ltd [2006] FCA 711 , Finkelstein J, faced with a similar application in relation to the same litigation funder said (at [6] and [7]):
 
 [6] The view that I take is that the implied undertaking does not prevent absolutely a party giving discovered documents to a non-party. There are circumstances in which a party has a legitimate interest in disclosing discovered documents to a non-party. Obvious examples include showing a discovered document to an actual or prospective witness or to an expert non-witness. 

24 In a letter dated 10 November 2006 Mr Rollnik wrote to the solicitors for the Ericsson parties stating that they were instructed that IMF had a funding agreement with the applicants and "a recognised interest in this dispute". He referred to Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 711. In a further letter dated 29 November 2006 he described IMF's purpose in accessing the discovery as being "to look after its interest in the litigation as set out in the Funding Agreement".</sentence>
