<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 17">Lastly, the orders should not have been made in their form because, in their form, they are far too wide. No order requiring a party to do something which contains a latent ambiguity should be made because the party to whom the order is directed may be charged with contempt for disobedience of that order: Australian Consolidated Press Limited v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 ; Australian Corporation and Consumer Commission v Dynacast (Int) Pty Ltd (formerly Phoneflasher.com Pty Ltd) ACN 061 234 642 [2007] FCA 429. In this case, the first and second appellants were called upon to destroy all CFMEU Code of Conduct Union Delegates forms in their custody, possession or control which contained the offending words. Read literally, that requires the first and second appellants to destroy all completed forms over a period which is unknown since the form was first created. It also requires the first and second appellants to obtain from any delegate or organiser or any other officer of the Union both completed and uncompleted forms if the first and second appellants have the power to require delegates to return those forms to them. The orders are not limited to the destruction of unused or uncompleted forms. The orders are too wide for the purpose for which they were made. </sentence>
