<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 425">The real issue in this case arises from the show cause order I made on 9 April 2010. The Minister deals with that issue in the following terms: On 9 April 2010 the Court ordered that the Minister show cause why relief should not be granted in relation to the manner in which the Tribunal tested the Applicant's religious faith. The Tribunal was entitled to explore the Applicant's knowledge of Christianity, given his claims to have studied the Bible and attended church regularly in both China and Australia: SBCC v MIMA [2006] FCAFC 129 at [45] ; WALT v MIMA [2007] FCAFC 2 at [30] , and its doing so is no evidence of apprehended bias: SZNLJ v MIAC [2009] FCA 1414 (Bennett J) at [31]; SZJBD v MIAC [2009] FCAFC 106 at [80-88] per Buchanan J, [107] per Perram J; SZOBA v MIAC [2010] FCA 99 (Driver FM). Moreover the Applicant's religious knowledge was only one of a number of matters that concerned the Tribunal, and the Applicant did not respond in writing to the Tribunal's concerns expressed at the hearing (including as to his religious knowledge), despite claiming that he would: CB 98-100 [48-56]. In these circumstances it was open for the Tribunal to find that the Applicant did not have the knowledge of the Bible that might reasonably be expected of a person with the religious background that he claimed: CB 104 [74]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 99">The Minister's submissions relating to these issues are set out at paragraphs 7 and 8 of the outline of written submissions: The first ground claims that the Tribunal was unfair in questioning the Applicant about his knowledge of the Bible and that he had been nervous. The Tribunal was entitled to explore the Applicant's knowledge of his claimed religion: SBCC v MIMA [2006] FCAFC 129 at [45] ; WALT v MIMA [2007] FCAFC 2 at [30] ; SZNLJ v MIAC [2009] FCA 1414 (Bennett J) at [31], especially given the Applicant's initial claim that he attended the Local Church every Sunday since an early age and read the Bible every day. It considered the Applicant's claim that he was nervous, but found that this did not explain his lack of knowledge of Local Church beliefs and practices: CB 117 [95]. In any case, the Applicant's level of knowledge was but one of many difficulties the Tribunal had with his evidence that cumulatively led it to find he was untruthful and had fabricated his claims: see para 4 above. There was nothing unfair about the Tribunal's procedure (and even if there were this would not amount to a jurisdictional error given s 422B(1) of the Act). The second ground seems to take issue with the Tribunal's assessment of independent country information concerning an internet firewall in China (CB 118 [102-103]), but this is a factual matter for the Tribunal: NAHI v MIMA [2004] FCAFC 10 at [11-13] , and in any case again was one of only a number of difficulties it had with the Applicant's evidence. This ground at most seeks merits review. </sentence>
