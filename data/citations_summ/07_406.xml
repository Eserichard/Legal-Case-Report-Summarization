<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1535">17 In Mines v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 1331 ; (2004) 86 ALD 62 Gray J said (at 74) that:
 "If the question is posed as whether a veteran has suffered PTSD as a result of a traumatic event said to have occurred during the veteran's operational service, it must be answered by saying that the decision-maker must be reasonably satisfied that the traumatic event occurred before reaching the conclusion that the veteran suffered PTSD. Only if such a conclusion is reached does the reasonable hypothesis process of reasoning, outlined in the four steps referred to in Deledio, come into operation. " (Emphasis added) 
See also Fenner v Repatriation Commission [2007] FCA 406 at [63] ; Repatriation Commission v Hill [2008] FCA 50 at [104] - [106].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] AATA 163">I note that with respect to the final step in Deledio, Mansfield J (in Fenner v Repatriation Commission [2007] FCA 406) observed that the requirement at this step of proof beyond reasonable doubt requires a high standard of disproof, once there is a reasonable hypothesis at step 3. I regard those remarks as relevant here. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] AATA 1665">The evidence suggests that Mr Fanna buried these memories for much of his life. I was satisfied that the substance of Mr Fanna's claim as it relates to stressful experiences during his service in Thailand has foundation and is supported by the Writeway research. I accept Mr Fanna's evidence. I accept also that he has learned to understand the content of his nightmares about these stressful events through information provided to him by others who were there. The Writeway report provides much support for what Mr Fanna says happened on guard duty. As Mansfield J pointed out in Fenner v Repatriation Commission [2007] FCA 406 the fact that evidence is exaggerated or even fabricated does not necessarily mean that a person was not afraid when they experienced stressors, and there is in Mr Fanna's case no evidence that he is fabricating or exaggerating. </sentence>
