<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWCA 60">However, the cases have recognised that the commercial or contractual responsibilities of government, once entered, may well be able to be treated differently to questions of policy. To the extent that the executive branch of government participates in contractual arrangements and commercial undertakings (in the advancement of the public interest), there is much to be said for the proposition (present elsewhere in the legal system eg the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), s 64) that it should be treated like any other litigant in a commercial dispute in which it finds itself: cf Robinson v South Australia (No 2) [1931] AC 704 at 715; Harbours Corporation of Queensland v Vessey Chemicals Pty Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 60 at 63-64; Hooker Corporation Ltd v Darling Harbour Authority (1987) 14 ALD 110 ; Carey v Ontario [1986] 2 SCR 637 at [82]-[84]; Adelaide Brighton Cement Ltd v South Australia [1999] SASC 379 ; 75 SASR 209 ; Sportsbet Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No 3) [2009] FCA 1283 ; 262 ALR 27 at 38 [39] . These cases reveal that whilst not a hard and fast consideration, the commercial character of a contract as the subject matter of a document is an important consideration in the balancing exercise. In particular, consideration of a specific contractual dispute or of particular facts relevant to that dispute may require a different approach than consideration of whether a government should become involved in a proposed project. In this respect, an important consideration in the due administration of justice is the denial of any possible perception that the government is in a privileged position in how it litigates its commercial rights and entitlements against citizens, in the absence of demonstration of a proper basis of interest of a character that attracts the immunity. There are many circumstances where policy has got nothing to do with a decision by government as to a step in a commercial arrangement or dispute. There are other circumstances where commercial decision-making and policy can intersect.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 196">There is also authority to indicate that the term "proceedings in Parliament" extends to proceedings in parliamentary committees: see eg R v Murphy (1986) 5 NSWLR 18 at 25 per Hunt J; Cornwall v Rowan [2004] SASC 384 ; (2004) 90 SASR 269 at [387] - [389] per Bleby, Besanko and Sulan JJ. The identification of what constitutes proceedings in Parliament is a practical one, rather than one driven by artificial and narrow lines: R v Chaytor [2010] UKSC 52 at [47] per Lord Phillips. In Sportsbet Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No 3) [2009] FCA 1283 ; (2009) 262 ALR 27 ( Sportsbet (No 3) ) at [19] and [21] adopted such an approach. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] NSWSC 142">119 My conclusion as to the scope of Rowley v O'Chee is generally consistent with the judgment Jagot J in Sportsbet Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No 3) [2009] FCA 1283 , at [19] and [21], though the issues in that case are rather different from the present case.</sentence>
