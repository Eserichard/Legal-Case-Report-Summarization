<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1586">Jobern [2007] FCA 1066 involved a contractual dispute where the parties had executed a document entitled 'Heads of Agreement' (HofA), clause 3.3 of which stated: "Each party will conduct all such negotiations in good faith to ensure that the terms set out in these Heads of Agreement are given full effect". It was not in dispute in Jobern that the parties were bound by the HoFA, which Gordon J stated to be a final agreement within the first category described in Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; 91 CLR 353 at [106] . However Gordon J considered that cl 3.3 was uncertain because it suffered from the same problems referred to by Kirby J in Coal Cliff Collieries 24 NSWLR 1 at [130].  ASIC relies upon the following authorities in support of its submission that the framework agreements are bare agreements to negotiate the scope and terms, in each case, of a further agreement to build transfer and finance the relevant Project infrastructure and that such agreements are not enforceable: Coal Cliff Collieries Pty Ltd v Sijehama Pty Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 1 ; Jobern Pty Ltd v Breakfree Resorts (Victoria) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1066 ; Walford v Miles [1992] 2 AC 128.  In my view Coal Cliff Collieries 24 NSWLR 1 , Jobern [2007] FCA 1066 and Walford [1992] 2 AC 128 do not assist ASIC. I do not take Coal Cliff Collieries as authority for the proposition that a bare agreement to negotiate in good faith is not enforceable, as submitted by ASIC. In my view, that case is authority for the proposition that a promise to negotiate in good faith may, in particular circumstances, be enforceable, depending on the precise terms as construed from the contract. In Jobern [2007] FCA 1066 , it was not in dispute that the heads of agreement document was binding --- only the negotiation clause was held to be uncertain. In Walford [1992] 2 AC 128 , the agreement that was found to be uncertain was a 'lock-in' agreement committing the parties to negotiate with each other, which is to be distinguished from the types of obligations found in the framework agreements under consideration in the present case.  In my view Coal Cliff Collieries 24 NSWLR 1 , Jobern [2007] FCA 1066 and Walford [1992] 2 AC 128 do not assist ASIC. I do not take Coal Cliff Collieries as authority for the proposition that a bare agreement to negotiate in good faith is not enforceable, as submitted by ASIC.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] SAIRC 62">63 Mr Short submitted that Futuris had acted in good faith. Whilst I accept that would be a relevant factor, as with the mistake submission there is no evidence that Futuris took reasonable steps to genuinely attempt to comply, with appropriate checking through available resources, with both the contract of employment and with the Workplace Relations Act , or that it had loyally adhered to that which had been promised in the termination letter. [12] What the evidence does show is a deliberate position taken to withhold an acknowledged contractual entitlement until the deed was signed. The entitlement was used as leverage to achieve a collateral benefit of enhancing the value of its severance offer in the context of uncertainty and potential disagreement as to the correct contractual entitlement to severance benefits. Whilst I do not make a finding of bad faith, the evidence does not support a positive finding of good faith as to the three elements of intention, conduct and content.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] VSC 539">[105] (1994) 122 ALR 615 (FC) at 635-636. [106] But see Chitty on Contracts, 29 th edition, 2004 at [15-046], [15-049]; compare S. Smith, Atiyah's Introduction to the Law of Contract, 2005 at 322-324; J. Beatson, Anson's Law of Contract, 28 th edition, 2002 at 300-307. In relation to the amorphousness of the concept of "good faith" generally, see Aiton Australia Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd [1999] NSW 996 (Einstein J) [1999] NSWSC 996 ; (1999) 153 FLR 236 at [129] , together with similar observations quoted by Gordon J in Jobern Pty Ltd v BreakFree Resorts (Victoria) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1066 at [136] - [141]. [107] See, eg F. Zumbo, Dealing with unfair terms in consumer contracts: Is Australia falling behind? (2005) 13 TPLJ 70 at 71-72; F. Zumbo, Dealing with unfair terms in consumer contracts: The search for a new regulatory model (2005) 13 TPLJ 194 at 194, 204. The legislation proceeds on the assumption that some terms in consumer contracts, especially in standard form consumer contracts, may be inherently unfair. 116 To my mind, the precise meaning of the "good faith" element in s 32W is by no means as clear as one would wish. [110] At least so far as the Victorian legislation is concerned, I do not share Lord Bingham's easy confidence in that particular regard. [111] As his Lordship himself noted, although the test laid down by the UK regulations derives from the EEC Directive, the member states of the European Union have no common concept of fairness or good faith. 117 Nevertheless, the wording of s 32W itself, including the expression "contrary to the requirements of good faith", is so strikingly close to that of the corresponding provisions of the EEC Directive and of the 1994 and 1999 UK regulations that Parliament should be taken to have intended that the expression should receive a reasonably similar interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] WASCA 33">250 Agreements to negotiate in good faith have been the subject of considerable discussion in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand: see, in the United Kingdom, Walford v Miles [1992] 2 AC 128 ; in New Zealand, Wellington City Council v Body Corporate 51702 [2002] 3 NZLR 486 and, in Australia, Coal Cliff Collieries Pty Ltd v Sijehama Pty Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 1 ; Australis Media Holdings Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd (1998) 43 NSWLR 104 ; Con Kallergis Pty Ltd v Calshonie Pty Ltd (1998) 14 BCL 201 and Jobern Pty Ltd v BreakFree Resorts (Victoria) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1066. Also relevant, in Australia, are Hooper Bailie Associated Ltd v Natcon Group Pty Ltd (1992) 28 NSWLR 194 ; Elizabeth Bay Developments Pty Ltd v Boral Building Services Pty Ltd (1995) 36 NSWLR 709 ; Aiton Australia Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 996 ; (1999) 153 FLR 236 and Laing O'Rourke v Transport Infrastructure [2007] NSWSC 723 , all of which deal with agreements to negotiate in good faith with a view to resolving a dispute. These cases raise complex issues, none of which was mentioned, let alone debated, in the proceedings before the trial judge. For example, it has been questioned whether an agreement in the terms contended for is sufficiently certain to be enforceable (see, in this respect, Australis Media Holdings (126 - 129)). Also, it is questionable whether an agreement of that kind is capable of supporting an implied obligation to cooperate of the kind contended for (see Australis Media Holdings (124)). </sentence>
