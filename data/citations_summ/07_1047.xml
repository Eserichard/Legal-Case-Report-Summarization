("tillmanns"), was a wholesale and retail butcher carrying on business in canberra and queanbeyan. the first-named respondent, the australasian meat industry employees' union ("the union") was an organization of employees including employees of wholesale and retail butchers and employees in abattoirs. the third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents were the president, secretary and two organizers of the union respectively. in december 1977 two of the respondents entered tillmannss' shop in queanbeyan and asked to see the employees. the request was refused by tillmanns' managing director because it was neither smoko nor lunchtime. the union retaliated by imposing a black ban upon tillmanns' shops. at that time canberra abattoir pty. ltd. ("canberra abattoir"), a company which conducted an abattoir in the australian capital territory, held for tillmanns thirty-two cattle awaiting slaughter and the carcasses of twenty head of cattle and seventeen pigs. as a result of the black ban by the union the live cattle were not slaughtered for some weeks and the carcasses were released to tillmanns only about a week later to avoid deterioration. the appellant instituted an action in the federal court of australia seeking an injunction and damages under ss. 80 and 82 in relation to s. 45d of the trade practices act 1974 ("the act ") alleging that the respondents acted in concert to prevent supplies of meat to tillmanns in breach of s. 45d of the act . the trial judge declined to find that the respondents' conduct had the relevant effect and refused to award damages or to grant an injunction. he stated in his judgment, inter alia, that the plaintiff (appellant) was not entitled to argue that the conduct complained of would be likely to cause substantial loss where the means of proving whether in fact it did cause substantial loss were in its power. the appellant appealed to the full court of the federal court of australia against this judgment claiming that an injunction should have been ordered.  held: per curiam</citphrase>

In the result, the evidence as to both liability and damages would be heard together. I would then publish reasons for judgment addressing the liability of the respondents for the tortious and statutory claims. I would also assess what damages or other compensation should be paid to Qantas. If a further hearing was necessary to determine penalties, that would occur. Final orders would then be made. During final submissions in the first stage the parties agreed to a proposal advanced by me that any judgment dealing with the quantification of damages would follow a judgment on liability which also dealt with damages but only at a level of principle. </sentence>

(1) Lane, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW contravened s 170NC of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (Pre-Reform). It is now common ground that no case of such breach was pleaded against CFMEU NSW. (2) Lane, Primmer, Kelly, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW contravened s 45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). (3) Lane, Primmer, Kelly, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW interfered with the contract between LGB and Silvestri P/L. 3 The respondents contend that the contract between LGB and Silvestri P/L was an hourly hire and that damages should not exceed compensation for more than two hours' work. I disagree. Both parties to the contract understood that the job entailed all of the excavation required at the site. I so held in the judgment on liability ( A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1047 ; (2007) 165 IR 94 at [83] ). The benefit of that arrangement was denied by reason of the wrongful actions of the respondents. </sentence>
