<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1849">3 I set out the general nature of the facts alleged in the amended statement of claim in my reasons for judgment on an earlier pleading dispute: see Stoyef v Masu Financial Management Pty Ltd (2008) 66 ACSR 585 ; [2008] FCA 897. It suffices for present purposes to note that:
 
 
 &#8226; Mr Stoyef brought the proceeding as a representative party;
 &#8226; he and the group members are persons who were clients of a financial services business conducted by the respondent (Masu) and who, in reliance on advice given by Masu, invested in one or more "Westpoint Products" as defined in para 2(b) of the amended statement of claim, and "suffered loss" as a result; 
 &#8226; excluded from the group members are persons who were represented in another specified proceeding against Masu or who had brought any other proceeding against it in respect of circumstances similar to those referred to; and
 &#8226; generally speaking, the Westpoint Products were defined as financial products in the nature of promissory notes issued by Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd (Westpoint) or by other entities within the group of companies known as the Westpoint Group (Westpoint entities). </sentence>
