<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 182">That is not to diminish the importance of the judicial review function in maintaining the rule of law. As Brennan J said in Woodward (at 70), judicial review "is neither more nor less than the enforcement of the rule of law over executive action; it is the means by which executive action is prevented from exceeding the powers and functions assigned to the executive by law and the interests of the individual are protected accordingly ..." The importance that this Court and other courts in the common law world attach to their judicial review functions was essayed by Spender J in his reasons for decision in Haneef v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1273 ; (2007) 161 FCR 40 at 44-53. It is not consistent with the rule of law for any government agency, including security organisations, to be immune from judicial review. This truism has been articulated in many judicial pronouncements, including cases where disclosure of evidence was resisted on the grounds that such disclosure would prejudice national security: see, for example, Woodward at 55 (per Mason J), 70 (per Brennan J) and, implicitly, by the Full Court of this Court in Leghaei . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] SASC 265">The case of Haneef v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship , [14] "Haneef's case", was a decision of a Judge of the Federal Court, which involved a consideration of the reasoning of the High Court in Plaintiff S157 , [15] concerning the privative clause found in the Migration Act 1956 (Cth) that purported to exclude judicial review, and the Constitutional validity of that clause. The affidavit material of Mr Ferdinands in the present proceeding suggests that he seeks to draw an analogy between section 46(8) of the Police (Complaints and Disciplinary Proceedings) Act and Haneef's case . As earlier extracted, section 46(8) in no way purports to oust judicial review --- it merely states that no appeal will lie against a decision of the Court made under that section. The analogy sought to be drawn by Mr Ferdinands is unsound. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 97">114 The failure to take into account relevant considerations and the taking into account of irrelevant considerations may also constitute jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 at [82] , [2001] HCA 30 ; 206 CLR 323 at 351 per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. The observations there made have since been repeatedly cited and applied by Judges of this Court: e.g., Haneef v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1273 , 161 FCR 40 at [126] to [127] per Spender J (aff'd on appeal: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Haneef [2007] FCAFC 203 , 163 FCR 414). See also: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v JSFD [2010] FCA 569 at [34] per Marshall J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 827">54 An " improper purpose ", it has been said, " will not lightly be inferred and, by application of a presumption of regularity, will only be inferred if the evidence cannot be reconciled with the proper exercise of the power ": Industrial Equity Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 46 ; (1990) 170 CLR 649 at 672 per Gaudron J. A person challenging an exercise of power upon the basis of improper purpose has the onus of establishing that contention. Where the purpose of a decision must be ascertained by inference from other facts, there is a presumption of regularity: Haneef v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1273 at [278] , [2007] FCA 1273 ; 161 FCR 40 at 88 per Spender J. An appeal has been dismissed: Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Haneef [2007] FCAFC 203 , 163 FCR 414. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1748">8 The third basis raised by the appellant relates to the case of Haneef v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1273. The appellant asserts that her case is very similar to that in Haneef , despite the fact that the matters are in relation to two different sections of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and two entirely different decisions under review. The appellant submits that because I am related to the Solicitor General of the Commonwealth, who argued the Haneef case for the Commonwealth, I am somehow precluded from sitting on her case.
