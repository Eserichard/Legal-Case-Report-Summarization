<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 339">It was necessary for Jessup J to decide the point in ACOHS Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 577. His Honour (at [49] --- [50]) clearly regarded a rule which would deny the exercise of a discretion as to whether, on proof of a failure to fulfil, as an "oddity" but nonetheless held that the language of the sub-rule was such that, upon the requisite proofs, the Court was obliged to make an order. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 956">Ucorp claims the sum of $29,219.12, as having been paid by it to its Indian contractor, Elogix Software Private Ltd ("Elogix"), for work done by that company at the direction of Ucorp to ensure that Ucorp complied with the undertakings and order. In my reasons dated 3 June 2009, I explained, broadly, the role of Elogix in Ucorp's operations: see Acohs Pty Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 577 at [33] . Relevantly for present purposes, it is sufficient to note that it was Elogix's staff who undertook the function of sourcing, obtaining and registering MSDSs which had been published by others on the Internet. Here it is important to note that the second undertaking, and the order which replaced it, prohibited Ucorp from copying into the Collection any HTML source code relating to an Infosafe MSDS. Ucorp was, however, permitted to print and to scan an MSDS in HTML format, and to copy, reproduce or adapt an MSDS obtained in a format other than HTML. On the present application, the applicant emphasised that, unless an MSDS had been obtained in HTML format, the undertaking and order imposed no restraint upon Ucorp in relation to it. The applicant led evidence from which I would conclude on the probabilities that at least a very substantial number (indeed, as the applicant submitted, probably most) of the MSDSs obtained by Elogix were in PDF format. </sentence>
