<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1292">To some extent the applicant in the proceeding before me discloses it is not ready for a trial in December because it is a small firm that has been engaged in the conduct of the appeal against the representative proceeding decision and in the mediation of the dispute between Allphones and the franchisees, which was the subject of further proceeding before McKerracher J recently: see Weimann v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 1230. However, the parties to these proceedings have understood right through the year since the matter first came before me, that all parties are entitled to the earliest possible determination of the important commercial issues raised here. The matter is now clouded, however, by the ACCC proceedings against Allphones in Sydney. This is a new factor that must be considered. </sentence>
