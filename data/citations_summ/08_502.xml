<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1550">I otherwise agree with and adopt the Minister's submissions from paragraph 9 through to paragraph 21 of those submissions: In relation to Ground 1, this appears to be a complaint about the merits of the Tribunal's decision, which is not a proper ground of review in this Court. In relation to Ground 2, that is also a complaint about the merits of the Tribunal's decision: see SZIBR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 502 (21 April 2008); SZCQT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 822. Jurisdictional error does not encompass questions that may ultimately prove to be irrelevant to the disposition of an applicant's claims: SZGZL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 1509. The Tribunal was entitled to ask such questions of the applicants at the hearing before it as allowed it to test the applicants' claims: SZKUL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 791 at [28] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1263">14 This Ground should be rejected. It was (most probably) not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court and no reason has been exposed as to why it should now be entertained. In those circumstances where this Court has a discretion to permit a new ground to be raised on appeal, there should generally be an adequate explanation for not raising the ground before the Federal Magistrates Court ( SZIBR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 502 at [38] ---[41]) and leave should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so ( VUAX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] ---[48]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 778">25 Assuming that the written submissions constituted a previously unexpressed application for leave to amend the Notice of Appeal , the granting of such leave was opposed by the solicitor appearing for the Respondent Minister. Two principal contentions advanced on behalf of the Minister were that:
 
(a) none of the grounds had been advanced before the Federal Magistrates Court; and 
 
(b) none of the grounds were formulated in such a manner as to be able to be properly understood. Further, and more specifically, submissions focussed upon the fact that s 91R initially had been raised as a ground before the Federal Magistrates Court and an alternative ground expressly " substituted " in lieu. A party, of course, is generally not entitled to raise new grounds which were deliberately or by inadvertence not put to the court from which an appeal is brought: SZIBR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 502 at [38] per Lander J. The contention that there was a failure to " assess information " is simply denied by the very task undertaken by the Tribunal. That, and other grounds, it was submitted were thus without substance, nor was there any specification as to which of the " findings " of the Tribunal were said to have been made without sufficient evidentiary foundation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 735">46 So understood, objection was taken on behalf of the Respondent Minister. Leave to amend requires an adequate explanation to be provided as to why the new ground was not previously relied upon before the Federal Magistrate and may only be granted if the new ground has some merit: VUAX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] ---[48]; SZIBR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 502 at [38] ---[41]; SZLBJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 609. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 707">12 It should further be noted that this ground was not a ground raised for resolution before the Federal Magistrate. No satisfactory explanation has been provided for not previously raising it. Although this Court has a discretion to permit a new ground to be raised on appeal, there should generally be an adequate explanation for not raising the ground before the Federal Magistrate ( SZIBR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 502 at [38] ---[41]) and leave should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so ( VUAX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] ---[48]). In the present proceedings, the only explanation provided yesterday was that this particular ground was inserted consequent upon a meeting between the Appellant and a migration agent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 609">11 Appellants, whether represented or unrepresented, should be required to articulate before the Federal Magistrates Court their challenges to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. They should only be permitted to raise before this Court a new ground if there is an adequate explanation for not having raised the ground before the Federal Magistrate and if the ground has merit. In SZIBR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 502 Lander J summarised the position as follows:
 [38] A party is not entitled to raise new grounds which were deliberately or by inadvertence not put to the Court from which the appeal is brought: Metwally v University of Wollongong [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68 at 71. [39] If the appellant were entitled to raise these new grounds, it would mean that this Court would have to sit, as it were, as the Court at first instance to determine whether these new grounds would give rise to the relief sought in the application before the Federal Magistrate. Parliament has given the responsibility for hearing these applications exclusively to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
