<citphrase id="cp0.0" type=cited from="[2007] FCA 31">first , in the present case, the claimants must prove what indigenous laws and customs were being acknowledged and observed in the goldfields at the date of sovereignty</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp0.1" type=cited from="[2007] FCA 31">1829. but the first explorer did not reach any part of the wongatha claim area until 1869, and, in substance, european settlement did not occur there until the gold rush in the 1890s. in other words, the first substantial written records we have of aboriginal people anywhere in the wongatha claim area relate to the last decade of the nineteenth century, yet the claimants bear the onus of proving what the position was there in 1829. by contrast, in a case relating to an area where settlement of a colony first occurred, there will be written records relating to aboriginal laws and customs as they existed at sovereignty.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1459">In Lawson , Stone J dismissed an application for compensation in circumstances where there was no reasonable prospect of evidence being adduced to advance the claim. Justice Kiefel took a similar approach in Beattie on behalf of Western Wakka Wakka Peoples v Queensland [2007] FCA 596 at [23] . Her Honour referred to a lack of response to the orders of the Court and the lack of any purpose served by the continuation of the proceeding. </sentence>
