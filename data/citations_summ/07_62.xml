<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 379">The first respondent submits that: the applicant has advanced no real arguable grounds in the application; the first and second review grounds appear to take issue with the fact that the Tribunal had reference to the information provided by the applicant herself, which must have been relevant information and which is not indicative of jurisdictional error; it is for an applicant to advance whatever evidence or argument she wished to advance in support of her contention that she had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason and for the Tribunal to then determine if the applicant's claim has been made out; [36] the Tribunal is required to refuse the application for a protection visa in circumstances where the Tribunal is not affirmatively satisfied that the facts required to be established to satisfy the criteria for the grant of the protection visa have been established; [37] the third ground of review is baseless. The applicant was provided with an opportunity to comment upon the information but failed to take that opportunity. The applicant cannot complain if her application was rejected because amongst other reasons she failed to take up the opportunity to appear before the Tribunal and address any concerns it may have had about her claims; [38] the Tribunal fully considered all of the applicant's claims and based its decision on the information available. The applicant did not take up the opportunity to elaborate on her claims in person before the Tribunal. The Tribunal was therefore entitled to come to the conclusions it reached. The Tribunal's failure to be satisfied that the facts required to be established to satisfy the criteria for the grant of the protection visa had been established because of a lack of detailed information does not amount to a jurisdictional error; nothing indicates that the Tribunal failed to accord the applicant procedural fairness or failed to carry out a review in accordance with Division 4 Part 7 of the Migration Act ; the Tribunal Hearing Invitation was sent by registered post to the Castlereagh Street Sydney Address nominated by the applicant on her application for review of the Delegate's Decision. The applicant also failed to provide a telephone or facsimile number. While the applicant's residential address (the Dora Street Hurstville Address) is different, she clearly indicated on the review form that she wished all correspondence to go to the Castlereagh Street Sydney Address; the Tribunal sent the Tribunal Hearing Invitation to the applicant in accordance with ss.425 and 425A of the Migration Act , using a prescribed method in s.441A of the Migration Act ; [39] the applicant was also given more than the prescribed period of 14 days' notice of the Tribunal Hearing [40] and accordingly the requirements of s.425A(3) of the Migration Act were met. Consideration 
 Review ground 1
  It was for the applicant before the Tribunal at the Tribunal Hearing to affirmatively satisfy the Tribunal of the facts which had to be established to satisfy the criteria for the grant of a protection visa. [41] The inability of the Tribunal to reach a state of affirmative satisfaction as to whether or not the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution or a real chance of suffering persecution in the future was a consequence of the failure of the applicant: to provide any detailed information in the Protection Visa Application; and to attend the Tribunal Hearing of which she is deemed to have had proper notice. The failure to attend a hearing before the Tribunal to take up the opportunity to persuade the Tribunal to the requisite state of satisfaction will almost inevitably result in the application being dismissed.

There are many cases on this; SZGZQ v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 62 [13-14] per Greenwood J; Minister for Immigration v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 per Black CJ, Sundberg and Bennett JJ at [17]; SZIFB v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1727 per Jacobson J at [10] but perhaps the most lucid expression was given by Allsop J in NAST v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCA 86 at [6 - 7]: "My task in an application such as this is to ensure that the Tribunal has approached the matter lawfully so that it can be assessed one way or the other whether the claims of the applicants have been lawfully and properly considered. What it is necessary to understand is that the Tribunal is given the task of coming to a state of satisfaction. It either is satisfied of all relevant matters or it is not satisfied of all relevant matters. The most important consideration for it, and the one relevant here, was whether it was satisfied that the applicants had a well-founded fear of persecution under the Refugee Convention .

The tribunal has correctly approached its task by determining that if it is unable to be satisfied of those matters, the tribunal must "refuse to grant the visa.

<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FMCA 1516">The authorities make it clear that the obligation on the Tribunal is for it to be satisfied.
