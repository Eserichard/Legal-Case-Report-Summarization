 A fifth principle is that where there is a real issue of fact relevant to a pleaded cause of action, it is unlikely that that part of the proceeding has no prospect of success: see Boston Commercial Services at [44]. So, for example, if the pleadings, affidavits, and other materials considered in connection with the summary judgment motion, reveal a factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether or not the claim succeeds, it cannot be said that the claim has 'no reasonable prospect of success': see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] (stating that summary judgment should be made by reference to the pleadings, affidavits, and other evidence as appropriate under the circumstances) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 1416 at [32] .

The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings; (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial; (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial.

 Section 31A of the Act 
 
 Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] . Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: 
 
 
 (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings;
 (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; 
 (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading;

That is, the Court must assess the pleadings as if the facts alleged are true: see ACCC v Alice Car &amp; Truck Rentals Pty Ltd (unreported, O'Loughlin J, 5 March 1997).

<sentence id="cs26" from="[2008] FMCA 947">Therefore, to the extent that previous decisions of the Federal Court may be understood as suggesting that s 31A confers a general discretion (eg Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ), such a construction of the statutory language is rejected. [130] A fifth principle is that where there is a real issue of fact relevant to a pleaded cause of action, it is unlikely that that part of the proceeding has no prospect of success: see Boston Commercial Services at [44]. So, for example, if the pleadings, affidavits, and other materials considered in connection with the summary judgment motion, reveal a factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether or not the claim succeeds, it cannot be said that the claim has "no reasonable prospect of success": see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] (stating that summary judgment should be made by reference to the pleadings, affidavits, and other evidence as appropriate under the circumstances) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 1416 at [32] . On the other hand, if the factual contest is unnecessary to the resolution of the cause of action pleaded, then in the absence of other relevant material, there is nothing to prevent the court entering judgment on that claim. [131] By contrast, the existence of a real issue of law does not necessarily preclude summary judgment. A comprehensive review of the relevant authorities was undertaken by Driver FM in Vivid Entertainment LLC &amp; Ors v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FMCA 157.

A real issue of law does not necessarily preclude summary judgment; and In determining whether a real issue of fact exists such as to preclude summary judgment, the Court must draw all reasonable inferences --- but only reasonable inferences --- in favour of the non-moving party.

 "I emphasise "reasonable" because it is on this point that the lowering of the bar affected by s.31A becomes clear.

A fifth principle is that where there is a real issue of fact relevant to a pleaded cause of action, it is unlikely that that part of the proceeding has no prospect of success: see Boston Commercial Services at [44]. So, for example, if the pleadings, affidavits, and other materials considered in connection with the summary judgment motion, reveal a factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether or not the claim succeeds, it cannot be said that the claim has "no reasonable prospect of success": see Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [20] (stating that summary judgment should be made by reference to the pleadings, affidavits, and other evidence as appropriate under the circumstances) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 1416 at [32] . On the other hand, if the factual contest is unnecessary to the resolution of the cause of action pleaded, then in the absence of other relevant material, there is nothing to prevent the court entering judgment on that claim. 131. Even under the earlier, different and more stringent test, "argument, perhaps even of an extensive kind" was permitted "to demonstrate that the case of [a party] is so clearly untenable that it cannot possible succeed": General Steel Industries at 130. Once the court resolves the issue or issues of law, it will then be clear whether the opposing party has reasonable prospects of success and summary judgment can be granted or refused accordingly. 132 I now come to a final, sixth principle, which is that in determining whether a real issue of fact exists such as to preclude summary judgment, the court must draw all reasonable inferences - but only reasonable inferences - in favour of the non-moving party: Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 1416 at [30] ; Boston Commercial Services at [45].

By distinguishing between "hopeless" cases and those without reasonable prospects for success, the statute makes clear that the court need not (indeed, must not) refuse summary judgment on the basis of a factual dispute said to arise only from a plausible, as opposed to a reasonable, inference. The question of the precise meaning of s 31A of the FCA Act and s 17A of the FM Act and of any change they have made has already been the subject of numerous decisions in this Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. The most recent review of them of which I am aware is that of Driver FM on 19 March 2007 in Vivid Entertainment LLC v Digital Sinema Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 157 at [18] - [28]. The authorities to which his Honour referred are: Howard v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2006] FMCA 975 ; MG Distribution Pty Ltd v Khan [2006] FMCA 666 ; Cate v International Flavours and Fragrances (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 36 ; Vans Inc v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 ; Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 701 IPR 146 ; Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 ; Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227 ; Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; (2006) 150 IR 471 ; Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 1441 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 ; Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 ; Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299. Not one of these cases was a migration case. In other words, the task of exploring the meaning of s 31A has arisen in a wide range of the cases in the Federal Magistrates Court and this Court, with the striking exception of migration cases, no doubt for the reason that I mentioned earlier: the provision is of no practical importance in them.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2008] FCA 955">6 Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: 
 
 
 (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings;
 
 (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; 
 
 (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; 
 
 (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial;
 
 (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; 
 
 (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt.

<sentence id="cs35" from="[2008] FCA 37">12 The Commissioner submits that the application is misconceived. In order to succeed the Court must be satisfied that the Commissioner has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding (s 31A(1)(b) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)), although a defence need not be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success (s 31A(3)). It is clear enough that s 31A is wider than the previous regime for summary judgment had become. Counsel cited a number of decisions that have discussed this provision --- the latest being Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1416 at [30] per Jacobson J and Hicks v Ruddock (2007) 156 FCR 574 at [13] per Tamberlin J.

The authorities to which his Honour referred are: Howard v Australian Fisheries Management Authority [2006] FMCA 975 ; MG Distribution Pty Ltd v Khan [2006] FMCA 666 ; Cate v International Flavours and Fragrances (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 36 ; Vans Inc v Offprice.Com.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 137 ; Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 ; Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 ; Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227 ; Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; (2006) 150 IR 471 ; Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 1441 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 ; Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 ; Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299. Not one of these cases was a migration case. In other words, the task of exploring the meaning of s.31A has arisen in a wide range of the cases in the Federal Magistrates Court and this Court, with the striking exception of migration cases, no doubt for the reason that I mentioned earlier: the provision is of no practical importance in them.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs38" from="[2007] FCA 1308">11 Mr Walsh argued that in applying the test for entering judgment as he did under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) his Honour erred. He said that his Honour should have found that there would be reasonable prospects of Mr Walsh's claim succeeding if there were evidence which might reasonably be believed so as to enable him to succeed at the final hearing. This is a paraphrase made by Jacobson J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 at [30] of the ratio decidendi of my decision in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at 153-157 [31] - [45] . The principle which is involved in this respect is one that identifies whether there was evidence upon which a trial judge could reasonably find for a plaintiff (or defendant if it is the defendant who is resisting the summary decision). Unless that evidence is so negligible in character as to amount only to a scintilla, a judge should not direct a jury or himself or herself to find a verdict for the other side. Once evidence could have an ambivalent character, prior to final determination at a trial, then as a matter of law there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s 31A: Boston 70 IPR at 156-157 [43]. </sentence>

There will be reasonable prospects of success if there is evidence which may be reasonably believed so as to enable the party against whom summary judgment is sought to succeed at the final hearing. Evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects.

 BLEBY J: 
 
 Introduction 
 
 By his Will, William Wigham McGregor bequeathed, so far as is material, a one half interest in his residuary estate to his wife, Joan McGregor, for her life or until her remarriage, with remainder over such of his children as were living at the time of his death in equal shares. There were two sons who qualified, one of whom was James Alistair McGregor ("McGregor").</sentence>
