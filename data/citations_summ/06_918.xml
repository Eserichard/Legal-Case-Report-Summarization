12 The judgments tendered by the Crown, and objected to by the Accused, are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 (a) Harris v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCAFC 226 ;
 
 (b) Prebble v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCAFC 165 ;
 
 (c) Kajewski v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 258 ;
 
 (d) Cameron Brae Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 918. 
 
 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 16">Merkel J simply expressed his view that he was not satisfied that Essenbourne and Walstern were clearly wrong and accordingly proposed to follow them (at [121]). Kenny J made no finding, instead her Honour applied Essenbourne , on the assumption that it correctly stated the law on the point: See [57] --- [62]. 15 Following her Honour's judgment below, in Cameron Brae Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2006) FCA 918 ; 2006 ATC 4433 another judge of this Court (Ryan J) embraced the views of Kiefel J in Essenbourne and Hill J in Walstern (at [67] --- [74]). 16 The primary judge canvassed the construction adopted in the cases of Essenbourne and Walstern , and followed in Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions , at some length, and there is no utility in repeating those observations. THE COMMISSIONER'S SUBMISSIONS ON APPEAL 
 
17 On his appeal to this Court, the Commissioner made a number of submissions, some of which coincide with the reasons for his answer to question 1 in the ruling application, which reasons are set out in [12] above, others of which do not. The appellant, having acknowledged that the law was at the time as set out in Essenbourne Pty Ltd v. FCT , was bound by the terms of ss 14ZAF and 14ZAL of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to express his opinion in the private ruling only on how that law applied in relation to the arrangement. 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. As a result, even if this Full Court now decides the law differently from that decided in Essenbourne Pty Ltd v FCT and the other cases referred to in para 4 of the Notice of Appeal (and now also Cameron Brae Pty Ltd v C of T [2006] FCA 918) , the appellant, in expressly disregarding the authorities then binding him, wrongly denied to the respondent its right to receive the appellant's opinion on how that law applied to the arrangement. As a result, the private ruling should be corrected in accordance with the law that was then binding on the appellant. ' 
 
 
 

42 Having regard to my conclusion on the primary issue, it is not necessary that I address the issues raised by these contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] AATA 976">80. It was accepted by the respondent that on the present state of the law that binds the Tribunal [15] the definition of fringe benefit in s 136(1) of the FBT Act requires a particular employee to be identified in relation to the provision of the benefit. And the respondent also accepts that the present state of the law that binds us [16] is that s 67 of that Act, the anti --- avoidance provision, operates similarly.</sentence>
