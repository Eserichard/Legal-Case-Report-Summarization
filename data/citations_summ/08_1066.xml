<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 697">Mr White referred the Court to the decision in Samootin v Wagner , a judgment of Flick J dealing with the application of s.153B. [3] He submitted that the Court must first consider whether a sequestration order ought not to have been made and then, if it is so finds, whether in the exercise of its discretion the bankruptcy should be annulled. The relevant time at which such an assessment is to be made is the time when the sequestration order is made although the Court may take into account later evidence of previously unknown facts.  A person who seeks an annulment carries what O'Loughlin J described in Re Papps; Ex parte Tapp as a "heavy burden" . [7] On the material before me, including those matters about which Burchardt FM had no knowledge at the time of making his decision, but excluding events such as the sale of the Campbellfield property, which have occurred since, I am not satisfied that the Applicant has established that the Registrar was bound not to make the Sequestration Order and Burchardt FM was bound not to affirm that decision. I note in this regard that Flick J, in Samootin v Wagner , quoted the judgment of Fisher J in Re Franke; Ex parte Piliszky [8] who concluded, where in considering the wording of the predecessor provision to s.153B: In my opinion it can be said that a judge "ought" not to have made an order only if he was "bound" not to make the order. In circumstances where it was open to a judge to make an order in the exercise of his discretion, it can only be said he "ought not to have made the order" if none of the circumstances could justify the making of an order. [9] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 113">On 31 May 2006 a stay of the sequestration order was refused by Stone J ( Samootin v Wagner [2006] FCA 689). On 19 October 2007 Jacobson J rejected a challenge to the conduct of the first respondent which alleged that it had unlawfully caused a serious loss in the value of property in which the appellant had an interest before her estate was sequestrated ( Samootin v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2007] FCA 1618). 5 In the judgment which was the subject of the appeal to the Full Court last year ( Samootin v Wagner [2008] FCA 1066) Flick J referred at [19] to the sequestration order made against the estate of Ms Samootin on 24 May 2006 ( Wagner &amp; Anor v Samootin [2006] FMCA 688). Flick J went on to note at [20] --- [21]:
 
 
 20 An application to stay the sequestration order has been dismissed by a judge of this Court: Samootin v Wagner [2006] FCA 689. An appeal against the making of the sequestration order has also been dismissed: Samootin v Wagner [2006] FCA 945.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 587">The Applicant seeks leave to appeal from the decisions now made. That leave is granted and stood over for hearing before the Judge of this Court to whom the proceeding has been or will be docketed. That Judge can give such directions as is seen fit in relation to the hearing of that application for leave. Leave to appeal is granted to avoid any argument that the views previously expressed in Samootin v Wagner [2008] FCA 1066 may provide a basis for Ms Samootin to believe that the Motions now before the Court have not been properly addressed on such merits that they now present.  An application was also made by Ms Samootin that I disqualify myself, should I see fit to do so. That application was presumably based upon the views previously expressed in Samootin v Wagner [2008] FCA 1066. An appeal from that decision was dismissed: Samootin v Wagner [2009] FCAFC 77. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCAFC 77">1 This is an appeal from a judge of this Court dismissing the appellant's application for an annulment of bankruptcy ( Samootin v Wagner [2008] FCA 1066). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 601">The section has essentially two elements, namely the establishment of the state of satisfaction that a sequestration order ought not to have been made and, if that state of satisfaction is reached, thereafter an exercise of discretion: Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 at [59] , [2006] FCAFC 179 ; 155 FCR 531 at 543 per French J. Those who seek an annulment carry a " heavy burden ": Re Papps; Ex parte Tapp (1997) 78 FCR 524 at 531 per O'Loughlin J; Evans v Hi-Fert Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 802 at [11] ; Samootin v Wagner [2008] FCA 1066 at [32] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1718">11 That operation of s 153B was confirmed by Flick J in this Court in Samootin v Wagner [2008] FCA 1066 at [32] and [33]. His Honour applied what had fallen from Carr, Finn and Sundberg JJ in Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2003] FCAFC 315 at [20] :
 The Court must first consider whether the sequestration order ought not to have been made. If it so finds, then the Court must consider whether, in the exercise of its discretion, the bankruptcy should be annulled: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not to have been made. That is, the Court is entitled to consider not only the case as disclosed at the time when the sequestration order was made, but also those facts now known then to have existed. The Court excludes those facts which have occurred since the order was made. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not have been made: Re Frank; Ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396 ; Stankiewicz v Plata [2000] FCA 1185 at [19] ; Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 23; Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCA 347. These authorities, all of which were cited by the learned primary judge in his judgment, were accepted at first instance as reflecting the relevant law. </sentence>
