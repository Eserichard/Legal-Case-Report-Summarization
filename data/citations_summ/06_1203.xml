<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 224">In Re Investa Properties Limited [2007] FCA 1104 Lindgren J approved a no encumbrance provision qualified, as is the case here, by the phrase "to the extent permitted by law". His Honour discussed, at [25]-[28] the limits of such a clause and, in a statement with which I respectfully agree, concluded at [30]: 
 
 I regarded the opening words "To the extent permitted by law" as giving adequate notice that a third party would not suffer the extinguishment of an interest in shares if Morgan Stanley Bidco had had notice of that interest. I therefore took the view that those words overcame the difficulty referred to in WebCentral [2006] FCA 1203 ; 58 ACSR 742 , which was that the presence of a vesting free of encumbrances term might give the impression to third parties that their interests had been extinguished by the presence of the term where they would not have been in its absence.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1588">A similarly worded clause was considered by Lindgren J in Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1186. His Honour referred at [22] of his reasons to a "vesting free of encumbrances" term that he had considered in WebCentral Group Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 1203 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 742 and to his concerns that third parties having interests in the shares might be given the impression that their interests were being adversely affected. The relevant clause in WebCentral did not contain the qualification emphasised in the above quotation of cl 8.3(b). This qualification did appear in the "vesting free of encumbrances" term his Honour considered in Investa . In approving the clause containing the qualification his Honour made the following comments at [28] and [30] of his reasons: 
 
 Apparently the purpose of a vesting free of encumbrances term is only to make clear, as is the position under general law principles, that the acquiring company takes the shares free of equitable interests of which it was unaware. ... I regarded the opening words "To the extent permitted by law" as giving adequate notice that a third party would not suffer the extinguishment of an interest in shares if [the transferee] had had notice of that interest. I therefore took the view that those words overcame the difficulty referred to in WebCentral [2006] FCA 1203 ; 58 ACSR 742 , which was that the presence of a vesting free of encumbrances term might give the impression to third parties that their interests had been extinguished by the presence of the term where they would not have been in its absence.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 484">The third matter is the presence in the scheme of a "no incumbrances" provision. Provisions of this kind have been the subject of a number of decisions, stemming from Lindgren J's decision in Re WebCentral Group Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1203 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 742 ( WebCentral ). I followed WebCentral in the cases of Re Metals Exploration Limited [2007] FCA 84 and Re Uranium King Limited (No 3) [2008] FCA 1196 ; (2008) 67 ACSR 513. The concern in relation to the "no incumbrances" clauses, the subject of those decisions, was that third party interests might be affected by the presence of such a clause. However, in the case of Re Investa Properties Limited [2007] FCA 1104 ( Investa Properties ), Lindgren J considered whether the inclusion of the words "to the extent permitted by law" at the commencement of the "no incumbrances" clause would be sufficient to overcome the potential difficulties for third parties. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1196">16 The second issue relates to cl 3.5 of the Scheme. It comprises what is referred to as a "no encumbrance" clause. In Re Metals Exploration Ltd [2007] FCA 84 at [6] - [8], I followed the decision of Lindgren J in Re WebCentral Group Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1203 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 742 and approved the scheme of arrangement in that case subject to the deletion of the "no encumbrance" clause. In accordance with the reasoning in that case, I approve the Scheme subject to the deletion of cl 3.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1389">
 
 

9 In purporting to create a contractual obligation by the former member in favour of a third party --- whether the member voted for or against the scheme or did not vote --- that clause appears to stretch the effect of an arrangement between a company and its members a long way. However, Lindgren J considered such a clause in Re APN News 62 ACSR 400 ; 25 ACLC 784 ; [2007] FCA 770 at [57] ---[63] with approval and took the same course in Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 at [21] . In Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] QSC 207 Fryberg J considered such a clause at [20]---[29]. His Honour was persuaded to change the initial adverse reaction which he had expressed in Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd (2007) 61 ACSR 266 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 163 ; [2007] QSC 37 at [39] . In this field, it is acknowledged that uniformity of decision is important to avoid unnecessary uncertainty. As I cannot be satisfied that the other decisions are clearly wrong, I should follow them. If, on confirmation of the scheme, a party raises the issue so that an argument with a contradictor takes place, it is possible that a different result would occur. Even if that were so, the scheme could be confirmed without the relevant clause (cf Re WebCentral Group Ltd (No 2) (2006) 58 ACSR 742 ; [2006] FCA 1203). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 1104">25 The effect of the Court's approval of a scheme agreed to by the requisite majorities in number and in value is that the scheme is binding on all members and on the company: s 411(4). As noted in WebCentral [2006] FCA 1203 ; 58 ACSR 742 at [18] , in substance the effect is to supply consent to be bound by the scheme, even of members who did not vote in favour of it. The vesting free of encumbrances term would be binding on all members. It would, however, leave the interests of third parties to be governed by general law principles. As noted below, those principles give very substantial protection to an acquiring company. 22 As distinct from the deemed warranty just mentioned, the Scheme also includes (in cl 7.3(b)) what may be called a "vesting free of encumbrances" term. I discussed such a term in WebCentral Group Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 1203 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 742 ( WebCentral ) at [14]---[24], and will not repeat here what I said there. 29 The vesting free of encumbrances term expressed in cl 7.3(b) of the Share Scheme incorporates a qualification in the light of the observations in WebCentral [2006] FCA 1203 ; 58 ACSR 742. The term is as follows:
 
 To the extent permitted by law , all Investa Shares (including any rights and entitlements attaching to those shares) which are transferred to Morgan Stanley Bidco under this Investa Share Scheme will, at the date of the transfer of them to Morgan Stanley Bidco, vest in Morgan Stanley Bidco free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise, and free from any restrictions on transfer of any kind not referred to in this Investa Share Scheme. (Emphasis added. ) 

30 I regarded the opening words "To the extent permitted by law" as giving adequate notice that a third party would not suffer the extinguishment of an interest in shares if Morgan Stanley Bidco had had notice of that interest. I therefore took the view that those words overcame the difficulty referred to in WebCentral [2006] FCA 1203 ; 58 ACSR 742 , which was that the presence of a vesting free of encumbrances term might give the impression to third parties that their interests had been extinguished by the presence of the term where they would not have been in its absence.
  24 Could the presence of the term detrimentally affect the interests held by third parties in the shares the subject of the scheme? If not, why have, or not have, the term as part of the scheme (see WebCentral [2006] FCA 1203 ; 58 ACSR 742 at [20] )? If so, should the Court support a term that can detrimentally affect the interests of third parties who have not been heard?</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 770">

58 Clause 3.4 is not a "no encumbrances" provision of the kind considered in Re WebCentral Group Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1203 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 742 at [14] - [22] because it cannot give the impression to encumbrancees that their security over the shares is being adversely affected by the transfer. Indeed, it assumes that the shares may be transferred subject to encumbrances, to the detriment of INMAL.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 84">

5 This clause has been referred to as a 'no encumbrances' clause. In Re WebCentral Group Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1203 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 742 , Lindgren J approved a scheme of arrangement, on condition that the 'no encumbrances' clause, which was cl 9.3(b) of that scheme of arrangement, was deleted. Counsel for the plaintiff has submitted that WebCentral should not be followed, because the scheme of arrangement did not address itself to third parties who may have interests in the shares of the plaintiff; and the clause went no further than describing the position of third parties under the law, in any event.</sentence>
