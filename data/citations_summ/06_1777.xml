("tillmanns"), was a wholesale and retail butcher carrying on business in canberra and queanbeyan. the first-named respondent, the australasian meat industry employees' union ("the union") was an organization of employees including employees of wholesale and retail butchers and employees in abattoirs. the third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents were the president, secretary and two organizers of the union respectively. in december 1977 two of the respondents entered tillmannss' shop in queanbeyan and asked to see the employees. the request was refused by tillmanns' managing director because it was neither smoko nor lunchtime. the union retaliated by imposing a black ban upon tillmanns' shops. at that time canberra abattoir pty. ltd. ("canberra abattoir"), a company which conducted an abattoir in the australian capital territory, held for tillmanns thirty-two cattle awaiting slaughter and the carcasses of twenty head of cattle and seventeen pigs. as a result of the black ban by the union the live cattle were not slaughtered for some weeks and the carcasses were released to tillmanns only about a week later to avoid deterioration. the appellant instituted an action in the federal court of australia seeking an injunction and damages under ss. 80 and 82 in relation to s. 45d of the trade practices act 1974 ("the act ") alleging that the respondents acted in concert to prevent supplies of meat to tillmanns in breach of s. 45d of the act . the trial judge declined to find that the respondents' conduct had the relevant effect and refused to award damages or to grant an injunction. he stated in his judgment, inter alia, that the plaintiff (appellant) was not entitled to argue that the conduct complained of would be likely to cause substantial loss where the means of proving whether in fact it did cause substantial loss were in its power. the appellant appealed to the full court of the federal court of australia against this judgment claiming that an injunction should have been ordered.  held: per curiam</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 863">There is also an issue concerning whether the Court has to be as satisfied of the proof of primary facts as it does of the inferences to be drawn from those facts which will determine the outcome of the proceedings. The decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Transport Industries Insurance Co Ltd v Longmuir [1997] 1 VR 125 would suggest not. However, a different approach may have been taken in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v IMP Operation &amp; Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777 ; (2006) 157 FCR 162 where, after setting out the primary facts, Young J said: The ACCC's case is, to some extent at least, based on inferences from the facts to which I have already referred. In drawing inferences of fact of this kind, the civil standard of proof applies, but the facts and inferences upon which the ACCC relies must be proved to a level of satisfaction that is commensurate with the seriousness of the allegations. The allegations made against the CEPU are very serious and can give rise to substantial penalties. (at 195 [140]). 
His Honour then considered and proceeded to apply the principles enunciated by Dixon J in Briginshaw . An appeal from his Honour's decision was dismissed in CEPU v ACCC and the Full Court appears to have approved of his Honour's approach: at 482 [37]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 369">Given that the injunctions directed to Mr Kritas cover franchising activities beyond those associated with the Mailpost Business and given the other matters to which I have referred to at [33] above, it is appropriate that the injunctions be limited as to time. This was the approach taken by Young J in IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777 ; 157 FCR 162 at [233] ---[234] and by Stone J in Signature Security Group Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 375 ; [2003] ATPR 41-942 at [3] ---[4].  There is now a body of authority in this Court in which final injunctions limited as to time have been granted (see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Wizard Mortgage Corporation Ltd [2002] FCA 1317 ; [2002] ATPR 41-903 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Signature Security Group Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 375 ; [2003] ATPR 41-942 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v George Weston Foods Ltd [2004] FCA 1093 ; (2004) 210 ALR 486 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 683 ; [2005] ATPR 42-070 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777 ; (2006) 157 FCR 162 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 1546 ; [2007] ATPR 42-192 ; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1976 ; (2008) 253 ALR 89). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 88">The parties also propose that injunctions issue forbidding the respondents for a period of three years from engaging in like conduct. Once again, it is reasonable that this relief be granted. The period that the injunctions are to continue is not unreasonable: compare Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777 ; (2006) 157 FCR 162 at [233] - [234] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1976">Young J and Stone J have also had occasion to consider the question of time limits on injunctions granted on the Commission's application. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation &amp; Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777 ; (2006) 157 FCR 162 ( IPM ), the Commission sought a final injunction against the respondent Union. Young J unequivocally rejected (at [233]) a final injunction as "plainly inappropriate" and would "not contemplate an injunction that operates indefinitely" in a case where the relevant conduct had come to an end. His Honour observed that in such a case, any injunction should be for only a limited period of time, and noted that this course was commonly taken in the authorities. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 678">7 There are three distinct matters to which it is necessary to refer. The first relates to ss 45E and 45EA. The second, to accessorial liability and ss 76 and 75B of the TP Act. The third concerns the standard of proof in this matter and s 140(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). The applicable principles in relation to each of these are not in dispute in these proceedings. They have been the subject of recent judicial consideration, notably in Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 ("CEPU") and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777 ; (2006) 157 FCR 162.

I will not set out all of the authorities referred to by counsel. Particular reference is made to the decisions of Young J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) v IPM Operation &amp; Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777 ; (2006) 157 FCR 162 , the decision of Tracey J on a separate penalty matter in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) v IPM Operation &amp; Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 144 , (2007) ATPR 42-151 ; and of the Full Court in Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) [2007] FCAFC 132. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCAFC 132">7 The primary judge found that Edison and the CEPU had entered into a 'contract, arrangement or understanding' that required each electrical contractor engaged by Edison to have an enterprise bargaining agreement with the CEPU. He concluded that this amounted to a contravention of s 45E(3) by Edison, to which the CEPU was an accessory pursuant to s 76(1) of the Act. He held that this occurred in the week of 13 August 2001; that is prior to the making of the heads of agreement on 23 August 2001 ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Management Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777 ; (2006) 157 FCR 162). He based the finding of the earlier contract, arrangement or understanding on a memorandum of understanding which the CEPU had signed with Simon Engineering on 15 August 2001. However, the ACCC never pleaded or particularised such a case and neither party had referred at any time to the memorandum of understanding. The CEPU complains that his Honour denied it natural justice in the way in which he used the evidence of the memorandum of understanding made on 15 August 2001. Neither counsel had referred to that document in addresses nor was it referred to in any pleading or particulars. A principal question in the appeal is whether the primary judge was correct in that finding of an earlier contract, arrangement or understanding.</sentence>

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 144">2 The CEPU contested the allegations made against it. The proceeding, in so far as it involved allegations against the CEPU, went to trial before Young J. On 19 December 2006 his Honour made orders declaring that the CEPU had been an accessory to the contraventions, by Edison, of ss 45E(3) and 45EA of the Act. His Honour further ordered that the CEPU be restrained for a period of three years from engaging in any repetition of such conduct directed to Edison: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777. Having heard further submissions relating to the quantum of penalty and costs his Honour, on 16 January 2007, ordered that the CEPU pay a penalty of $125,000 and costs of $200,000: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCA 11. The CEPU has lodged an appeal against his Honour's decision. The appeal grounds challenge his Honour's findings in relation to liability and penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCA 11">2 On 19 December 2006, I delivered judgment in relation to the claims brought by the ACCC against the CEPU, except for the claims relating to penalty and costs: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1777. Amongst other relief, I said that I would grant the following declarations in relation to the CEPU's accessorial conduct: 
 
 '1. Prior to August 2001, the First Respondent was accustomed to acquire goods or services from certain Contractors, and in those circumstances, in August 2001, the Second Respondent: 
 (a) aided, abetted, counselled, procured and induced the First Respondent to make; and 
 (b) was knowingly concerned in and party to the First Respondent making, 
 a contract, arrangement or understanding with the Second Respondent which contained a provision that: 
 (c) the First Respondent would not engage a Contractor to perform work at the Loy Yang B power station in Victoria unless that Contractor had a current certified agreement with the Second Respondent; and 
 (d) was included in the contract, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of preventing or hindering the First Respondent from acquiring goods or services from Contractors who did not have a current certified agreement with the Second Respondent, 
 with the consequence that the First Respondent thereby contravened s 45E(3) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). 
 
 2. Prior to August 2001, the First Respondent was accustomed to acquire goods or services from certain Contractors, and in those circumstances, in August 2001, the Second Respondent counselled, procured and induced the First Respondent to give effect to the provision of the contract, arrangement or understanding with the Second Respondent referred to in paragraph 1 of these declarations, with the consequence that the First Respondent thereby contravened s 45EA of the Trade Practices Act . ' 


I also held that the ACCC was entitled to injunctive relief against the CEPU. </sentence>
