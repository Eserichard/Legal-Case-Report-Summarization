<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 417">In that case, Hood J said (at 494):
 "the reason underlying the numerous and varying cases in which appellants have been ordered to give security will be found in the injustice to a successful litigant that may be caused if he be compelled to contest the matter for a second time without a probability of obtaining his costs if ultimately successful. "
 That really is the fundamental question of justice behind my decision to order security for costs.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 509">16 The circumstances in which security for costs may be ordered are not confined to particular factors: Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation [1984] FCA 34 ; (1984) 2 FCR 1 , at 3-4. Although the current appeals have been instituted and are to be heard on 15 May 2007 by the Full Court, a single judge has power to order the provision of security for costs of an appeal: see per Hely J in Croker v Deputy Registrar of the High Court of Australia [2003] FCA 681 at [2] ; and per Marshall J in Upton v Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1336. </sentence>
