<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 38">The Minister argued that, first, neither he nor the Secretary had any duty to provide the Tribunal with the STARTTS report and, secondly, the Tribunal had performed its function of review of the delegate's decision without its decision being affected by jurisdictional error. There is an incongruity in these submissions. The Tribunal, for the purpose of the review, may exercise all the powers and discretions of the Minister and his delegate in respect of the appellant's application for a protection visa by force of s 415(1). Had the delegate not made the decision under review before the Minister received the STARTTS report, then he or she would have been obliged to consider it as material of which the Minister (and thus his delegate) had constructive, if not actual, notice. That is because a decision-maker must make his decision on the basis of the most current material available to him or her. As Mason J said in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 45; (cf: SZJTQ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1938 ; (2008) 172 FCR 563): 
 
 "It would be a strange result indeed to hold that the Minister is entitled to ignore material of which he has actual or constructive knowledge and which may have a direct bearing on the justice of making the land grant, and to proceed instead on the basis of material that may be incomplete, inaccurate or misleading. In one sense this conclusion may be seen as an application of the general principle that an administrative decision-maker is required to make his decision on the basis of material available to him at the time the decision is made. But that principle is itself a reflection of the fact that there may be found in the subject-matter, scope and purpose of nearly every statute conferring power to make an administrative decision an implication that the decision is to be made on the basis of the most current material available to the decision-maker. "

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 152">The next argument in the written submission has no substance. While the tribunal ordinarily should act on the latest information available to it ( Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 45 Mason J; SZJTQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1938 ; (2008) 172 FCR 563 at 573 [40] per myself), there is no evidence that it did not do so in this case. The third complaint in the written submissions is also without substance. The tribunal's decision record reveals that it did give the appellant a proper opportunity to explain his claims and address the tribunal's concerns about them relating to the accusation of his being involved with the terrorist group. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 837">When the declaration is made under s 269ZDB(1), the Minister must consider, or have regard to, the most up to date information available. The Act requires the Minister to form a judgment about the current circumstances and future consequences of the importation of the relevant goods. This is so for the following reasons. First, the review is intended to consider the impact of changed circumstances in a market affected by the operation of a notice under s 269TG(2) (whether in its original or a varied form) (s 269SM(5)). That requires consideration of the current circumstances that formed the basis for the review identified by ss 269ZA(1)(b) and 269ZC(2)(b), namely a change in a variable factor or the current absence of justification for the Minister to take any relevant anti-dumping measure. Secondly, it is a general principle that an administrative decision-maker is required to make his or her decision on the most current material available to the decision-maker: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 44-45 per Mason J (with whom Gibbs CJ at 30 and Dawson J at 71 agreed on this issue); SZJTQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1938 ; (2008) 172 FCR 563 at 571-572 [27] - [32] where I discussed this principle.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 399">The Minister's submissions also address a query raised by me at the first court date hearing in this matter on 3 February 2009. I queried whether the decision of his Honour Rares J in SZJTQ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1938 had any application to this case. The Minister answers that question in the negative on the basis that his Honour's decision bore on the position of a child and here there was no child involved. Hence, the Tribunal could not have fallen into the error identified by Rares J in relation to the claims of a child. Consideration

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 88">In its findings and reasons the Tribunal addressed the applicant's claim to fear persecution as a Coptic Christian. In so doing it had regard to the 2007 Report in the sense required under s.424. This is apparent from its references to the Report, its acceptance, consistent with the Report, that Coptic Christians were a minority religion in Egypt and, importantly, and consistent with parts of the Report referred to under this ground, that they were " often subject to some discrimination for reasons of religion . " It recognised that the 2007 Report gave a general overview of the current situation for Coptic Christians in Egypt. It was also open to the Tribunal and appropriate for it (see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Another v Peko-Wallsend Limited and Others (1986) 162 CLR 24 and SZJTQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1938) to refer to more recent independent country information about a court decision that took a different approach to decisions discussed in the 2007 Report and that was said to have been a victory for freedom of religion in considering whether there was tolerance of conversions or discrimination against Christians such as to constitute persecution. </sentence>
