<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1031">The applicant was dissatisfied with the replacement cuff links because, in his view, they exhibited the same defects as had been found to exist in the original set of cuff links purchased by him. These transactions between the applicant and the High Court spawned a plethora of litigation between the applicant and the respondent. A summary of that litigation up to late 2007 is found in the judgment of Cowdroy J in Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 452 at [2] ---[35]. That summary is amplified in [2] of the Written Submissions filed on behalf of the respondent in this proceeding on 10 August 2010. It is not necessary for present purposes to traverse in detail the prior litigation between the applicant and the respondent concerning the cuff links.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 942">80 In December 2007 the defendant sought to revive his initial application to the Federal Court (proceedings number NSD2478/06) which Stone J transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court (referred to above at [76]). The application relied upon the same facts as the first application but this time sought $200,000 in "compensatory, punitive, aggravated and exemplary damages" for "wrongfully defending a claim, breach of warranty, false or misleading representations and misleading and deceptive conduct". In April 2008 Cowdroy J struck out the application ( Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 452) , noting that:
 
 
 "[58]... the Court is mindful that the power to strike out proceedings should be used only in exceptional cases where the facts disclose a clear case of abuse... 
 


 
 
 [59] The current proceedings can be so categorised. They have been instituted solely for the purpose of circumventing the orders made in SYG 548 of 2007. An applicant is not entitled to commence fresh proceedings because orders are made in earlier proceedings with which that applicant disagrees. Such conduct obstructs the administration of justice and accordingly constitutes an abuse of process. 
 

...
 
 
 [61] Further, the Court is mindful of the frivolous nature of the claim and of the fact that the respondent has been put to expense out of all proportion to any damages that could realistically be awarded in Mr Croker's favour. Mr Croker has refused an open offer of settlement made at the conclusion of this hearing ... As Mr Croker has been unable to quantify any loss, the offer was clearly reasonable ... Although it is not necessary to do so, the Court considers that grounds exist for the proceedings to be dismissed ... as vexatious and frivolous..." </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 972">1 This is an application for leave to extend the time in which the applicant may file an application for leave to appeal against a decision of Cowdroy J. His Honour dismissed the proceedings before him as being an abuse of the process of the court and also found that they were frivolous and vexatious within O 20 r 5(1)(a) and (b): Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 452.  12 His Honour was also mindful of the frivolous nature of the claim and the fact that the Commonwealth had been put to expense out of all proportion to any damages that could be realistically awarded in Mr Croker's favour: C roker [2008] FCA 452 at [61] . Far from seeing any possible error or injustice in his Honour's reasoning, it appears to me to be entirely apposite and correct. 
  11 Cowdroy J found no basis for Mr Croker's assertion that the Commonwealth had acted otherwise than in accordance with the standards expected of it as a model litigant under the Legal Services Directions 2005 made pursuant to s 55ZF of the Judiciary Act . His Honour was mindful that the power to strike proceedings out or to dismiss them should only be used in exceptional cases where the facts disclosed a clear case of abuse. He found that the current proceedings before him had been instituted solely for the purpose of circumventing the orders made by Lloyd-Jones FM in the proceedings before the Federal Magistrates Court. His Honour concluded that ( Croker [2008] FCA 452 at [59] ):
 "An applicant is not entitled to commence fresh proceedings because orders are made in earlier proceedings with which that applicant disagrees. Such conduct obstructs the administration of justice and accordingly constitutes an abuse of process. "  9 The last reference was to the directions under s 55ZF of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) given by the Attorney General as to how litigation ought be conducted on behalf of the Commonwealth. Cowdroy J also asked Mr Croker how he quantified his claim for damages. He suggested that "opportunity costs would be won", identifying the opportunity in the following exchange which his Honour set out: Croker [2008] FCA 452 at [55] . "MR CROKER: Your Honour, I would have to go into more detail to give you --- I'd have to more time. HIS HONOUR: All right. I'm ready to hear that detail. MR CROKER: Your Honour, I wouldn't be able to do it straight away. I'd have to do some research and give you exactly what would be legally - - - HIS HONOUR: You mean to say at the moment you cannot quantify your loss. MR CROKER: Well, your Honour, I would estimate it as a nominal amount in damages or loss in the way that it is an amount which I think is reasonable for ---"  8 His Honour pointed out that Mr Croker had led no evidence to suggest he might be impecunious or otherwise unable to pay the amount of security for costs ordered by Lloyd-Jones FM. His Honour set out Mr Croker's explanation, as to why he had not proceeded in the Federal Magistrates Court, which he gave to Cowdroy J at the hearing of the application in which his Honour found the proceedings to be an abuse of process: see Croker [2008] FCA 452 at [54] . Mr Croker told Cowdroy J:
 "Your Honour, I found that there was a security for costs issue that was difficult for me to meet also the production of documents was being to be insisted which I thought were irrelevant relevant [sic] to the matter and I was really looking at the legal services directions, your Honour and my understanding is that they are enforceable under the Judiciary Act 1903 .
