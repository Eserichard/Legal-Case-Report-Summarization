<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1343">In considering the effect of these words, it is important to identify what it is that s 87(1A) requires the Court to consider appropriate. The wording of the section makes it clear that the question for the Court is whether it is appropriate to make an order in the terms of the agreement reached between the parties. Therefore the central focus of the section is that agreement: Lovett v Victoria [2007] FCA 474 (" Lovett ") at [37]; Nangkiriny v Western Australia (2002) 117 FCR 6 ; [2002] FCA 660 at [8] ; James v Western Australia [2002] FCA 1208 at [4] ; Ward v Western Australia [2006] FCA 1848 at [9] ; Cox v Western Australia [2007] FCA 588 at [12] ; Brown v Western Australia [2007] FCA 1025 at [23] ; Hughes v Western Australia [2007] FCA 365 at [9] ; Kogolo v Western Australia [2007] FCA 1703 at [18] and Eringa v South Australia [2008] FCA 1370 (" Eringa ") at [33]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1334">Numerous decisions of the Federal Court have emphasised that provisions such as s 87 and s 87A of the Native Title Act are designed to facilitate and encourage the resolution of native title claims by agreements between parties. They recognise that the Court adopts a different approach to the task of deciding whether it is appropriate to make a determination reached by agreement, than it brings to the task of deciding if native title should be recognised after a contested hearing. In each case, the definition of native title is the same. The Act requires the Court to set out details of the matters mentioned in s 225 of the Native Title Act in all determinations whether reached by agreement or following a hearing. These decisions make plain that, although there needs to be some foundation upon which the Court can exercise its jurisdiction, in matters in which the parties have reached agreement on the terms of a determination, the Court will have particular regard to whether the agreement has been freely entered into on an informed basis. See for example: Eringa, Eringa No 2, Wangkangurru/Yarluyandi and Irrwanyere Mt Dare Native Title Claim Groups v The State of South Australia [2008] FCA 1370 per Lander J at 33; Nangkiriny v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 660 ; (2002) 117 FCR 6 ; Ward v State of Western Australia [2006] FCA 1848 ; Lovett on behalf of the Gundtjmara People v State of Victoria [2007] FCA 474. If that question is answered in the affirmative, the Court will consider the fact that an agreement has been reached as weighing in favour of the making of the determination of native title: James on behalf of the Martu People v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 1208. It may even be that in some cases, the freely informed agreement will be a sufficient basis for the Court to make such consent orders: Ward v State of Western Australia , North J at [8]; Hughes (On behalf of the Eastern Guruma People) v Western Australia [2007] FCA 365 , Bennett J at [9]. </sentence>
