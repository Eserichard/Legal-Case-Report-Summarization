<citphrase id="cp14.12" type=cited from="[1981] FCA 31">crimes act 1914 (cth), s. 10. a warrant was issued pursuant to s. 10 of the crimes act 1914 . the warrant purported to authorize the respondent to enter the premises of the appellant solicitors and to seize any document which might afford evidence as to the commission of offences against s. 67 of the companies ordinance 1962 (a.c.t.). the appellants were not implicated in the offences alleged in the warrant. the respondent attended at the premises of the solicitors for the purpose of executing the warrant. he wanted "if necessary to go to any cupboard, safe or other place on the premises to obtain documents". the appellants refused to hand over some documents on the ground of legal professional privilege and issued a writ claiming a declaration to restrain the respondent "from pursuing . . . a threatened trespass against goods . . . in purported execution of a search warrant". the validity of the search warrant was not attacked and the only issue raised was the extent and nature of the search permitted under the warrant.  held: per curiam, dismissing the appeal</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp14.13" type=cited from="[1981] FCA 31">(1) neither legal professional privilege nor the contractual relationship existing between solicitor and client is relevant in relation to the nature and extent of the permissible search because where a statute provides for access to documents to be available to a person the fact that those documents are held by a solicitor and were entrusted to him by a client does not provide a ground for the solicitor to refuse access to the documents.  parry-jones v. law society, (1969) 1 ch 1 ; brayley v. wilton, (1976) 2 nswlr 495 , followed.  smorgon v. australia and new zealand banking group ltd.

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCAFC 183">13 Sundberg J heard the warrant proceeding on 1 and 2 June 2006. On 30 June 2006, his Honour delivered judgment, dismissing the application. His Honour stated (in Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 819 ; (2006) 230 ALR 254 ("the warrant judgment") at [13]) that three issues fell for determination:
 
 
 &#8226; the applicant's attack on the warrant on the same grounds as those dealt with by Young J in A2 v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 106 (the A2 point); 
 &#8226; his attack on the procedure by which the Commission obtained the notebook; and 
 &#8226; his attack on the procedure by which the Commission obtained the DVDs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] SADC 132">Neither of those two sections were triggered by the procedures adopted by Jones or Leske here. The relevant state of belief was already entertained by Leske, so there was no necessity for making any pre-seizure examination. At that time Leske already believed "there is ... evidential material at the premises" so that no occasion for exercising the option to proceed under s3K(2) actually arose. That would only come into play on the contingency under s3E(c) that she held the lesser belief "there will be within the next 72 hours ...". Once in force, s3F(1)(c) authorised her as "executing officer" to search the premises for the "evidential material" specified in the warrant and to "seize things of that kind found at those premises": A2 v Australian Crime Commission (2006) .
