<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 188">As the respondents have made out a case in favour of security, the question arises as to the form which the security should take. In my view, a guarantee provided by Mr and Mrs Calvert would be the most appropriate form of security as they are the persons in whose interest the proceeding is principally being bought. However, they are not parties to the proceeding and thus the Court cannot make an order requiring them to give security for the applicant: Instyle Contract Textiles Pty Ltd v Good Environmental Choice Services Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1422 ; (2009) 181 FCR 360. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] QCA 24">Mr Hackett who appears for the appellant, urged, by reference to Instyle Contract Textiles Pty Ltd v Good Environmental Choice Services Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1422 ; (2009) 262 ALR 445 and Memutu Pty Ltd v Lissenden (1983) 8 ACLR 364 , that it was sufficient to avoid the making of an order that the sole director and shareholder of the company, who happened to be a solicitor who could be understood to know the propriety of offering an undertaking had, in fact, offered the undertaking in the form that I've already described.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1151">Section 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act also confers a power on this Court to require an applicant in a proceeding to give security for the costs that may be awarded against it, him or her and to dismiss a proceeding in the event of non-compliance with the order. The power is not expressly constrained by the need to present credible testimony and is not limited to corporations. Moreover, as Lindgren J observed in Instyle Contract Textiles Pty Ltd v Good Environmental Choice Services Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1422, 181 FCR 360 at [6] there may be circumstances in which it is appropriate to order security although there is no question of an applicant's capacity to satisfy an adverse costs order, such as where the applicant has no assets within the jurisdiction, as his Honour did in Austin, Nichols and Co Inc v Lodestar Anstalt [2009] FCA 1228. But, as Perram J observed in Soul Pattinson Telecommunications Pty Ltd v Subex Americas Inc [2009] FCA 651 at [6] , where the only basis for seeking security is the applicant's asserted inability to pay the respondent's costs, it is difficult to see the practical difference between the two provisions. In the present case, no party argued there was and each was content to approach the matter on the basis that the requirements of s 1335 of the Corporations Act needed to be met. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 438">Unlike s 1335(1) of the Corporations Act , s 56 of the Federal Court Act does not require "credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the corporation will be unable to pay the costs of [the respondents]". The differences between the two provisions have been considered by decisions of this Court: see, for example, Instyle Contract Textiles Pty Ltd v Good Environmental Choice Services Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1422 ; (2009) 181 FCR 360 at [6] - [8]; MHG Plastic Industries Pty Ltd v Quality Assurance Services Pty Limited [2002] FCA 821 at [8] - [9]. However, given that the applicant's impecuniosity was the cornerstone of their motion, the respondents submitted that the Court's jurisdiction under both provisions was, in this case, relevantly identical. They proceeded on the basis that they were required to satisfy the threshold requirement of s 1335(1) in order to succeed on the motion. This approach is understandable. Where the only asserted basis for an order for security relates to the alleged inability of the applicant to meet a future costs order, it is difficult to see in practice a difference between the operation of the two provisions: see the observations of Perram J in Soul Pattinson Telecommunications Pty Ltd v Subex Americas Inc [2009] FCA 651 at [6] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] NSWCA 94">
 


 
32 Prynew did not adduce any evidence of Mr Tsu's financial position and did not submit that he was a person of substantial means, as was the case with Mr Roach in Winnote v Page . To the extent that there is evidence of Mr Tsu's financial position, it is either neutral or tends to indicate that he is not a person of substantial means, as I explain below. However, in this case, unlike the position in Winnote , Mr Tsu is not only a co-appellant, he has also offered to be responsible for the costs of the appeal should he and Prynew be unsuccessful. Prynew relied therefore, upon both Mr Tsu's status as a cross-appellant as well as his offer. In either case, it submitted that the financial situation of an individual, whether a co-plaintiff or person prepared to " step out " from behind the corporate entity and offer an undertaking in respect of any costs order, is irrelevant. This submission was centrally based upon the remarks of Basten JA in Jazabas v Haddad and the decision of Lindgren J in Instyle Contract Textiles Pty Limited v Good Environmental Choice Services Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1422 ; (2009) 181 FCR 360. </sentence>
