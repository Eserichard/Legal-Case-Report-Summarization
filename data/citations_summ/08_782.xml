 ORDERS
 
 (1) The Application is dismissed. (2) The Applicant is to pay the First Respondent's costs fixed in the sum of $4,500.00. The Applicant's Ground 1(e) claims that the Tribunal made incorrect findings about the Applicant's credibility based on a misunderstanding of the medical certificate that he submitted. This again is no more than an impermissible attempt to review the factual merits of the decision reached by the Tribunal and should be rejected. The task of making findings of fact, including findings as to credibility, is for the Tribunal alone ( Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [24] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 760">In the recent decision of SZLHA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [12] , an appeal from this court, Flick J succinctly sets the considerations relevant to impermissible attempts to review the factual merits of a decision reached by the Refugee Review Tribunal or the Migration Review Tribunal: A court conducting judicial review of an administrative decision must "beware of turning a review of the reasons of the decision-maker upon proper principles into a reconsideration of the merits of the decision": Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ.
