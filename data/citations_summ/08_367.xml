<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] MRTA 707">The Tribunal has before it a medical assessment dated 23 April 2008. However, the MOC opinion being considered by the Tribunal must address the applicant's satisfaction or lack of satisfaction of the requirement in 4007(1)(c) at the time of the Tribunal's decision: Applicant Y v MIAC [2008] FCA 367. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 517">Moreover, contrary to any contention of a lack of procedural fairness, the Tribunal agreed to the review applicant's request for a new medical assessment by an RMOC. It cannot be said that the Tribunal did not respond to this request. No issue arises as to whether the Tribunal took an outdated MOC opinion as correct (cf Applicant Y v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 367 ; (2008) 100 ALD 544). In addition, the Tribunal invited the review applicant to comment on the opinion of the RMOC in accordance with s.359A of the Migration Act , provided her with a copy of that opinion and took into account the response of her adviser. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 121">The applicants contend that the passing reference to the two integers made by the Finance Minister in his concluding observations is not adequate. Reliance is placed upon Applicant Y v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 367 ; (2008) 100 ALD 544 in which the Court found (at [32]) that the Migration Review Tribunal 'did not engage any assessment of' the weight or relevance of expert medical opinions. The applicants submit that the same conclusion should be drawn in the present circumstance because the Finance Minister indicated the matters of real concern and made no mention of the two integers. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 970">In connection with this submission, the applicant relied on the decision of Applicant Y v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 110 ALD 544 , [2008] FCA 367 , where it was held that the MOC opinion relied on by the Tribunal in relation to the waiver of the health criterion had to be a current opinion. In Applicant Y , the MOC's opinion was 
23 months old at the time of the Tribunal's decision. The court considered that the applicant's health or the treatments for her condition could have changed considerably in that time. </sentence>
