<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 225">The principle that an error must be material in order to provide a basis for relief is well established in relation to jurisdictional error, e.g., SZIGH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1885 at [41] --- [44], and statutory judicial review for error of law: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 353, 384. As to the ground of review invoked by ground 1 (that is, s 5(1)(d) of the AD(JR) Act), it may be argued that the Minister was deprived of any power to act (and hence the decisions under review were deprived of any legal basis) by the absence of a 'recommendation' made in accordance with s 269ZZK(1). However, the Commonwealth respondents submitted that the TMRO's recommendation was a recommendation of that kind, to the extent that it was supported by s 269ZZK(1)(b) --- that is, to the extent that it called for the reinvestigation of findings that had been 'specified' in the applications for review. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1063">Insofar as the applicant takes issue with the Tribunal's consideration of independent country information in relation to the situation in Bangladesh, the choice and weight to be attributed to items of country information are matters for the Tribunal (see SZIJG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1652). It is apparent that the Tribunal took into account the most recently available country information in relation to the situation in Bangladesh (see SZIGH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1885). This ground is not made out. Section 424 of the Migration Act 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1938">30 Recently, Buchanan J referred to the need for a decision maker to make his or her decision on the basis of the most current material available to him or her at the time the decision is made. He described this as an "expected practice", but in the circumstances of the matter he was deciding, he said that it was not necessary for him to consider the "expected practice ... as one in the nature of a jurisdictional imperative": SZIGH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1885 at [34] . This was because the tribunal had disbelieved the applicant for review in that case on matters completely unrelated to the more recent country information, which could not possibly have been relevant to events claimed to have occurred many years before. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1669">Moreover, even if the Tribunal erred in failing to identify and have regard to more recent independent country information, such an error will only be jurisdictional error if it affected the exercise of the Tribunal's power. To that end, the Applicant would need to satisfy the Court that the Tribunal's failure to have regard to more recent independent country information affected the exercise of its power in determining whether or not the Applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention-related reason ( Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 (" Craig ") at 179; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 (" Yusuf ") at [82] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed); SZIGH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1885 (" SZIGH ") per Buchanan J at [42], [43] and [44]). There is no evidence before this Court to support such a contention. As Buchanan J observed in SZIGH , the element of whether or not an error represents jurisdictional error because it affects the exercise of power " is not supplied by assumption or the identification of mere possibilities " (at [44]). His Honour went on at [44] to say: "The High Court did not say in either Craig or Yusuf that there was jurisdictional error if the exercise of power might have been affected but is thereby affected (Craig) or in a way that affects it (Yusuf).
