<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 667">As Glenhurst was a company in liquidation, the Applicant sought leave nunc pro tunc to begin and proceed with the proceedings pursuant to s 471B of the Act. On 16 September 2008, Finkelstein J granted the Applicant leave: Goodman v Glenhurst Corporation Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1482. As his Honour noted in paragraph [3] of his reasons for decision, "the reason the [A]pplicant seeks leave to bring an action against an insolvent company is that [Glenhurst] has insurance cover which may indemnify it in respect to the claims being advanced by the Applicant and the group members. " The insurer was QBE Insurance (Australia) Limited (ACN 003 191 035) ( QBE ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1425">The principles applicable to the grant of leave, pursuant to s 500(2) CA, or in similar positions of insolvency, are canvassed in a number of authorities, which are collected, very conveniently, by Jacobson J in Altinova Nominees Pty Ltd v Leveraged Capital Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) (No 2) [2009] FCA 42 (at [17]-[23] of that decision. In Goodman v Glenhurst Corporation Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1482 , Finkelstein J took the view that the Court is required to be satisfied that the applicant's claim was sufficiently serious to be allowed to proceed. The underlying theory for that was that the liquidator should not be vexed with the obligation to fight a hopeless case and incur unnecessary expenditure. His Honour went on to consider the details involved in that proceeding and noted that he had not formed any firm view about the merits but was satisfied that the claim in that instance, both on behalf of the applicant and the then respondent, for indemnity against the insurer, had a solid foundation. Nevertheless, he anticipated that the claims would be hotly disputed. </sentence>
