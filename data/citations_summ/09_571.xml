<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 547">In Ruaro v Ferrari [2008] FCA 307 Emmett J (one of the majority in Dukemaster ) awarded indemnity costs where rejection of an offer had been "imprudent and unreasonable". His Honour did not refer to the authorities. In Olivaylle Pty Ltd v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA (No 5) [2009] FCA 571 Logan J indicated that, if there was any difference in substance between Black v Lipovac and Dukemaster he would (as had Sackville J) prefer to follow Black v Lipovac . In Alexander v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (No 3) [2010] FCA 506 Bromberg J also rejected a test of "plainly unreasonable", referring to Black v Lipovac . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 334">The respondents advanced an argument that they were entitled to costs on an indemnity basis or at least on the ordinary basis from 24 May 2010. Foundational to that submission was an offer the respondents made on 21 May 2010 to pay Entirity $20,000 in full and final settlement of the proceedings (including the cross-claim), with each party to bear their own costs. The offer was open until 24 May 2010. Counsel for Entirity asserted in written submissions (an assertion not put in issue in later written submissions from the respondents) that the offer was served in the afternoon of a Friday (21 May 2010) and was expressed to expire on the Monday (24 May 2010). Again not disputed, was the assertion that Entirity did not reject the offer but simply did not respond within the stipulated time. It is accepted that the power to award indemnity costs can be enlivened by an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise: Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 to [5] at 233 and more generally the recent discussion by Logan J in Olivaylle Pty Ltd v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA (No 5) [2009] FCA 571. Often this question is approached on the basis of whether the conduct of the party against whom indemnity costs are sought was unreasonable or imprudent: see Ruaro v Ferrari [2008] FCA 307 at [15] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 1018">In circumstances where the Applicant has been wholly unsuccessful and the Respondent has made an offer more beneficial than the court order, the provision creates a presumptive or prima facie entitlement to indemnity costs in favour of the Respondent: Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pty Ltd (No.4) [2009] FCA 803 at [11] ; Olivayille Pty Ltd v Flottweg GMBH and Co KGAA (No.5) [2009] FCA 571. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 381">As can be seen from a study of its terms, the then O 23 r 11(5), though directed to the subject of an offer of compromise made by a respondent, did not deal with the situation where an applicant's claim fails completely such that the proceeding is subsequently dismissed.

 (3) An offer to pay a sum of money is, unless a notice of offer otherwise provides, taken to be an offer to pay that sum within 28 days after acceptance of the offer. 
 
 
 
 
The evolution of these Rules, and in particular the inclusion of O 23 r 11, has been helpfully traced by Logan J in Olivaylle Pty Ltd v Flottweg GMBH and Co KGAA (No 5) [2009] FCA 571 at [6] to [8]. </sentence>
