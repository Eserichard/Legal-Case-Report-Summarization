 B.2 What is legal advice? 

 
41. In Australian Wheat Board v Cole (No 5) [89] ( Cole ), Young J touched on what is encompassed within the expression " legal advice ":
 
" The concept of legal advice is fairly wide.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] VSC 308">58 The plaintiffs argue that before the reports were commissioned the Royal Commission had been announced. Ms Rands admits in her affidavit that she anticipated the report she commissioned from Mr Hartrick would be employed by herself and Powercor's external lawyers to assist them in relation to issues being examined by the Royal Commission. [49] The plaintiffs contend that the only inference that can be drawn is that the investigation was critical for the purposes of the Royal Commission. The plaintiffs contend that the Royal Commission was not a legal proceeding for the purposes of s 119 (litigation privilege) although legal advice privilege is still available in connection with the preparation of evidence for possible use at the inquiry. [50] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] NSWSC 550">Austin J added that there is no disclosure "if what is adduced in evidence merely causes the reader to "wonder or speculate whether legal advice has been obtained and what was the substance of that advice"". (The quotation in this sentence of his Honour's reasons was taken from the decision of Young J in AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 at [133] ). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] VSC 162">43 Counsel for the appellant submitted that on its proper construction s.104B(2)(g) did not require disclosure of medical reports, correspondence and other documents provided to and obtained from medical practitioners when they were properly the subject of a claim of legal professional privilege. Dr McNicol submitted that as privilege was an important and fundamental common law immunity, a statutory provision such as s.104B(2)(g) should not be construed as abrogating the immunity from disclosure conferred by privilege in the absence of clear words or a necessary implication to that effect. [21] She further submitted that a generally expressed provision requiring production of documents did not abrogate privilege. As Young J stated in AWB Ltd v Cole: [22] 
 
 
 Powers that are conferred in general terms ... will not be construed as abrogating or adversely affecting a fundamental common law right or immunity, unless Parliament makes its intention unmistakably clear ... 
 Lord Hoffman put the same point more bluntly in R v Secretary for Home Department; Ex parte Simms [1999] UKHL 33 ; [2000] 2 AC 115 at 131 by saying that 'Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words' ...  28 These submissions by counsel for the appellant only highlight the glaring lack of evidence as to the purpose of the Walton report at the time it was created and the intention of the person who authorised or procured it. [14] There was nothing to support the appellant's argument that facts (d) and (e) established that the dominant or clearly paramount purpose of the report was for the giving of legal advice, rather than simply to satisfy the mandatory statutory requirements. It is clear that if there are two purposes of equal weight, or if they are of roughly similar weight, it cannot be said that there is a dominant purpose. In such situations, one purpose does not prevail over the other. [15] Although I consider that both of these facts would suggest that the dominant purpose of the Walton report was to obtain an assessment as to the degree of permanent impairment, it is sufficient for present purposes to conclude that, given the state of the evidence before the Magistrate, it was open to him to find on the basis of facts (d) and (e) that this was the dominant purpose of obtaining the Walton report and that it was not for the giving of legal advice. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2011] NSWSC 353">The question therefore is whether disclosure was under compulsion of law (s 122(5)(a)(iii)). There is no doubt that the giving of the discovery of the document was under compulsion of law. However, the defendant was entitled to withhold the document from inspection if it was a " privileged document " (Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005, r 21.5 (2)). The document was a privileged document if it contained information of which evidence could not, by virtue of the operation of Div 1 of Pt 3.10 of the Evidence Act , be adduced in the proceedings over objection. At common law records made either by the lawyer or by the client of the advice sought or given are privileged, even though those records do not themselves constitute the communication of the request for advice or of the advice given ( AWB Limited v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 232 ALR 743 at [127] - [133]).

I am concerned with the dominant purpose limb of legal professional privilege in this case and will refer to some of the relevant principles in the following paragraphs. [132] As he said:
 
" The crucial difference between the first and second limbs of the privilege is that the second limb is not limited to communications whose dominant purpose is the giving or obtaining of legal advice. Principles relating to the dominant purpose limb of the formulation were examined by Young J in AWB Limited v The Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole [130] and in AWB Limited v The Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 5) .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2011] FCA 245"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] AATA 928">The unwillingness to disclose Dr Morgan's opinion based on legal professional privilege is curious. Such privilege must rely on confidential communication between a lawyer and client in their "professional relationship" and must be for a privileged purpose which was dominant (ss 118-199 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth); Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 201 CLR 49 at 72). This privilege quarantines the communication, not the document per se [ AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 152 FCR 382 at 417]. Privilege is often used to protect a party from exposure to criminal or civil penalties. Here, the applicant seeks to use the privilege but is not exposed to any potential civil or criminal penalty. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] FamCA 644">The weight of the authorities, in my view, supports the conclusion that the disclosure of the conclusion reached in or course of action recommended by, an advice can amount to waiver of privilege in respect of the premises relating to the opinion which has been disclosed, notwithstanding that this reasoning is not disclosed. By way of illustration, if there is a disclosure that a client has been advised that interpretation "A" is preferable to interpretation "B" of a legislative provision, then even if there is no disclosure of the reasoning leading to that conclusion, the reasoning and content of the advice may be waived, including the factual premises and circumstances leading to that conclusion. The issue of recording the receipt of legal advice and disclosing the substance of that advice was considered by Young J in AWB Ltd v Cole and Another [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 232 ALR 743. His Honour said (at 136): 
"In my view, the distinction between a mere reference to advice having been obtained, and a reference that discloses the content or substance of the advice, has not been eliminated by the High Court's restatement of the relevant principles as to waiver in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1... .</sentence>

<sentence id="cs13" from="[2010] FCA 252">The Brief, while containing a great deal of legal advice itself, also records both legal advice and instructions seeking legal advice. Insofar as the redacted secondary records are concerned, there is no doubt (in principle) that legal professional privilege may be claimed. This has been expressed in many ways, as the authorities discussed by Young J in AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 152 FCR 382 (at [127]-[131]) reveal: 
 
 Recording legal advice 
 

 
 
 [127] As an adjunct to the first limb of the privilege, protection against disclosure has been extended to documents that record confidential legal advice or confidential legal work. Examples commonly given include legal research memoranda, draft pleadings, summaries of argument and draft agreements: see Daniels at [44] per McHugh J; Propend at 550 per McHugh J and at 569 per Gummow J; Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 496 per Dawson J; Trade Practices Commission v Sterling at 246 per Lockhart J; Mostyn v West Mostyn Coal and Iron Co Ltd (1876) 34 LT 531 ; and Packer v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (Qld) [1984] 1 Qd R 275 at 284-285. 
 

 
 
 [128] Anderson J explained the scope of this protection and the reasons for it in Dalleagles (at 333-334): 
 

 
 
 
 What is protected, of course, is that which is communicated between solicitor and client.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2010] NSWSC 640">7 However, it is well-established that inadvertent disclosure does not result in a waiver or loss of privilege, although this has typically happened when documents which are entitled to privilege have been produced inadvertently: see Hooker Corporation Limited v Darling Harbour Authority (1987) 9 NSWLR 538 and AWB Limited v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 152 FCR 382. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FCA 1293">While the nomenclature in case law often refers to documents it is to be remembered that 'privilege protects confidential communications, and not documents as such. As Dawson J said in Propend at 515 "... to say that a document is privileged is merely a shorthand way of saying that the communication constituted by the document is privileged"' ( AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 152 FCR 382 per Young J at [102]). Justice Young went on to observe at [103]: 
 
 The decision in Propend turned fundamentally on the proposition that legal professional privilege protects communications rather than documents. This explains why, as the High Court held in Propend , legal professional privilege can attach to copies of non-privileged documents; the purpose of bringing the copy into existence may be different from the purpose of bringing the original into existence, and may attract legal professional privilege: see Brennan CJ at 507, Gaudron J at 544, McHugh J at 553-554, Gummow J at 571 and Kirby J at 587. 
 

 The Basis of the Applicants' Claims
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] NSWIRComm 148">13 Young J reviewed the relevant authorities and principles which govern legal advice privilege in AWB Ltd v Cole and Another [2006] FCA 571 ; 152 FCR 382 at [60] - [63] and [85] - [110]. In AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 ; (2006) 155 FCR 30 , his Honour summarised the general principles as follows at [44]:

 
 
 The general principles that I consider relevant to the disposition of this case can be summarised as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 (1) The party claiming privilege carries the onus of proving that the communication was undertaken, or the document was brought into existence, for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice. The onus might be discharged by evidence as to the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred or the documents were brought into existence, or by evidence as to the purposes of the person who made the communication, or authored the document, or procured its creation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] NSWCA 179">19 Legal professional privilege at common law protected confidential communications, not documents as such. In AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 232 ALR 743 , 766-7 Young J (of the Federal Court) held that this was established by Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1996] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501. He said:
 

 
 
 "... it must be kept firmly in mind that the privilege protects confidential communications, and not documents as such. As Dawson J. said in Propend (above) at 515 'to say that a document is privileged is merely a shorthand way of saying that the communication constituted by the document is privileged': see also per Toohey J at 525, Gaudron J at 543, McHugh J at 552, and Gummow J at 569. The decision in Propend turned fundamentally on the proposition that legal professional privilege protects communications rather than documents. This explains why, as the High Court held ... legal professional privilege can attach to copies of non-privileged documents; the purpose of bringing the copy into existence may be different from the purpose of bringing the original into existence, and may attract legal professional privilege. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] NSWCA 100">60 A common law claim for legal professional privilege was recently discussed by Giles JA, with whom Mason P and Beazley JA agreed, in State of NSW v Jackson [2007] NSWCA 279. At [24] his Honour said: 
 

 
"In ruling on a claim to legal professional privilege or client legal privilege the court may inspect the relevant documents ( Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 677, 688-9; Trade Practices Commission v Sterling [1979] FCA 33 ; (1979) 36 FLR 244 at 246-7; Woollahra Municipal Council v Westpac Banking Corporation (1994) 33 NSWLR 529 at 541-2; Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation at [52]; AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 152 FCR 382 at 391; see also s 133 of the Act). Inspection is discretionary ( Grant v Downs at 688-9; Mallalla District Council v Livestock Markets Ltd [2006] SASC 80 ; (2006) 94 SASR 258 at [30] ), for such assistance as it may provide in arriving at the documents' status. In Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation at [52] Gleeson CJ and Gaudron and Gummow JJ said, after observing that a claim for privilege is not conclusively established by use of a verbal formula, that a court 'should not be hesitant to exercise' its power to examine documents. Where the parties have put evidence before the court, however, beyond the use of a verbal formula, I respectfully remain of the view expressed in Woollahra Municipal Council v Westpac Banking Corporation at 542, that the court should not unnecessarily pay regard to material which can not be known to the party challenging the claim to privilege. "</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2009] NSWSC 225">To say (as does the ACCC) that the finalised proofs of evidence were created and served for the existing litigation can be accepted. However, in our view it is impossible for litigation privilege to attach to the finalised proofs of evidence, when the finalised proofs of evidence were created for the purpose of serving them on the ACCC's opponent and when they were in fact served on that opponent.

 [42] There have been other comments that indicate that the rationale of litigation privilege is to secure a fair trial within the adversarial process and to facilitate the common law mode of trial: see Southern Equities Corporation Ltd v West Australian Government Holdings Ltd (1993) 10 WAR 1 at 21 per Seaman J; Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victorian Workcover Authority [2002] VSCA 59 ; (2002) 4 VR 332 at 336 per Batt JA; Wheeler v Le Marchant (1881) 17 Ch D 675 at 685 and AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 152 FCR 382 at 424 at [158] per Young J. All formulations emphasise, in one way or another, that the communications made or materials to be protected are those which are made confidentially between the client and the legal representative or otherwise come into existence for the dominant purpose of the litigation, and which are to be kept away from the opposing party.

<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] NSWLEC 247">10 What constitutes " legal advice " takes its character from the relevant legal context. In Re Southland at [14](d) Austin J held:
[14](d) Legal advice --- s 118 protects certain confidential communications and the contents of confidential documents made or prepared for the dominant purpose of a lawyer providing legal advice to a client. In this context, legal advice is understood in a pragmatic sense. In General Manager, WorkCover Authority of NSW v Law Society of NSW [2006] NSWCA 84 at [77] to [78], McColl JA quoted, evidently with approval, the observation of Taylor LJ in Balabel v Air India [1988] Ch 317 , at 330, that legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law; it must include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context . This assumes, of course, that the advice is professional advice given by a lawyer in his or her capacity as such. Taylor LJ's dictum was applied in Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No 6) [2004] UKHL 48 ; [2005] 1 AC 610 , at 648 per Lord Scott of Foscote, 657 per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, and 678 per Lord Carswell. There the House of Lords held that the Bank was entitled to claim legal professional privilege in respect of communications with its solicitors not only concerning its legal rights and obligations, but also concerning the presentation of its evidence to an inquiry so as to minimise criticism. See also DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Intertan Inc (2003) 135 FCR 151 ; 203 ALR 348 ; [2003] FCA 1191 ; AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2008] AATA 580">" [251] 
 
 
The qualification is that the purpose need only be the dominant purpose and not the sole purpose. [252] 
 
 
180. Young J focused on the second of the two limbs in AWB Ltd v Cole : [253] 
 
" A traditional formulation of the second limb of legal professional privilege is that it applies to confidential communications passing between a client, the client's legal adviser and third parties for the dominant purpose of use in or in relation to litigation which is either pending or in contemplation: see FCT v Pratt Holdings [ [254] ] at 284 [39] per Kenny J. This formulation was referred to, with apparent approval, by Finn J in the Full Court in Pratt Holdings [ [255] ] at 360 [6]; see also Grant v Downs [ [256] ] at 677 per Barwick CJ. 
 
 The crucial difference between the first and second limbs of the privilege is that the second limb is not limited to communications whose dominant purpose is the giving or obtaining the legal advice. This formulation was referred to, with apparent approval, by Finn J in the Full Court in Pratt Holdings [ [255] ] at 360 [6]; see also Grant v Downs [ [256] ] at 677 per Barwick CJ. 
 
 The crucial difference between the first and second limbs of the privilege is that the second limb is not limited to communications whose dominant purpose is the giving or obtaining the legal advice. Communications lacking this advice element, such a communications between a solicitor and a prospective expert witness, will attract privilege where they occur in a litigation context ... "... [257] 
 
 
181. The reason for legal professional privilege was explained by Advocate General Sir Gordon Glynn:
 
" Whether it is described as the right of the client or the duty of the lawyer, this principle has nothing to do with the protection or privilege of the lawyer. It springs essentially from the basic need of a man in a civilised society to be able to turn to his lawyer for advice and help, and if the proceedings begin, for representation; it springs no less from the advantages to a society which evolves complex law reaching into all the business affairs of persons, real and legal, that they should be able to know what they can do under the law, what is forbidden, where they must tread circumspectly, where they run risks. In my view, the authorities establish that the reason why litigation privilege has been recognised as a substantive rule of law and as a fundamental right, is that it operates to secure a fair civil or criminal trial within our adversarial system of justice. The rationale for litigation privilege does not support its extension to a commission of inquiry. " [279] 
 
 
195. Young J also referred to the statement by Dawson J in Waterford , to which I have referred before distinguishing proceedings in the commission of inquiry with which he was concerned:
 
" In my opinion, it is one thing to extend litigation privilege to adversarial proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal is vested with statutory authority to determine issues with legally binding consequences. The location and retention of witnesses, expert or otherwise, is really an adjunct of adversarial litigation and, in my view, does not warrant such an extension. 
 
 Given the applicability of legal advice privilege in the context of a commission of inquiry, I am not persuaded that the broad rationale for legal professional privilege justifies the extension of the litigation limb so as to include a commission of inquiry. " [280] 
 
 
196. Justice Young's judgment cannot be said to have answered the question we have posed in the heading to this section of our reasons. His Honour did not need to decide it and his views must be regarded as obiter dicta but it would seem from his judgment that he clearly accepted that the High Court had determined that proceedings in the Tribunal came within the concept of legal proceedings for the purpose of the application of the doctrine of legal professional privilege. That is whether the notes or the drafts are of any relevance or assistance in deciding the issues. If they are, she claimed that, except to the extent that it had already been waived, all were protected from disclosure by legal professional privilege. Ms McLeod supported her submission by reference to the principles stated in Waterford v Commonwealth of Australia [242] ( Waterford ) and AWB Ltd v Cole [243] ( AWB ). The judgment of Bergin J in Ingot Capital Investments v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets [244] ( Ingot ) to the effect that there was no proper basis on which legal professional privilege applies in the Tribunal, stands apart from the principles established in Waterford and in AWB and they bind us. Ms McLeod acknowledged that, up until the time of the ruling, there had been no waiver of the privilege but that she had made no objection to questions to that time regarding the subject of the notes and the contents of the drafts.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2008] FCA 265">61 In short, attachment 2 was not prepared by a legal practitioner and there is no relevant legal context. Accordingly, it does not attract client legal privilege or litigation privilege: see AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2005) 152 FCR 382 at [144] - [145].
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] FMCA 235">Although the affidavit and oral evidence of Mr Dalgleish on this subject is sparse, nevertheless the circumstances to which he has deposed show that the communications were created for one or more privileged purposes. In reaching this conclusion I have approached the matter as a question which must be determined objectively and which will not necessarily be determined by the evidence of the person who caused the communications to be brought into existence: Commissioner of Taxation v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1247 ; (2005) 225 ALR 266 per Kenny J at 278 [30]; AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole [2006] FCA 571 per Young J at [110]. I have taken the opportunity to inspect the relevant documents which were produced to the Court and that inspection confirms my view that the communications in question were brought into existence in circumstances attracting legal professional privilege. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] FCA 88">7 It is sufficient for present purposes to begin by stating that in order to maintain a claim of legal professional privilege, a proponent must demonstrate the communication is protected by "advice privilege" or "litigation privilege. " The relationship between the two types of legal professional privilege is just one of the matters that is unclear in Australian privilege law. Some cases support the proposition that "litigation privilege is a separate category of legal professional privilege ": Public Transport Authority of Western Australia v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2007] WASCA 151 at [18] ; See also R v King [2007] 2 NZLR 137 ; Westgold Resources NL v St Barbara Mines Ltd [2007] WASC 47 ; Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victorian Work Cover Authority [2002] VSCA 59 ; (2002) 4 VR 332 ; Southern Equities Corporation Ltd v West Australian Government Holdings Ltd (1993) 10 WAR 1 and Dingle v Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia (1989) 23 FCR 63. On the other hand, it is also true that the " High Court has yet to make clear whether litigation privilege has an existence and rationale distinct from the advice privilege ": eg, Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [20] ; AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 152 FCR 382 ; Ingot Capital Investments Pty Ltd v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets Ltd [2006] NSWSC 530 ; (2006) 67 NSWLR 91 ; Westpac Banking Corporation v 789Ten Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 321 ; (2005) 55 ACSR 519 and Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2007] FamCA 1444">The doctrine of privilege protects a confidential communication, whether oral or documentary, from disclosure in circumstances where its dominant purpose was giving or receiving legal advice or for use in existing or anticipated litigation. [4] Both factual instructions and advice given about the law or available options are protected if the relevant communication satisfies this test. [5] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2007] NSWCA 279">
 

24 In ruling on a claim to legal professional privilege or client legal privilege the court may inspect the relevant documents ( Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 677, 688-9; Trade Practices Commission v Sterling [1979] FCA 33 ; (1979) 36 FLR 244 at 246-7; Woollahra Municipal Council v Westpac Banking Corporation (1994) 33 NSWLR 529 at 541-2; Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation at [52]; AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 152 FCR 382 at 391; see also s 133 of the Act). Inspection is discretionary ( Grant v Downs at 688-9; Mallalla District Council v Livestock Markets Ltd [2006] SASC 80 ; (2006) 94 SASR 258 at [30] ), for such assistance as it may provide in arriving at the documents' status. In Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation at [52] Gleeson CJ and Gaudron and Gummow JJ said, after observing that a claim for privilege is not conclusively established by use of a verbal formula, that a court "should not be hesitant to exercise" its power to examine documents. Where the parties have put evidence before the court, however, beyond the use of a verbal formula, I respectfully remain of the view expressed in Woollahra Municipal Council v Westpac Banking Corporation at 542, that the court should not unnecessarily pay regard to material which can not be known to the party challenging the claim to privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2007] AATA 1841">As Young J said in AWB Limited v Cole and Another [2006] FCA 571 at [60] when referring to Daniels : 
 
 ... legal professional privilege applies to communications between a client and his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services, including representation in legal proceedings. ... 
 

Three issues are raised by this statement. The first is whether the document was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2007] AATA 1792">The question of whether litigation privilege applies in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal must ultimately be answered by resort to questions of principle. Bergin J assessed these questions in Ingot and so did Young J, in the context of a commission of inquiry, in AWB Ltd v Cole Ltd [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 152 FCR 382. Bergin J, who relied heavily on Young J, arrived at her conclusion in the following sentence: 
 
 ... I am satisfied that the AAT stands outside what Young J referred to in AWB as the 'adversarial system of justice'. 
 

 This sentence flows from a detailed analysis which places much emphasis on the characterisation of proceedings as either "inquisitorial" or "adversarial" and attributes consequences to the result. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs30" from="[2007] FCAFC 88">5 As to the first ground of appeal, it is settled legal principle that the relevant time at which a claim for privilege is to be determined is the time when the document came into existence . The relevant question is whether the document came into existence for the dominant purpose of seeking legal advice or assistance. If the document satisfies that description, then it is privileged from production. The same question also applies in relation to copies of documents where the test is whether the copy itself came into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice or assistance. These principles are spelt out in a number of decisions, including National Employers' Mutual General Insurance Association Ltd v Waind [1979] HCA 11 ; (1979) 141 CLR 648 at 654 (per Mason J); Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 508-509 (per Brennan CJ), 543-544 (per Gaudron J); 552-553 (per McHugh J) and 569 (per Gummow J) (" Propend "); and Esso Australia at 65-66 (per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ). A recent and helpful resume of the principles of legal professional privilege relevant to the obtaining and recording of legal advice was conducted by Young J in AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 152 FCR 382 at 405-420.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs31" from="[2007] VSC 292">17 The relevant principles relating to legal professional privilege are not contentious in this case, and I do not propose to recite them here, given the urgency of the matter. They were helpfully and recently summarised by Young J in the two recent AWB decisions: AWB Ltd v Cole [5] and AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5). [6] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs32" from="[2007] FamCA 786">20. In AWB v Cole [4] and AWB Ltd v Honourable Terrence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 5) [5] Young J observed: 
 
 
 The onus might be discharged by evidence as to the circumstances and context in which the communications occurred or the documents were brought into existence, or by evidence as to the purposes of the person who made the communication, or authored the document, or procured its creation. It might also be discharged by reference to the nature of the documents, supported by argument or submissions. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs35" from="[2006] NSWSC 1281">21 The onus of establishing the claim for client legal privilege falls on the party asserting or claiming the privilege and is met by establishing the facts giving rise to the claim: Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 689; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Lux Pty Limited [2003] FCA 89 at [42] ; Re Southland Coal Pty Limited at [14](c). Mere assertion of the claim, by way of a formulaic claim, is not enough: AWB Limited v Cole [2006] FCA 571 ; (2006) 152 FCR 382 at 402 [63] . What is required is exposure of facts from which an informed decision can be made as to whether the claim for privilege is supportable: National Crime Authority v S (1991) 29 FCR 203 at 211-212; AWB Limited v Cole (No. 5) [2006] FCA 1234 at [44]. The facts are to be proved on the balance of probabilities: s.142 Evidence Act 1995 .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs36" from="[2006] NSWSC 1108">111 The Federal Court has also recently considered the matter in AWB Ltd v Cole (No 1) [2006] FCA 571 and (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 , both decisions of Neil Young J. His Honour said in the first judgment [136]:

"In my view, the distinction between a mere reference to advice having been obtained, and a reference that discloses the content or substance of the advice, has not been eliminated by the High Court's restatement of the relevant principles as to waiver in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1990) 201 CLR 1". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs37" from="[2006] FCA 1234">As argued before me, the case focused on three issues. The first issue is whether AWB has established its claim that legal professional privilege attaches to each of the documents that remain in contest. The only head of privilege that AWB relies on is the privilege that attaches to documents brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice. In AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole [2006] FCA 571 ( 'AWB v Cole' ), I held that litigation privilege was not available to protect documents brought into existence in contemplation of the Commission and none of the parties has disputed that decision. AWB has not contended that legal professional privilege is available solely because documents were brought into existence in contemplation of inquiries being undertaken by the PSI or by the IIC. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs38" from="[2006] NSWSC 899">Taylor LJ's dictum was applied in Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No 6) [2004] UKHL 48 ; [2005] 1 AC 610 , at 648 per Lord Scott of Foscote, 657 per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, and 678 per Lord Carswell. There the House of Lords held that the Bank was entitled to claim legal professional privilege in respect of communications with its solicitors not only concerning its legal rights and obligations, but also concerning the presentation of its evidence to an inquiry so as to minimise criticism. See also DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd v InterTAN Inc [2003] FCA 1191 ; [2003] FCA 1191 ; (2003) 135 FCR 151 ; AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571. (e) Whether disclosure would result from adducing the evidence - Under both s 118 and s 119 the evidence is not to be adduced if adducing evidence would result in disclosure of certain confidential communications or the contents of certain confidential documents. The question is whether what is disclosed by adducing the evidence explicitly reveals the confidential communication or the contents of the confidential document, or supports an inference of fact as to the content of the confidential communication or document, which has a definite and reasonable foundation. Purpose cannot be proved by mere assertion by a third party. Normally (but not always) the relevant purpose is that of the maker of the communication for which privilege is sought. (h) Dominant purpose - The dominant purpose of the communication must be determined objectively, having regard to all the circumstances in which the communication was made and its nature ( Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 689, per Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ; Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1247 ; (2006) 225 ALR 266 , at [30] per Kenny J; AWB Ltd v Cole [2006] FCA 571 at [110] , per Young J). What is required is an objective view of all of the evidence, taking into account the evidence not only of the author of the communication but of the person or authority under whose direction the document was prepared. If the document would have been prepared irrespective of the intention to obtain professional legal services, it will not satisfy the test ( Grant v Downs , at 688, per Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ).</sentence>

 obviously attaches to a document conveying legal advice from solicitor to client and to a specific request from the client for such advice. But it does not follow that all other communications between them lack privilege. In most solicitor and client relationships, especially where a transaction involves protracted dealings, advice may be required or appropriate on matters great or small at various stages. There will be a continuum of communication and meetings between the solicitor and the client. ... Where information is passed by the solicitor or client to the other as part of the continuum aimed at keeping both informed so that advice may be sought and given as required, privilege will attach. A letter from the client containing information may end with such words as 'please advise me what I should do'. But, even if it does not, there will usually be implied in the relationship an overall expectation that the solicitor will at each stage, whether asked specifically or not, tender appropriate advice. Moreover, legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law; it must include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context. '

After my decision in AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole [2006] FCA 571 , AWB determined that a claim for privilege could not be maintained over the documents. AWB supplied the documents to the Inquiry under cover of a letter dated 25 May 2006 which stated that it did not claim legal professional privilege over the documents.
