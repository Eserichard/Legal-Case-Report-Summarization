<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 307">In the current circumstances, it would be an erroneous exercise of power to invoke s 31A concerning issues which have not previously been raised before a Court in relation to a statutory provision, the interpretation of which remains untested. Mr White referred to the decision in Barnett v Territory Insurance Office [2011] FCA 155 where Justice Marshall held that if the applicant's proposition is arguable the appropriate course is that the claim should await trial. Mr White referred to the decision in PZ Cussons (International) Ltd v Rosa Dora Imports Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1642 ; [2007] 74 IPR 372 at [13] where Justice Kenny stated: The key is to address the statutory question. That is, under s 31A, in order to grant summary judgment, I must be satisfied that the respondents have no reasonable prospect of success in defending the infringement claim. As s 31A(3) makes clear, this does not mean that I must be satisfied that their defence is hopeless or bound to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1431">In Deckers Outdoor Corporation Inc v Farley &amp; Ors (No 2) [2009] FCA 256 ; (2009) 176 FCR 33 at 36-7 I observed that: 
 
 "11 Section 31A of the Federal Court Act was introduced to extend "the power of the court to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": see Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd (2008) 167 FCR 372 at 406 [124] (per Gordon J) (quoting from the Second Reading Speech of the Minister on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 (Cth)). The section empowers the Court to give summary judgement in favour of an applicant if it is satisfied that the respondent "has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding or [a] part of the proceeding": see s 31A(1)(b). A defence may have no reasonable prospect of success notwithstanding that it is not "hopeless" and not "bound to fail": see s 31A(3). 
 

 
 
 12 Plainly, s 31A was, as Lindgren J held in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [54] , designed "to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment" from the level that had been fixed by the High Court in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-2 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 128-130. Although the standard which must be met by an applicant who seeks summary judgment under the Federal Court Act has been expressed in a variety of different ways, where, as here, an application is made under s 31A, the Court is required to give close attention to the statutory language and to apply that test to the exclusion of all others. As Kenny J said in PZ Cussons (International) Ltd v Rosa Dora Imports Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1642 ; (2007) 74 IPR 372 at [13] :
 'The key is to address the statutory question.
