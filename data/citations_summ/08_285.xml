<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 449">Mr McCarthy, acting for seven of those summonsed, referred the Tribunal to the general principles that apply to the issue of summonses. These are the same principles that apply to the issues of summonses by a court. The principles were discussed in a recent decision by Deputy President Forgie: General Merchandise and Apparel Group Pty Ltd and CEO of Customs and anor [2009] AATA 988 , at [205] ff. The grounds on which a summons may be set aside include that it is oppressive, that it was not issued in good faith for the purpose of obtaining relevant evidence and that the person to whom the summons was issued is unable to give relevant evidence: Botany Bay Instrumentation &amp; Control Pty Ltd v Stewart (1984) 3 NSWLR 98 at 100 (per Powell J). Bennett J noted in Comcare v Maganga [2008] FCA 285 , at [37]: 
 
 the test of relevance is whether the documents relate to the proceedings such that there is a real possibility that they may assist in the resolution of issues in the proceedings ... 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 35">In Comcare v Maganga (2008) 101 ALD 68 ; [2008] FCA 285 Bennett J considered the same issue. At [31] Bennett J referred to the decision of Weinberg J in Fried . Her Honour said that the subpoena in Fried was "issued to capture documents which might have shown that two non party companies had lodged income tax returns without fully declaring interest earned". However, the substantive proceedings between the parties in Fried did not concern alleged under-reporting of income tax. Accordingly, Bennett J said that the documents in question in Fried related not only to a credit issue, but also an issue unrelated to the issue in the proceedings. It was this, her Honour said, that enabled Weinberg J to conclude that the documents sought were "wholly unconnected" to the issues. In Maganga , however, as her Honour's reasons in [32] disclose, Fried was distinguishable. Mr Maganga's credit, he being a party to the proceeding, constituted the main issue in the proceeding. Bennett J accepted that there should be a legitimate forensic purpose in seeking the relevant documents which purpose "must be identifiable and likely to facilitate the conduct of the proceeding, not merely to oppress a party or witness" (citing Fried at [29]) but found, in the circumstances, that the documents in question fulfilled those criteria. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 988">[252] 
 
 
233.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 843"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] AATA 231">This was the approach taken by Tamberlin J in Comcare v Maganga [72] and he is following in the footsteps of, for example, Spender J in Cosco Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner for Taxation &amp; Anor . [80] 
 
 
78.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] AATA 580">[193] We adopt what was said there but will highlight one or two matters. The first is that the principles developed by the courts in relation to subpoenas is relevant. This was the approach taken by Bennett J in Comcare v Maganga [194] and he is following in the footsteps of, for example, Spender J in Cosco Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner for Taxation &amp; Anor . [195] 
 
 
136. It is clear from those authorities that it is relevant to ask whether the material sought by the summons has: 
 
 "... an apparent relevance to the issues in the principal proceedings, ie, is adjectival, as distinct from substantive, relevance established? As Bennett J said in Comcare v Maganga :
 
" ... the test of relevance is whether the documents relate to the proceedings such that there is a real possibility that they may assist in the resolution of issues in the proceedings ... 
 
 Further, the test of relevance for the purpose of inspection is not confined to whether the documents in question will or may establish an inconsistent statement by a witness giving evidence in the proceedings or whether the documents themselves will prove a fact in issue. The Court may allow documents to be inspected if they are apparently relevant or are on the subject matter of the litigation ... or if they might be used for a legitimate forensic purpose in cross-examination ... ". [203] 
 
 
140. Also relevant in considering whether a summons should be issued or whether it, or aspects of it, should be set aside is whether compliance with it would be oppressive but we need do no more than mention it in this case. What is important is from our analysis of the Tribunal's powers under ss 37 and 40 is that they are directed to what is relevant in the case of s 37(1)(b), what may be relevant in the case of s 37(2) and to what could possibly, but not necessarily will, throw light on the issues in the case of s 40.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] AATA 330">An example is found in Comcare v Maganga , [16] in which Bennett J considered whether the Tribunal had denied procedural fairness to Comcare by refusing it access to summonsed documents and so denying them the opportunity to refer to them when cross-examining the applicant. " [18]

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] AATA 397">It is settled law that the general principles relating to the issue of subpoenas by a court apply to the issue of a summons under s 40(1A) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (the AAT Act): Cosco Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] FCA 1504 ; (1997) 37 ATR 432. A party is thus not entitled to compel the production and inspection of a document by issuing a subpoena or summons, unless it is needed for a legitimate forensic purpose: Attorney-General for NSW v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 at 681-682. The material sought must have some "apparent potential relevance" to the matters in issue: Australian Gas Light Co v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] FCA 1101 ; Comcare v Maganga [2008] FCA 285. </sentence>
