<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 803">However, he submitted, by its terms, the resolution of the Board made on 27 July 2005, does not "determine" to do anything. It merely authorises the Commission to do something. He compared the Board's resolution in this case with the resolution that was considered in CC Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 16 (" CC ") at [5]: " ...the Board resolved, in terms of the instrument provided to the Board, to authorise the ACC to investigate the matter and determined that it shall be a special investigation " (emphasis added). Here, he submitted, the words underlined are excluded from the resolution and the word "undertake" is included instead. Furthermore, he submitted s 7C(1)(c) of the Act only authorises the Commission to "undertake" a special intelligence operation, not a special investigation, which the Board's resolution purported to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1027">The applicant referred to CC Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 16 ; (2007) 66 ATR 39 in which Mansfield J, in referring to the 2003 authorisation and determination, said (at 46 [36]): 
 
 "The determination, as it stood at the time of the passing of the resolution set out at [5] above, was not an ideal document. It did not record the date and time at which it was made and it had the distinct appearance of a draft. " 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 580">As Mansfield J noted in CC Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) (2007) 66 ATR 39 ; [2007] FCA 16 at [26] the ACC Act "does not specify at all how the Board must 'determine, in writing' that an operation or investigation is a special operation or special investigation". Mansfield J held that the draft instrument became the Board's determination in writing on the passing of the vote to adopt the instrument (at [33]). The Full Court dismissed an appeal against Mansfield J's decision ( CC Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission (2007) 159 FCR 282 ; [2007] FCAFC 96). SS's attempt to find a point of distinction in the present case (namely, that there was no draft instrument before the Board and thus could be no resolution adopting the draft instrument so as to satisfy the requirement for a determination in writing) cannot succeed in the face of the evidence discussed above. The evidence, particularly the terms of the impugned ATS determination itself, establishes that the Board determined the ATS determination in writing, in accordance with that instrument, on 5 December 2007. Ground 2

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCAFC 96">
 1 The appellants appeal from the whole of a judgment given by a judge of the Court on 25 January 2007 ( CC Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 16). In the proceeding at first instance, the appellants challenged the validity of seven search warrants, the issue of which was procured by the first respondent, the Australian Crime Commission ("the ACC"). The warrants purported to authorise the executing officer to enter certain premises of the appellants and there to search for and seize things of a particular kind connected with a "special ACC investigation". </sentence>
