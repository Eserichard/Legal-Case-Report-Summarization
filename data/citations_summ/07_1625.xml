<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 447">In National Auto Glass Supplies (Australia) Pty Limited v Nielsen 
 &amp; Moller Autoglass (NSW) Pty Limited (No 8) [86] Graham J concluded that:
 
" As I understand the relevant authorities, the general presumption that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, foreign law is the same as Australian law is not inflexible. Where the law of the forum is governed by a statute and the law within Australia is itself lacking in uniformity, I doubt whether it could be presumed that the defamation law in China, including the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, is the same as it is in New South Wales. " [87] 
 
 
62. His Honour referred to other cases in which the presumption had been considered including Neilson but also Tisand (Pty) Ltd v Owners of the ship MV "Cape Moreton" (Ex "Freya") . [88] That case concerned the Cape Moreton, which had been arrested on the application of the applicants. Or that a written law of China would be interpreted and applied by a Chinese court in the same way as an Australian judge would do in construing a similar text. " [85]

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] NSWDC 264">57. The principles relevant to bad reputation were reviewed by the Court of Appeal in Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden [2002] NSWCA 419 at [1313] ff. As Graham J noted in National Auto Glass Supplies (Australia) Pty Limited v Nielsen and Moller Autoglass (NSW) Pty Limited (No 8) [2007] FCA 1625 when discussing the principles, a plaintiff with a bad reputation is entitled to lower damages because the injury is less. Graham J noted that criminal convictions were a good example of evidence of bad reputation. As Tobin and Sexton note at [22,055], particulars of bad reputation are governed by special rules of court and evidence of bad reputation may be led only where the provisions of the rules have been complied with. Particulars of bad reputation must be given prior to trial. Only evidence of the plaintiff's general standing and reputation in the community relevant to the defamatory remarks are admissible to prove reputation. The court should not be too precise in drawing boundaries between the various sectors of the plaintiff's life, but there must be some connection.</sentence>
