<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] AATA 528">The only decision which is under review by this proceeding is the decision made under s 613(1) of the Act. Only that decision can be reviewed. There is nothing to review under s 613(2) of the Act because a decision was not ever made under those provisions. A Statute that sets out strict conditions for eligibility for a particular benefit is not amenable to a construction that treats that which ought to have been done as though it had been done (refer Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Kelly [2006] FCA 659). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 302"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] AATA 1750">As stated by Justice Weinberg in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Kelly (2006) FCA 659: 
 
 "I would add that it is also difficult to see how something that manifestly did not occur can be deemed by a Tribunal, with retrospective effect, to have occurred, at least in the context of statutory criteria that are strict, and clearly stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] AATA 1432"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 63">In a recent similar case, Weinberg J said: "it is difficult to see how something that manifestly did not occur can be deemed by a tribunal, with retrospective effect, to have occurred, at least in the context of statutory criteria that are strict, and clearly stated" (see Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Kelly [2006] FCA 659 ; (2006) 151 FCR 534 at [29] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] AATA 17">30. The same reasoning leads to the conclusion that s 3(1)(e) of the Waiting Period Amendment Act would not assist them as a parent cannot be " a person who is a family member of an Australian citizen " when that Australian citizen is the person's child. As the Secretary has not made any decision under (c) of the definition of " family member " in s7(6D) of the SS Act to treat Dr Hussein or Mrs Abu Khalaf as a person described in (a) or (b) of the definition i.e. as a partner of the person or as a dependent child of the person, I cannot exercise his power and do so myself. [36] Even if I had the power, it is difficult to see on what basis I would exercise the discretion in favour of Dr Hussein or Mrs Abu Khalaf but I will not explore the matter further as it has not been the subject of submissions.
