<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 155">In that respect, I note that, as considered in SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2007) 233 CLR 18 ; [2007] HCA 40 , the test for relocation is whether it is reasonable, in the sense of being practicable in the particular circumstances of the particular applicant. The answer to that question depends upon the framework set by the particular objections raised to relocation (see SZMCD Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2009) 174 FCR 415 ; [2009] FCAFC 46). In SZMZV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1380 (at [20]), Bennett J indicated that the Tribunal has no obligation to make its own further inquiries about the reasonableness of relocation in circumstances where there were no obvious impediments to relocation other than the objections raised by an applicant, which had to be considered and dealt with by the Tribunal. In this case, the Tribunal considered not only the objections raised by the applicant, but also issues in relation to his wife and the reasonableness of relocation having regard to his personal circumstances, employment history and financial capacity, his wife's situation and country information. No jurisdictional error is established in the Tribunal's consideration of relocation. </sentence>
