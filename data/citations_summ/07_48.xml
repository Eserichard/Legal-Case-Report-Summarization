  40 Mr Bick says that a survey of the case law including the earlier cases such as Re BPTC (in liq) (No. 5) [9] and Meteyard v Love [10] and Re Bernsteen (No. 2) [11] reveals that a summons for public examination will be set aside for being too wide uncertain or oppressive where the documentation sought (a) does not properly relate to the examinable affairs of a corporation; (b) are otherwise not required for the examination; [12] (c) relate to the disclosure of particularly sensitive documents, such as privileged or confidential documents; [13] and/or (d) are too broad in time or description or go far beyond the legitimate interests of the liquidator.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 429">Counsel for Mr Strazdins asked me to make an order amending the summons. I indicated that I would allow Mr Strazdins to amend the summons. It seemed to me that I had the power to amend the summons (see, for example, the approach taken by Mansfield J in In the matter of Bernsteen Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (No 2) [2007] FCA 48 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 129 ; see also O 35 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules ) and that it was an appropriate case in which to exercise the power. I will make an order that the body of the summons be amended so that it reads, relevantly:
 
 
 
 "(b) to produce at the examination such books and records in your possession relating to the examinable affairs of the companies and limited to those books and records specified in terms of Schedule A. " 
 
 

 
(2) The examinee submitted that the only interlocutory process which may be issued in the proceeding (SAD 169 of 2009) is a process seeking relief which is sought for the purpose of advancing a claim made in the proceeding.</sentence>
