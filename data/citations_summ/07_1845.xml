<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 351">The applicants submitted that: Alternatively, corrective advertising may be ordered if it might ( Medical Benefits Fund v Cassidy [2003] FCAFC 289 ; (2003) 135 FCR 1 at 22 [54] ; Luxottica v Specsavers (No 2) [2010] FCA 644 at [9] ): 
 
 43.1 alert consumers to the fact of the misleading or deceptive conduct;
 43.2 inform consumers that they might have some remedy provided there is a nexus between the conduct and the order;
 43.3 aid the enforcement of a primary order; or
 43.4 prevent repetition of the conduct. 
 
 Corrective advertising may be ordered so as to address an applicant's "legitimate commercial concern about the impact of the advertisements and the fact that the impact may linger", even where several months have passed since the advertisements ( King Furniture [2007] FCA 1845 at [51] ---[52]). It is relevant to consider the nature and likely effect of the advertisement and of the proposed corrective advertising, the time which has elapsed, and the requirement that the corrective advertising not be disproportionate to the extent of publication of the misleading material ( Hoover (Aust) Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 511 ; (1991) 104 ALR 369 at 377 (Gummow J); Makita (Aust) Pty Ltd [1990] FCA 166 ; (1990) ATPR 41-030 , (1990) 18 IPR 270 at 281 (Wilcox J)). There is no principle that any particular period is appropriate as a point beyond which corrective advertising is not warranted. It is necessary to examine the nature, extent and intensity of the advertising and the media in which it has been released, with a view to deciding whether there could reasonably be any current misapprehension as a result of the advertisements ( Medical Benefits Fund v Cassidy (2003) 135 FCR 1 at 20 [49], quoting ACCC v On Clinic Australia Pty Ltd (1996) 135 IPR 635 at 640 (Tamberlin J)).
