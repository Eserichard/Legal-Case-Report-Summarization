<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 258">Section 46PO of the HREOC Act provided that the unlawful discrimination alleged in any application commenced in this Court must either be the same as the unlawful discrimination that was the subject of the terminated complaint or must arise out of the same acts, omissions or practices that were the subject of the terminated complaint. The Court has held that this provision prevents a complainant from relying, in a proceeding in the Court, on any act of unlawful discrimination which occurred after the relevant complaint had been lodged with the Commission: see Charles v Fuji Xerox Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1531 ; (2000) 105 FCR 573 at 580 (per Katz J); Maghiar v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 262 at [18] (per French J); Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [68] (per Weinberg J); Crvenkovic v Latrobe University [2009] FCA 374 at [11] (per Tracey J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 840">Principles --- extension of time 
 The relevant principles with respect to an extension of time have been set out by the Federal Court as follows: 47. Under s 46PO(2), it is clear that the Court has a discretion to grant an extension of time. The principles to be considered when deciding whether to extend time for the filing of an application were described by Weinberg J in the decision of Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at [21] to [24]. His Honour referred to the principles expounded by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-9, which related to an application for an extension of time under s 11 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("ADJR Act"), and held that the principles therein stated were applicable to s 46PO. I respectfully agree with Weinberg J that those principles are relevantly applicable to an application under the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 100">However, I bear in mind that I am determining this application at a time when the only documents filed by the applicant are the original application and the affidavit in support of the application for an extension of time, which has addressed the issue raised by the respondent in relation to whether s.15 or s. 17 of the Disability Discrimination Act was relied upon. At this stage having regard to all the circumstances I am not satisfied that the applicant does not have an arguable case. Further clarification of the precise nature of the applicant's claim, either by way of affidavit or by way of points of claim, is necessary, but I am not satisfied that in the particular circumstances of this case it would be futile to extend the time to enable him to pursue a hopeless case in the manner considered by Weinberg J in Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1073">As Deane J observed, the explanation required will depend on the circumstances of the case. In addition to the explanation for the delay, however, it has generally been accepted, in relation to a wide range of applications, that it is also necessary to consider the likelihood of prejudice to the respondent and whether the applicant for an extension of time has an arguable case: Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-349 per Wilcox J; Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [21] to [24] per Weinberg J; Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria (No 4) [2007] FCA 1449 ; (2007) 97 ALD 721 at [48] per Middleton J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 374">Charles has since been applied by other single judges: see Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [68] (per Weinberg J); Maghiar v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 262 at [18] (per French J); and Stanislawa Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1492 at [4] (per Tracey J). More recently a Full Court, in Hurst v State of Queensland [2006] FCAFC 100 ; (2006) 151 FCR 562 , accepted that s 46PO(3) imposed "temporal limits" on any claim brought under s 46PO(1). The Court was referred to Charles and its reasoning proceeded on the basis that Charles was correctly decided. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 336">Whether or not a Court should exercise its discretion to extend the time for making an application has been considered in numerous cases: see Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 per Wilcox J; Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [21] - [24] per Weinberg J; and SZGCA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 224 at [4] per Besanko J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCAFC 16"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1449">42 Justice Weinberg has usefully set out some other key aspects of the HREOC Act in the recent decision of Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [14] to [20]. I should note that Ms Bahonko submitted that the decision of Weinberg J should not be followed. However, leave to appeal from that decision was refused by Tracey J in Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1492 and in my respectful view, the statement of the relevant principles as set out by Weinberg J is correct. 63 The Minister referred to the decision of Weinberg J concerning a discrimination proceeding brought by Ms Bahonko against the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology ('RMIT') and others: see Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325. In that case, his Honour was similarly faced with an application for an extension of time, as Ms Bahonko had filed out of time, and an application for summary judgment made by one of the respondents. After his Honour considered the various claims, he refused to grant Ms Bahonko an extension of time, concluding in relation to the claims against RMIT as follows (at [86]):
 
 It would be quite wrong, in my view, to grant an extension of time in circumstances where there is a paucity of material to support claims of unlawful discrimination which are cast in sweeping, unparticularised and seemingly exaggerated terms. It is clear that the Commission acted correctly in terminating her complaints, having regard to the material that Ms Bahonko placed before it. The additional material placed before this Court in support of her application for review of the Commission's decision takes her case no further.  117 Further, and in any event, s 18A is confined to the acts of agents and employees which, as the Minister submitted, does not extend to the NBV, as the NBV is not an employee or agent of the Minister. True it is that the Minister appoints NBV members, but this does not make the Minister liable for actions of the NBV in relation to investigating professional conduct of nurses and imposing conditions on nurses' registrations: see also Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at 78. 47 Under s 46PO(2), it is clear that the Court has a discretion to grant an extension of time. The principles to be considered when deciding whether to extend time for the filing of an application were described by Weinberg J in the decision of Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at [21] to [24]. His Honour referred to the principles expounded by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-9, which related to an application for an extension of time under s 11 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act'), and held that the principles therein stated were applicable to s 46PO. I respectfully agree with Weinberg J that those principles are relevantly applicable to an application under the HREOC Act.  116 In any event, I accept the Minister's submissions that the Minister's role in relation to the NBV was limited, in the same way Weinberg J found the role of the Minister for Education and Training was limited in Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325. The Minister was not directly involved in the decisions and conduct of the NBV, but rather the NBV was constituted as a distinct and separate body under the Nurses Act and its decisions were its own.  50 However, it was always clear that the matter of the necessity for leave remained an issue. The way in which the proceeding has run its course has been a result of the number of interlocutory applications brought by all the parties which required consideration by the Court. No interlocutory application involved or proceeded on the basis that the issue of leave to file out of time was resolved in favour of Ms Bahonko. There can be no suggestion of waiver or abandonment by virtue of the conduct of the respondents to lead to the view that the extension of time issue need not be determined by me or that it did not remain a live issue for decision. Further, there is no basis to suggest that s 46PR is applicable to issues going to jurisdiction so as to permit me to consider the application for leave otherwise than in accordance with the principles set out above: see Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at [20] and [70]. Further, there can be no prejudice to Ms Bahonko, as the applications for summary dismissal, which were also before me, required consideration of the merits of the case, and therefore she was anticipating having to deal with the question of the merits of her complaints, and was given ample opportunity to do so.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] FCA 1492">1 The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a judgment of Weinberg J, given on 11 October 2006: see Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325. Leave is necessary because the judgment was interlocutory in nature: see Vranic v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) 67 ALD 798 , [2]. The application was brought out of time but no objection was raised to me considering the merits of the application as argued by Ms Bahonko. His Honour had refused an application, by Ms Bahonko, for an enlargement of time within which to file an application and claim pursuant to s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) ('the Act'). The decision which provided the catalyst for Ms Bahonko's application had been made under s 46PH(1)(c) of the Act. The President of the Commission had terminated a complaint made by her against the respondents because he considered that the complaints were 'trivial, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance'. By s 46PO(1) of the Act, a complainant, whose complaint is terminated by the President, may make an application to this Court alleging unlawful discrimination by one or more of the respondents to the complaint. Section 46PO(2) requires that any such application must be made within 28 days after the date of issue of the notice that the complaint has been terminated.</sentence>
