<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 541">In the present case, while there is significant variation as between the payment groups ($0.06 - $0.75), not only does this variation have a rational basis but it is also the case that no group member receives nothing from the settlement: cf Taylor v Telstra Corporation [2007] FCA 2008. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 537">The task of the Court is to determine whether the settlement is "fair and reasonable" . In Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2000) 180 ALR 459 , at [19] (p 465---466), Goldberg J explained that task in the following way: Ordinarily the task of a court upon an application such as this, is to determine whether the proposed settlement or compromise is fair and reasonable, having regard to the claims made on behalf of the group members who will be bound by the settlement. Ordinarily in such circumstances the court will take into account the amount offered to each group member, the prospects of success in the proceeding, the likelihood of the group members obtaining judgment for an amount significantly in excess of the settlement offer, the terms of any advice received from counsel and from any independent expert in relation to the issues which arise in the proceeding, the likely duration and cost of the proceeding if continued to judgment, and the attitude of the group members to the settlement. In Re General Motors Corp Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Products Liability Litigation [1995] USCA3 325 ; 55 F 3d 768 at 785 (1995) the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit referred to the nine-factor test it had adopted: 
 
 
 
 ... to help district courts structure their final decisions to approve settlements as fair, reasonable and adequate as required by Rule 23(e) [which requires court approval for settlement of class actions]. See Girsh v Jepson [1975] USCA3 523 ; 521 F 2d 153 at 157 (1975) (3rd Cir). Those factors are: (1) the complexity and duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the proceedings; (4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining a class action; (7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of the best recovery; and (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of all the attendant risks of litigation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (See also County of Suffolk v Long Island Lighting Co 907 F 2d 1295 at 1323 (1990) (2nd Cir), 5 Moore's Federal Practice , 3rd ed, p 23---348. ) This nine-factor test is equally helpful in the Australian jurisdiction and I find it a useful guide in considering the present proposed settlement.

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 277">And, in determining what is " fair and reasonable " it is to be recognised that there may well be few cases where there is only one outcome which can be so described: Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd [2006] FCA 1388, 236 ALR 322. Jessup J there thus observed: 
 
 [50] It is not, I consider, the court's function under s 33V of the Federal Court Act to second-guess the applicants' advisers as to the answer to the question whether the applicants ought to have accepted the respondents' offer; the court's function is, relevantly, confined to the question whether the settlement was fair and reasonable. There will rarely, if ever, be a case in which there is a unique outcome which should be regarded as the only fair and reasonable one. In settlement negotiations, some parties, and some advisers, tend to be more risk-averse than others. There is nothing unreasonable involved in either such position and, under s 33V, the court should, up to a point at least, take the applicants and their advisers as it finds them. Neither should the court consider that it knows more about the group members' businesses than the applicants, or more about the actual risks of the litigation than their advisers. So long as the agreed settlement falls within the range of fair and reasonable outcomes, taking everything into account, it should be regarded as qualifying for approval under s 33V.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1235">The applicants now seek the Court's approval pursuant to s 33V(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (the "Act") of the Terms of Settlement represented by the two Settlement Agreements. In considering that question, I have considered all of the affidavit material relied upon by the applicants in support of the sanction. I also considered the principles identified by Jacobson J in Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 2008 at [56] to [66]; the observations of Goldberg J in Williams v FAI Homes Security Pty Ltd (No. 4) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2001) 180 ALR 459 ; Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffmann-Laroche Ltd (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1388 ; (2007) 236 ALR 322 per Jessup J; and Vernon v Village Life Ltd [2009] FCA 516.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1189">As noted by Jacobson J in Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 2008 at [63] , Jessup J also said at [50] that he did not consider that it was the Court's function under s 33V to second guess the applicants' advisors in the answer to the question whether the applicants ought to have accepted the respondent's offer. The question is whether the agreed settlement falls within the range of a fair and reasonable outcome, taking everything into account. As Jessup J also pointed out in Darwalla , there is rarely, if ever, a case in which there is a unique outcome which should be regarded as the only fair and reasonable one. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 516">In Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 2008 at [56] to [66], I endeavoured to set out the principles which apply to the exercise of the power under s 33V to approve a settlement. The principles to which I referred were applied by Stone J in Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Limited [2009] FCA 19 at [10] . I will apply those principles in considering the present application. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 19">10 In Taylor v Telstra Corporation [2007] FCA 2008 at [56] - [66], Jacobson J provided a most useful survey of the authorities concerning s 33V which I set out below. Section 33V(1) of the Act provides that a representative proceeding may not be settled or discontinued without the approval of the Court. The purpose intended to be served by s 33V was stated succinctly by Branson J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 177 at 184.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 719">55 I do not consider that the course proposed by Mr Gageler falls within that which was adopted by Wilcox J in Telstra v Taylor . That matter was ultimately settled but I referred in my judgment approving the compromise to his Honour's order for discovery: Taylor v Telstra [2007] FCA 2008 at [11] .</sentence>
