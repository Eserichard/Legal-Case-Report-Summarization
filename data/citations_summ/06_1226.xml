<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 985">By application dated 18 November 2005 the applicant brought a Constitutional challenge in the Federal Court to the exercise of powers by a magistrate under the Extradition Act . On 12 September 2006, Siopis J dismissed the application: Zentai v Republic of Hungary [2006] FCA 1226 ; (2006) 153 FCR 104. An appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court was dismissed on 16 April 2007: Zentai v Republic of Hungary [2007] FCAFC 48 ; (2007) 157 FCR 585. The applicant was granted special leave to appeal, and the High Court ultimately dismissed the applicant's appeal on 23 April 2008: O'Donoghue v Ireland [2008] HCA 14 ; (2008) 234 CLR 599. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 691">On 12 September 2006, Siopis J dismissed the proceedings: see Zentai v Republic of Hungary [2006] FCA 1226 ; (2006) 153 FCR 104. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] HCA 14">The first two are appeals from decisions of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia (Moore, Tamberlin and Gyles JJ) [18] dismissing appeals from a judge of that Court (Siopis J) [19] . This is precisely what the primary judge and the Full Federal Court did, considering s 6(3)(b) to afford the requisite approval [155] . His Honour also accepted the submission that, in any event, "consent and approval" for the performance of the functions could be found in s 6(3)(b) of the Magistrates Court Act 2004 (WA) ("the WA Act ") [86] . Siopis J did not consider that there was such a need [85] . In the courts below [67] , that attempt was almost entirely confined to an endeavour to squeeze out of ambiguous and opaque State laws an indication that the relevant State Parliaments had indeed given their express approval for the deployment of State magistrates in the manner apparently contemplated by the federal law. This was the suggested need for State legislative approval of the imposition of federal "functions" on a "magistrate" of the State [84] . His Honour rejected two arguments then advanced for the appellants which have not been pursued in this Court [83] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCAFC 48">2 This is an appeal from reasons for judgment given by Siopsis J concerning two extradition applications raising the same issue: Zentai v Republic of Hungary [2006] FCA 1226. The Republic of Hungary is seeking the extradition of Mr Zentai in respect of an alleged war crime and the Republic of Ireland is seeking the extradition of Mr O'Donoghue in respect of charges of obtaining property by false pretences or, alternatively, fraudulent conversion. Each of the appellants has sought an order in the nature of prohibition restraining each of the second respondents from conducting proceedings to determine whether each appellant is eligible for surrender for extradition under s 19 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) ("the Act ").
