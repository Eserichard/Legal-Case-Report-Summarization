<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 812">The issue for the Tribunal to determine is whether the respondent is liable to pay compensation to Ms Brooks for an injury which has resulted in and continues to result in incapacity for work or impairment. The term injury is defined in s 4(1) of the Act in a manner which includes greater trochanteric bursitis if that condition arose out of, or in the course of, Ms Brooks' employment. While the initial acceptance was for greater trochanteric bursitis, the reviewable decision was made on the basis that liability was for a work-related aggravation of a constitutional condition which had ceased. Because of this, it was submitted by the parties that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to re-visit the condition as diagnosed in the original decision. [1] We accept the correctness of that submission. [2] Accordingly, if the evidence confirms that the original condition suffered by Ms Brooks was an aggravation of an underlying constitutional condition, the issue for the Tribunal is whether the incapacity referable to the aggravation has continued so that associated liability continues from 13 November 2009. 
  As we have indicated, although the initial acceptance was for greater trochanteric bursitis caused by Ms Brooks's employment, the reviewable decision was made on the basis that the accepted liability was for a work-related aggravation of a constitutional condition which had ceased. We accept the submission by the parties that we have jurisdiction to re-visit the original diagnosis of the condition. [34] We also accept that the evidence confirms that the original condition suffered by Ms Brooks was a work-related aggravation of an underlying constitutional condition and that the issue for the Tribunal is whether the incapacity referable to the aggravation has continued from 13 November 2009. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] AATA 153">In its reasons the Tribunal said: 
 "In my view Comcare treated Mr Buhr's complaint as if a formal claim had been lodged ...... Accordingly I consider that the continuing correspondence from Mr Buhr and Comcare's responses and medical investigation of Mr Buhr's claim should be treated as a claim and acceptance of that claim under the [SRC] Act. " [7] 
 
Edmonds J. in the Federal Court said:
 
 "I agree that the Tribunal's finding at [23] was open on the evidence and that, notwithstanding the lack of a formal claim for a delusional disorder, the requirements of s 54 were, on the facts of this case, substantially complied with by the applicant. " [8] 
 
This principle was stated also by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Telstra Corp Ltd v Barrow : (1994) 35 ALD 461. There is no prescribed form of notice of an injury: Frosch v Comcare [2004] FCA 1642. 
 
  In Buhr v Comcare [2007] FCA 575 the question was whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider a claim for compensation for a delusional/paranoid disorder claimed to have been contributed to by the applicant's employment. The Tribunal had found that the applicant had ceased to suffer from an adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression, the condition for which Comcare had accepted liability. The Tribunal had before it several medical reports which also were before Comcare. These reports referred to the applicant suffering a delusional disorder. </sentence>
