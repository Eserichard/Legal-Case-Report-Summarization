<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 908">Ms Naroth is concerned that the respondents' conduct will be productive of and result in delay and protraction of the proceedings if the Court agrees to further extend time for compliance with the filing of Court documents by the respondents. The respondents did, however, file, on 10 November 2010, a detailed points of defence and cross-claim running to some 10 pages and 83 paragraphs, which traverses, in various fashions, all of the allegations which are made in the points of claim. In parts it might lack particularisation, but that is not unusual in this Court, and in this Court it is not unusual for affidavits to be required to be filed to provide the required further particulars. [6] That approach, does not assist where there is also a failure to file the affidavits, and as already noted, the respondents in this case failed to file the affidavits ordered by the Court by the due date of 8 November 2010. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 479">The applicant will have made out her allegation of sex discrimination if she proves that the relevant conduct, namely her dismissal, amounted to treatment which was less favourable than a male would have received in circumstances which were the same or not materially different. It is necessary for the applicant to show that she was treated less favourably than a man would have been and that this was because of her sex: Purvis v New South Wales [2003] HCA 62 ; [2003] HCA 62 ; (2003) 217 CLR 92 ; Sterling Commerce (Australia) Pty Ltd v Iliff [2008] FCA 702 ; (2008) 173 IR 378. It will be sufficient if the relevant discriminatory characteristic, namely her sex, was "a reason" for the alleged conduct; it need not have been the "real reason" or the "only reason" for the conduct: Sterling Commerce v Iliff at 393 [48]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 457">As his Honour stated at [14], the general rules concerning pleadings should be considered having regard to the objects of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth) and Rules and modern case management techniques. Under s.3 of the Federal Magistrates Act the objects of this court are to enable it to " operate as informally as possible in the exercise of judicial power " and " to use streamline procedures " (see s.3). The criticisms levelled by the respondents at the latest Points of Claim must be considered in light of such observations (see McKellar at [32]) and the need to exercise the discretion with caution (see Buckingham v KSN Engineering Pty Ltd [2008] 177 IR 427 ; [2008] FMCA 546 , Rana v University of South Australia (2004) 136 FCR 344 ; [2004] FCA 559 , Sterling Commerce (Australia) Pty Ltd v Iliff (2008) 173 IR 378 ; [2008] FCA 702 and the discussion in Wylie v McCann at [29] --- [32]). As indicated above, the respondents' concern is with the pleading of agency between McCanns and Mr Brown and the basis of the claim that (by reason of such agency) McCanns is liable for the actions of Mr Brown that are said to constitute victimisation. Mr Newall raised cogent specific concerns about the conclusionary nature of those parts of the latest Points of Claim that referred to or relied on assertions of agency.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 746">In circumstances where there is: a serious and deliberate contravention, with consequences adverse to the employee affected by the contravention, and no evidence of contrition or of co-operation with regulatory authorities; a prior contravention for which a relatively substantial penalty was imposed and remains unpaid; conduct contrary to several objects of the WR Act , and a need for general and specific deterrence, 
the Court does not consider it appropriate that there be a penalty imposed at the minimum of the generally indicated range, that is 85% of the maximum available penalty. It is however nevertheless the case that, although serious, this is not the worst imaginable type of case, [41] and although there is a prior contravention record, this is only a second contravention. Having regard to all the factors set out above, and on an overall consideration of the circumstances, the Court considers that the penalty ought to be 90% of the maximum, that is $29,700. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FMCA 188">[45] There was no application to strike out the statement of claim which is remarkable for its lack of particularisation. In this Court it is not unusual to have to discern the particulars of a claim from the affidavit evidence (even when a statement of claim has been filed) and to do so is entirely consistent with the Parliamentary intention which was to establish a Court that was relatively inexpensive, able to provide expeditious justice, and which proceeds without undue formality so as to be sure that proceedings are not protracted. See O'Neill v Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd [2002] FCAFC 188 ; (2002) 122 FCR 455 at 462 per Carr, Moore and Marshall JJ; [2002] FCAFC 188 at para.16 per Carr, Moore and Marshall JJ; Rana v University of South Australia [2004] FCA 559 ; (2004) 136 FCR 344 at 349 per Lander J; [2004] FCA 559 at para.34 per Lander J; Sterling Commerce v Iliff (2008) 173 IR 378 at 387-388 per Gordon J; [2008] FCA 702 at paras.21-23 per Gordon J; Goodall v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 218 at para.21 per Lucev FM.
