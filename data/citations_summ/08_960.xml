<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 50">151 There are conflicting decisions in this Court and in the Industrial Relations Court as to whether an interlocutory application constitutes a "proceeding in a matter" within the meaning of s 824(1) and its predecessor. The authorities were reviewed by Young J in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534. His Honour's review demonstrates that the weight of authority favours the proposition that an interlocutory application, made by a party to a proceeding under the Act , is a proceeding in a matter for the purposes of s 824(1): see, particularly, Shackley v Australian Croatian Club Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 736 ; Commonwealth v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2003] FCAFC 115 ; (2003) 129 FCR 271. See also Sydney Ferries Corporation v Australian Maritime Officers Union (No 3) [2008] FCA 960 at [6] . None of these cases, however, involved an interlocutory application by a person who was not a party to the proceeding at the time at which the application was made. They do not, therefore, provide direct assistance in resolving the present issue. 77 The joint judgment notes, in [151]:
 
 
 151 ... The authorities were reviewed by Young J in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534. His Honour's review demonstrates that the weight of authority favours the proposition that an interlocutory application, made by a party to a proceeding under the Act, is a proceeding in a matter for the purposes of s 824(1): see, particularly, Shackley v Australian Croatian Club Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 736 ; Commonwealth v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2003] FCAFC 115 ; (2003) 129 FCR 271. See also Sydney Ferries Corporation v Australian Maritime Officers Union (No 3) [2008] FCA 960 at [6] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 193">2 The judgments from which the present appeal is brought ( Sydney Ferries Corporation v Australian Maritime Officers Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 954 and Sydney Ferries Corporation v Australian Maritime Officers Union (No 3) [2008] FCA 960) dealt, respectively, with a claim for a declaration sought by SFC about the meaning of certain provisions in the 2006 Agreement and the costs of an anti-suit injunction. 32 This ground of appeal proceeds upon a misconception about the operation of s 824(2) of the Act. As the trial judge pointed out, the unreasonable act or omission referred to in s 824(2) is not confined to such an act or omission occurring within the proceedings themselves: [2008] FCA 960 at [21] - [22]. It is enough if the unreasonable act or omission caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding. There is no doubt that AMOU incurred costs in connection with its application to restrain SFC. That application was prompted by SFC's act in commencing proceedings in the AIRC. </sentence>
