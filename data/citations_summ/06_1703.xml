<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 227">Mr Karp, for the Applicant, referred to Mrs Glanville's evidence (at paragraphs 3 and 4 of her statement dated 15 December 2010, quoted above) about her husband's wartime experiences on islands in the Pacific and about his enjoyment of certain (fatty) foods after the war. Mr Karp noted the decision in Repatriation Commission v Dunn (2006) 94 ALD 97 ; [2006] FCA 1703 ( Dunn ), at 111, where Nicholson J, in a similar case involving malignant neoplasm of the prostate, said that a hypothesis could not be raised as reasonable unless there was some material pointing to the connection between the relevant post-operational service consumption and the circumstances of the veteran's service. Mr Karp submitted that in the present case, there is material pointing to each element of the SoP. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 637">It appears that there is an important qualification to what was said in Byrnes case regarding the assumption of the occurrence or existence of a fact. The Court in that case said such an assumption did not make the hypothesis unreasonable. However, as Nicholson J said in Repatriation Commission v Dunn [2006] FCA 1703 at [46] : If there is an assumed fact it cannot be the fact to which the hypothesis must be addressed; that is, the fact of connection. Applying that statement to the matter before us, it seems that if we were to find that Mr Farley-Smith was exposed to benzene in the course of his military service, it cannot be assumed that the exposure resulted in Mr Farley-Smith developing myelofibrosis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 759">The Repatriation Commission referred us to the judgment of the Federal Court in Dunn v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 1703. This judgment, it was submitted, stands for the proposition that without material pointing to the connection between hypothesised events and the veteran's service, there can be no reasonable hypothesis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 1078">However, the Commission also relied on the decision of Ryan J in Dunn v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 1703 . In relation to circumstances very similar to those in the present case, His Honour said: 
 "In my view the Commission is correct in maintaining that there was not material before the Tribunal which pointed to the continuance of Mr Dunn's diet for a period of 20 years as being related to his operational service. The only way that relationship could have been open and found would have been by inference that it would not have occurred but for the rendering of the service by him --- s 196B(14)(f) --- or otherwise fell within other paragraphs of that section. It cannot be concluded that the inference was logically the only conclusion open from the other circumstances in the material. " 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 521">10 The Tribunal held that, according to authority ( Repatriation Commission v Hill [2002] FCAFC 192 ; (2002) 69 ALD 581) "a hypothesis relied on by a veteran to support a pension claim must be supported by material pointing to each element that the SoP makes essential for the hypothesis to be reasonable". Further, the Tribunal held that material which supports the hypothesis of the connection must exist, citing Repatriation Commission v Dunn [2006] FCA 1703 ; (2006) 94 ALD 97 per Nicholson J at [46].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCAFC 2">Some of these cases refer to s 51A(2) as reversing the persuasive onus: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IMB Group Pty Limited (1999) ATPR 41-704 at [13]; Blacker v National Australia Bank [2000] FCA 681 at [83] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Henry Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 at [133] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Emerald Ocean [2006] FCA 1703 and Lewarne [2007] FCA 1136 . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] AATA 1996"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] AATA 1871">We acknowledge and agree with the dicta of Heerey J in Blair v Repatriation Commission [2005] FCA 1076 at [25] that it is impermissible merely to assume or assert the facts which are said to found the hypothesis. We also have noted the observation of Nicholson J in Repatriation Commission v Dunn [2006] FCA 1703: 
 
 As was the case in Byrnes at 569, the hypothesis is one of connection of the veteran's condition with the circumstances of his service. If there is an assumed fact it cannot be the fact to which the hypothesis must be addressed; that is, the fact of connection. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] AATA 1416">The material which supports the hypothesis of the connection with service must exist. In Repatriation Commission v Dunn [2006] FCA 1703 , Nicholson J at paragraph 46 said: 
 "It is necessary to return to the precise words of 5(c) of the SoP. The opening words state the factors which must as a minimum exist before it can be said a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting the malignant prostate with the circumstances of the person's death. The three circumstances in (c) have been set out above.</sentence>
