<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1589">The applicant sought review by the Tribunal. He attended a hearing. The Tribunal as originally constituted (T 1 ) affirmed the decision of the delegate of the first respondent on 31 May 1999. The applicant sought judicial review on 8 October 2004. On 13 March 2006 Graham J of the Federal Court of Australia (on appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court) made orders quashing the Tribunal decision and remitting the matter for reconsideration (see S1983 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 209). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 99">Emmett J refused to grant orders nisi , for reasons which his Honour published in relation to 707 other such applications (see Applicant S1174 of 2000 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 289). The applicant then commenced fresh proceedings in this Court. The applicant was unsuccessful at first instance, but on appeal Graham J ordered the issue of writs quashing the first Tribunal's decision (see S1983 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 209). The matter was then remitted to the Tribunal, and has now produced the present decision which is before me. 3.</sentence>
