<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1204">In Melaleuca her Honour examined a number of factors referred to by the Court of Appeal in Damjanovic in the exercise of her discretion on whether to grant the appropriate leave. She found there was no material before her to warrant the grant of leave. Bennett J applied the same reasoning in SZFCX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 394 to ground a grant of leave. Factors found there to support the grant of leave were the complexity of the case, genuine difficulties experienced by the appellant in representing himself and the ability of the lay advocate to present the case better and more efficiently. Stone J in ' Pooncarie' Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v NSW Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation [2006] FCA 25 concluded that the applicant for leave there had neither the discipline nor understanding to assist the persons he would represent or the Court so that the grant of leave should be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 246">29 A Court "has an inherent right in regulating its own proceedings to allow a person, not being a party or a party's lawyer, to conduct a case on behalf of a party where it is desirable to do so in the interests of the administration of justice": Melaleuca of Australia &amp; New Zealand Pty Ltd v Duck [2005] FCA 1481 at [14] per Bennett J. Mr Laba Sarkis has been granted permission to advocate the interests of parties in other proceedings: SZFCX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 394 at [16] , 90 ALD 634 at 646---7; Sam v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1976 at [6] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1976">6 In addition a community volunteer, Mr Laba-Sarkis JP, sought the indulgence of the Court to make submissions on the Appellant's behalf. That course was not opposed by counsel for the First Respondent. A like indulgence was extended in SZFCX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 394 at [16] , 90 ALD 634 at 646---6. Mr Laba-Sarkis essentially made two submissions:
 
(a) that the Court should exercise compassion towards the Appellant; and
 
(b) that it was sufficient for the First Appellant to satisfy cl 457.223(4)(a). The latter submission was that the status of the sponsor, as at the date of the decision, was irrelevant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 344">Similarly, in SZFCX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 394 Bennett J found for the applicant in a case where the Tribunal concluded that an applicant was not at risk as a result of being a member of General Aoun's army (as those soldiers were being included in the LAF), because the Tribunal failed to consider the additional aspect of the applicant's claim that he had joined General Aoun's army on deserting from the LAF: 28.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 1638">In Melaleuca her Honour examined a number of factors referred to by the Court of Appeal in Damjanovic in the exercise of her discretion on whether to grant the appropriate leave. She found there was no material before her to warrant the grant of leave. Bennett J applied the same reasoning in SZFCX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 394 to ground a grant of leave.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FMCA 1280">After the hearing Mr Laba-Sarkis drew the Court's attention to the decision in SZFCX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 394 , suggesting that it related to a Tribunal decision of 1997 and that as Bennett J had found that there was a jurisdictional error the appellant did not have to establish unwarrantable delay [sic].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] FCA 974">In resisted the making of a costs order against him, Mr Laba-Sarkis referred to the reasons of Bennett J in SZFCX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 394 , although he did not identify the basis for his reliance. In that case, Mr Laba-Sarkis was granted leave to speak on behalf of an appellant who successfully appealed from a decision of a Federal Magistrate dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Tribunal. In granting leave for Mr Laba-Sakis to speak on the appellant's behalf, her Honour said at [16]: 
 
 "A court has an inherent right in regulating its own proceedings to allow a person, not being a party or a party&#180;s lawyer, to conduct a case on behalf of a party where it is desirable to do so in the interests of the administration of justice. However such an application is not granted as a matter of course; Melaleuca of Australia &amp; New Zealand Pty Ltd v Duck [2005] FCA 1481. While there are no disciplinary measures available for any lay advocates, in this case it was relevant that the case was complex, the appellant had genuine difficulties in representing himself. Mr Laba-Sarkis was familiar with the matter and I was of the view that Mr Laba-Sarkis would be able to present the case better and more efficiently than the appellant could. In these unusual circumstances, I was satisfied that Mr Laba-Sarkis would be of assistance to the appellant and to the Court and to the efficiency of the hearing. I granted leave for Mr Laba-Sarkis to speak on behalf of the appellant. "
