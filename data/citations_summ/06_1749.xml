<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 233">A decision was made by the Tribunal as originally constituted, which was handed down on 19 May 2005 and affirmed the delegate's decision. That decision was quashed by order of Dowsett J, on appeal in the Federal Court (see SZGLT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1749). His Honour's reasons are found in the following paragraphs of his judgment: 24 In the course of the hearing of this appeal I became concerned that the Tribunal may not have fully understood the ambit of the appellant's claim, in particular that she claimed to fear economic persecution as well as physical violence, and that such fear was of persecution for political belief (her opposition to extortion) and, arguably, for membership of a social group (those who could pay and/or had spoken out against extortion). Of course, in any case based on economic persecution it would be necessary to show that the relevant extortion was likely to threaten the capacity of the appellant and her family to subsist.</sentence>
