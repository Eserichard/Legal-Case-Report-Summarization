<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 498">It is now well established that in determining whether to make an order for the winding up of a company on the just and equitable ground, the Court must itself evaluate the factual matrix in order to form a view as to whether a sufficient reason for making the order is demonstrated: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Green Pacific Energy Ltd [2006] FCA 1254 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 142 at 181 [139] .  In the past, orders under s 461(1)(k) of the Act have included cases: where, on application by a public authority, it is in the public interest that a company be wound up because there is a 'justifiable lack of confidence in the conduct and management of the affairs of the company': Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Green Pacific Energy Ltd [2006] FCA 1254 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 142 at 181 [137] to [139]; where the winding up will serve to protect investors: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus [2002] NSWSC 310 ; (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at 579 [96] to [98]; and the affairs of the company have been conducted in a way which demonstrates a lack of probity productive of a justifiable lack of confidence in the administration of the company, or where there has been misconduct or illegality in the conduct of the affairs such as it is in the public interest in the protection of investors that the company be wound up: Loch v John Blackwood Ltd [1924] AC 283 at 788; Australian Securities Commission v AS Nominees Pty Ltd (1995) 62 FCR 503 at 530-533; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v ABC Fund Managers Ltd [2001] VSC 383 ; (2001) 39 ACSR 443 at [116] --- [129]; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Casualife Furniture International Pty Ltd [2004] VSC 157 ; (2004) 9 VR 549 at [449] --- [464]; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v International Unity Insurance Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1059 at [135] --- [139]; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v West (2008) 66 ACSR 143 at [140] --- [160]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 2084">7 ASIC should identify the public interest on which it bases its application to wind up for just and equitable reasons: Australian Securities Commission v AS Nominees Ltd [1995] FCA 1663 ; (1995) 133 ALR 1 and more recently in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Green Pacific Energy Ltd [2006] FCA 1254 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 142 per Greenwood J at [138]-[144]. The plaintiff points to the continued breaches of the Act as the public interest affected by the operations of the defendant through its management. The plaintiff also submits that the public interests requires that corporations have effective management so that creditors of the corporation are dealt with in accordance with the statutory duties of both the corporation and its directors. Winding up is the appropriate remedy to end a period of managerial limbo: Clarke v Bridges [2004] FCA 394 per Finkelstein J at [7] to [13].
