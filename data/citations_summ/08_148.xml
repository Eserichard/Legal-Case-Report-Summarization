<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1439">2 There was a hearing on 18 February 2008 of various motions and that led to a judgment being given on 27 February 2008: see Glueck v Stang and Others [2008] FCA 148. Order 6 made on 27 February 2008 was that Mr Glueck pay the costs of the first, second, third and fifth respondents of the three motions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1148">Although the specific terms of the matters before the WAIRC and Centrelink are not set out in the Applicant's First Affidavit, and no mention has been made of the relevant legislation in relation to those matters, it cannot but be the case that those matters related to remedies being sought by the Applicant under the relevant legislation governing those statutory bodies. As such any representations made by the Respondent were made in relation to legislative remedies being pursued by the Applicant. Whilst the alleged representations might have been made in the course of trade or commerce in a very general or broad sense (that is, a non s.52 sense) they were not conduct or representations bearing a trading or commercial character. For that reason they were not made "in trade or commerce". [51] Conclusion --- in trade or commerce

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1283">12 In Glueck v Stang [2008] FCA 148 ; (2008) 76 IPR 75 the applicant alleged that Novopharm, in trade or commerce, engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to an application to the Australian Patent Office for the grant of letters patent. At [32] to [33] Lindgren J said:
 The course of authority outlined above requires me to hold that the alleged representations by Novopharm to the APO ... were not made in trade or commerce. They were not made in the course of a trading or commercial relationship between Novopharm on the one hand, and ... the APO ... on the other hand. Novopharm had no trading or commercial dealings with the APO .... Nor were they made in the course of the negotiation of contracts .... The alleged representations were made to a government instrumentality pursuant to legislation for the purpose of obtaining an exclusive right or bundle of rights made available by that legislation. No doubt the alleged representations were made by Novopharm in trade or commerce in a broad non-s 52 sense. However, in Concrete Constructions the High Court ... rejected the view that the expression 'in trade or commerce' in s 52 referred to the 'immense field of activities' in which corporations may engage in the course of, or for the purposes of, carrying on some overall trading or commercial business .... </sentence>
