<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 272">11 Justice Branson found there was no arguable case for the issue of an order nisi (see Applicant S202/2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 1714). Her Honour found that there was no evidence to support the applicant's claim that the Tribunal failed to consider all material relating to his application for a protection visa. Her Honour also found that the applicant's assertion that he was denied procedural fairness, because as a consequence of the hearing invitation letter he was misled into thinking the Tribunal had the material to consider in relation to his claim and he therefore did not provide other documents, was unfounded. Justice Branson observed that the applicant failed to identify material which he would have brought to the attention of the Tribunal had he not received the hearing invitation. Similarly, her Honour noted that the applicant did not suggest that the substantive content of independent country information the Tribunal used in reaching its decision was not drawn to his attention during the hearing.</sentence>
