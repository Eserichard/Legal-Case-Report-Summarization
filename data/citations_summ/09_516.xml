<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 277">Although s 33V(1) itself imposes no express constraint on the manner in which the Court may either grant of refuse approval, it has repeatedly been said that the task of the Court is to determine whether a proposed settlement is " fair and reasonable ". Thus, by way of example, in Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4) [2000] FCA 1925 , 180 ALR 459 , Goldberg J observed: 
 
 [19] Ordinarily the task of a court upon an application such as this, is to determine whether the proposed settlement or compromise is fair and reasonable, having regard to the claims made on behalf of the group members who will be bound by the settlement. Ordinarily in such circumstances the Court will take into account the amount offered to each group member, the prospects of success in the proceeding, the likelihood of the group members obtaining judgment for an amount significantly in excess of the settlement offer, the terms of any advice received from counsel and from any independent expert in relation to the issues which arise in the proceeding, the likely duration and cost of the proceeding if continued to judgment, and the attitude of the group members to the settlement.

Section 33V(1), it will be noted, applies to both the settlement or discontinuance of a representative proceeding and leave to discontinue will not be granted where it is not " fair and reasonable " to do so: eg, Mercedes Holdings Pty Ltd v Waters (No 1) [2010] FCA 124 , 77 ACSR 265 per Perram J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 749">The opt-out requirements of Part IVA are " an important element of the scheme laid down by that part of the Act ": Vernon v Village Life Ltd [2009] FCA 516 at [59] per Jacobson J. The ability to opt out of a representative proceeding assumes particular relevance because the consent of a person to be a group member is not required, except in specified circumstances not of present relevance: s 33E. See also: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Limited (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 252 per Branson J; Guglielmin v Trescowthick (No 2) [2005] FCA 138 at [14] , [2005] FCA 138 ; 220 ALR 515 at 519 per Mansfield J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1235">I also considered the principles identified by Jacobson J in Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 2008 at [56] to [66]; the observations of Goldberg J in Williams v FAI Homes Security Pty Ltd (No. 4) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2001) 180 ALR 459 ; Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffmann-Laroche Ltd (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1388 ; (2007) 236 ALR 322 per Jessup J; and Vernon v Village Life Ltd [2009] FCA 516. The nine factor test described by Goldberg J in Williams v FAI Homes Security Pty Ltd (No. 4) as "helpful in the Australian jurisdiction" derives from a nine factor test adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the third circuit in Re General Motors Corp Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Products Liability Litigation [1995] USCA3 325 ; 55 F 3d 768 at 785.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 758">The Court has an important responsibility of safeguarding the interest of group members as a whole under s 33V(1). There is a danger that when a settlement is reached or a discontinuance is agreed, the interests of the actual parties to the proceedings may receive their paramount consideration while the impact on group members may not be fully or properly addressed. That is why in exercising the power under s 33V(1) to approve a settlement or discontinuance the Court must scrutinise with great care the way in which any order is formulated. In the decided cases the Courts have approached settlements with a keen eye to ensuring that the interests of group members are vouched safe: see eg Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258B-C per Branson J; McMullin v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd (1998) 84 FCR 1 at 3C-E per Wilcox J; Courtney 122 FCR at 181 [45] per Sackville J and Vernon v Village Life Ltd [2009] FCA 516 at [64] - [68] per Jacobson J. </sentence>
