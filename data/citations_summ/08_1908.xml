<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 806">Having identified the matters the Tribunal had to consider under ss 342(1)(c) and 340 of the Act, it is necessary next to consider whether it did duly consider those matters, or at least such of them as were necessary to properly undertake its review of ASIC's decision. Obviously, this requires an examination of the Tribunal's reasons for decision. That examination must take into account the admonitions in various authorities that this Court should not be concerned with loose language, infelicitous expression, nor approach the construction of those reasons: " minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error ": see Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 456 ; (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287 per Neaves, French and Cooper JJ, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 (" Wu Shan Liang ") at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ, TelePacific Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 218 ALR 85 ; [2005] FCA 158 at [55] per Sackville J and Young v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (2010) 111 ALD 345 ; [2008] FCA 1908 at [83] per Gilmour J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 743">The lack of compliance was not articulated with any great precision or clarity. It was said that the grounds in the amended draft notice of appeal 'are little more than a duplication of the alleged question of law'. Grounds 4(a) to 4(j) differ only from the corresponding alleged questions of law in two ways: first, the word 'whether' is omitted from the opening words so that each paragraph is no longer prefaced as a question and; second, statutory references are inserted. But as the Commissioner acknowledges in his referral to various quotations from cases such as Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at [47] (Branson J); Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 523 (Ryan J); Young v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1908 at [19] (Gilmour J); Price Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 154 ; (2007) 243 ALR 728 at [75] (Greenwood J); and Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 38 AAR 55 at [18] (Branson and Stone JJ), because the existence of a question of law is not merely a qualifying condition to ground the appeal, but must be the subject matter of the appeal itself --- see TNT Skypak International (Aust. ) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178 (Gummow J) --- there should be a link or symmetry between the question raised and the ground relied upon. Subject to the question raised being truly a pure question of law (see Birdseye at [18] (Branson and Stone JJ)), the applicant's articulation of the grounds in the manner assailed by the Commissioner may well provide the necessary link or symmetry. I would not exercise my discretion to refuse to extend time on the basis that the amended draft notice of appeal does not comply with 0 53 r 3(2)(d). </sentence>
