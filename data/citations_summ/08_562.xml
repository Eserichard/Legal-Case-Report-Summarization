<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] WASC 136">14 On an application to strike out, it is now also necessary to consider the role of pleadings in the context of case management techniques, including the pre-trial exchange of witness statements: although see Wainter Pty Ltd v Freehills (a firm) [2008] FCA 562 [4] (French J). The court will seriously entertain criticisms of a pleading only where the defects complained of may significantly affect the proper preparation of the case and its presentation at trial: Barclay Mowlem Construction Ltd v Dampier Port Authority [2006] WASC 281 ; (2006) 33 WAR 82 [8]. Providing a pleading fulfils its basic function by identifying the issues, disclosing an arguable cause of action, and apprising the other party of the case it has to meet at trial, then the action should proceed: Murchison Zinc Co Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd [2000] WASCA 167 [38]; Barclay Mowlem Construction Ltd [5] - [9]. </sentence>
