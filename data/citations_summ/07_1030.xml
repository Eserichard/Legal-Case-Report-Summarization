<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 494">Although his Honour spoke of the public interest, it is clear from the comment that the public interest he identified concerned prejudice to the administration of justice; see also Elderslie Finance Corporation Ltd v Newpage Pty Ltd (No 6) [2007] FCA 1030 ; (2007) 160 FCR 423 at [43] . In the first judgment I stated at [22], that the "details of the proposed proceedings and the assumptions that Mr Williams was asked to make in preparing his expert report all have the potential to compromise the proposed proceedings if disclosed". I remain of that opinion. Moreover, the potential for prejudice would be greater in the case of disclosure to Fortress. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 1115">6 There has been no definitive analysis of the expression "debt to the company" appearing in s 477(2A). Barrett J looked at the matter in QBE Workers' Compensation (NSW) Pty Ltd v GJ Formwork Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 98 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 687. Lindgren J considered it, in more detail, in Elderslie Finance Corporation Ltd v Newpage Pty Ltd (No. 6) [2007] FCA 1030 ; (2007) 160 FCR 423. In the former case, Barrett J pointed out at 588[4] that there was "a threshold question whether s 477(2A) applies, in that it is concerned only with the compromise of a debt". His Honour said that, in case of doubt, the Court should err on the side of granting approval under s 477(2A). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWSC 1350">75 For reasons already discussed, Company X no longer holds a debt owed by Company Y. No question of compromise of a debt therefore arises, with the result that there is no occasion for an approving order to be made under s 477(2A). The section is concerned with debts strictly so called: see, for example, Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 7) [2006] FCA 1177 ; Elderslie Finance Corporation Ltd v Newpage Pty Ltd (No 6) [2007] FCA 1030 ; (2007) 160 FCR 423. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1212">The Court may approve a compromise if one of a number of ways of presenting a claim involves a "debt" claim: Elderslie Finance Corporation Ltd v Newpage (No 6) [2007] FCA 1030 ; (2007) 160 FCR 423 at [40] - [41]. </sentence>
