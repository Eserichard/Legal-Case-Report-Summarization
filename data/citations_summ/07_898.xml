<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 774">In relation to the absence of material relating to the years immediately after the veteran's service, the Act provides that account is to be taken of difficulties that lie in the way of ascertaining the existence of any fact, matter, cause or circumstance including any reason attributable the effects of the passage of time [8] . However, the beneficial nature of that provision does not enable a decision-maker to reach a finding not supported by the evidence [9] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 710">Mr Orr's submissions concerning section 119 of the Act do not take the matter further. While inferences arising from the evidence cannot be ignored, the beneficial nature of the Act and section 119 cannot be used to plug evidentiary gaps in a veteran's case. [49] </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1126">1 On 13 June 2007, the Court delivered judgment ( Jakab v Repatriation Commission [2007] FCA 898) in an application by Mr Stefan Jakab pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act') by way of an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('AAT') affirming a decision of the Repatriation Commission that Mr Jakab's Meniere's Disease diagnosed in 1995 was not related to his period of eligible defence service. Mr Jakab was unsuccessful in that application. The application was dismissed. The costs of and incidental to the application were reserved.
