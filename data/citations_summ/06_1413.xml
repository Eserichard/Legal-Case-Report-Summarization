<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1203">In The Church of Scientology Inc v Woodward [1982] HCA 78 ; (1982) 154 CLR 25 at 55 (" Church of Scientology ") a submission that had earlier been made was " disavowed " and later expressed in " less ambitious " terms. The earlier submission had been that each of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Acts of 1956 and 1979 " evinces a legislative intent to shield the conduct of ASIO from judicial review ". In disavowing that submission, it was later " conceded that decisions made and acts done corruptly or mala fides were open to such review ". See also: Parkin v O'Sullivan [2006] FCA 1413 at [17] , [2006] FCA 1413 ; 162 FCR 444 at 448 per Sundberg J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1096">A description of these two related applications and relevant background material can be found in my earlier reasons in Parkin v O'Sullivan [2006] FCA 1413. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 1035">Section 375A deals only with the question of the release by the Tribunal of information disclosed to the Tribunal to persons other than those of the Tribunal. It regulates the authority of the Tribunal to disclose the information by prohibiting disclosure to persons (other than members) in respect of material the subject of the certificate. It does not purport to deal with the release of information in the context of proceedings in a forum other than the Tribunal or to deal in a general way with questions relating to the dissemination of the material. In that sense the position of this Court is the same as that of the Federal Court in Parkin and O'Sullivan [2006] FCA 1413 in dealing with an application for an order for discovery of an adverse security assessment of individuals under the Australian Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth) . In that case Sundberg J noted at [31]: It is clear that the ASIO Act does not, on its face, prohibit a Court from ordering discovery of an adverse security assessment. The Director General, however, says that the intention of the Act is to preclude a non-citizen who is the subject of an adverse security assessment from receiving a copy of the assessment or the material relied on in preparing it, or from having that assessment reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This, he submits, should be taken into account in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion to order discovery.
