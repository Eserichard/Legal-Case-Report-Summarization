<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 224">Mr Cleary of counsel who appeared for the Minister submitted that the grounds in the amended application did not disclose jurisdictional error. In particular he submitted that a failure to comply with s.424AA of the Act does not constitute jurisdictional error and referred the Court to the Full Court appellate decision of SZLWI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [7] particularly at [19] where his Honour Gilmour J referred to the operation of s.424AA and spoke with approval of the decision of this Court in SZMCD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [8] at [56] and other paragraphs. I was also referred to the decisions of SZLML v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [9] , SZMAE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [10] and SZITH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [11] on that same point. Further, it was submitted that even though there was no obligation, nor can there be, to comply with s.424AA of the Migration Act , the Tribunal did in fact do so as appears from the decision record. </sentence>
