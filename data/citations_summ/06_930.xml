<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1413">Pursuant to O 62 r 4(2)(c) the Court may order that, instead of taxed costs, costs be awarded as a gross sum. The purpose of the order is to "save the parties the time, trouble, delay, expense and aggravation in having a taxation proceed on a matter": Keen v Telstra Corp Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 930 at [4]; Nine Films &amp; Television Pty Limited v Ninox Television Limited [2006] FCA 1046 ; Macquarie Bank Ltd v Seagle (2008) 79 IPR 72 ; [2008] FCA 1417 at [30] . The power is not confined and may be exercised whenever the circumstances warrant its exercise: Su v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (No 3) [2008] FCA 2018 at [1] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] SAWCT 53">However, it does not follow that what is required is a detailed analysis of each item claimed. The practice of the Supreme Court permits the fixing of a lump sum in lieu of adjudicated costs. This practice is invoked to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation arising out of taxation. [2] Although it is usually reserved for more complex cases, there is no reason in principle why it should be limited to such cases. [3] Given the limited amount of costs that can be awarded in a case such as this and given the potential for a protracted argument about costs to assume a disproportionate amount of time relative to that maximum, there is every reason to think that such an approach would be routinely applied. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 391">Finally, the Amended Notice of Motion seeks costs, by way of a fixed costs order, in the sum of $23,253.00. As was noted by Rares J in Keen v Telstra Corporation Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 930 , a fixed costs order pursuant to Or 62 r 42(c) will save the parties time, trouble, delay and expense, and aggravation in having a taxation of costs proceeding. The applicant has filed an affidavit deposing to an assessment of costs from Hickey and Garrett legal costs consultants. I am satisfied from that material that a fixed costs order in the sum sought by the prayer for relief numbered 4 in the Amended Notice of Motion is appropriate. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 701">It has been said that the purpose of making an order for gross sum costs is to " save the parties the time, trouble, delay, expense and aggravation in having a taxation proceed on a matter " [1] . Whilst it has also been said that the power to award gross sum costs is appropriate to be used in complex cases [2] it has also been said that there is nonetheless "... no particular characteristic of a case which must exist before a gross sum costs order can be made " [3] . I note also the statement by Conti J that the power to award gross sum costs can be used " to avoid an ongoing counter productive dispute (as to costs), in the interests of achieving finality, subject always to the need to ensure that unreasonable amounts of costs are not pursued and awarded " [4] . These comments have particular application in this case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] QSC 9">In Keen v Telstra Corporation Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 930 an applicant for judicial review who had been successful before the Federal Court in the review of a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal obtained a fixed costs order.</sentence>
