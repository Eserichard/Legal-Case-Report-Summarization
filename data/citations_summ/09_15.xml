<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 785">Incidentally, there have been separate issues as to whether the documents on both files to which O 46 r 6(1) and (2) of the Federal Court Rules applies should be available for inspection by any member of the public. I ruled on that issue: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Nicholls [2009] FCA 122 and Nicholls v Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2009] FCA 123. I also ruled on an application by Mr Nicholls that certain documents be ordered to be confidential, pursuant to s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). I refused to make such an order: Nicholls v Australian Federal Police (No 3) [2009] FCA 152.  Mr Nicholls challenged the validity of certain decisions concerning its grant and execution under various provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth). His application was dismissed: Nicholls v Australian Federal Police [2009] FCA 15 (the first proceeding). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 152">The respondents objected to the competency of the proceeding, and complained about the applicant's persistent failure to comply with orders of the Court directed at progressing the matter. On the hearing of those issues, the applicant through counsel read a number of affidavits which had been filed. On 15 January 2009, I dismissed the proceeding: Nicholls v Australian Federal Police [2009] FCA 15. </sentence>

I accept that the release of the banking information that had been obtained by the ATO through the use of its s65 coercive notices was authorised by virtue, at least, of s3E of the TAA.
