<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 345">In this case, the Prime Minister has no formal role, constitutionally, legislatively or otherwise. There is no evidence that the Prime Minister has had any involvement in the migration decision that Mr O'Donoghue seeks to have this Court review. No breach of statutory duty by the Prime Minister is suggested or apparent in the material before the Court. [84] Nor could there be: the Prime Minister has no power to grant or refuse a visa. [85] Therefore, no remedy can issue against the Prime Minister. Additionally, the bases upon which Mr O'Donoghue has sought to support his application to join the Prime Minister as a party to this matter lack any legal justification. The Prime Minister's public views about the trial of Australian citizens in China and the responsibility of the Minister for Environment in relation to the home insulation matter are not reflective of any constitutional or legal responsibility for the matters adverted to by Mr O'Donoghue in support of this part of his Interim Application. </sentence>
