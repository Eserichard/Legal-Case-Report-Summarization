 As a creditor, the Crown should provide assistance and information to a liquidator, so that the liquidator can determine whether to bring his own proceedings, before the government agency seeks leave to proceed in his place ( Commissioner for Revenue (ACT) v Slaven (2009) FCA 744 at [22] - [25] per Rares J). </sentence>
