<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 352">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dukemaster Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 682 considered s 53 of the TPA. The requirement that the representation be false or misleading was considered at paragraphs [14] and [15] as follows: 
 
 
 In relation to the first element, s 53(e ) requires the representation to be "false or misleading" as opposed to "misleading or deceptive" (in s 52). I was not taken to, and I have not found, any authority which attributes a meaningful difference to this dichotomy for the purposes of the TPA. (For a discussion of the phrase "false and misleading" under a different Act, see Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Hadkiss (2007) 160 FCR 151). Indeed, the vast majority of cases that discuss an alleged breach of s 53(e) couple it with a breach of s 52 and deal with the "false or misleading" and "misleading or deceptive" aspect of the conduct mutatis mutandis: see Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1613 ; (2005) 214 ALR 554 at [94] ; ACCC v Target Australia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1326 ; (2001) ATPR 41-840 ; ACCC v Harbin Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1792 ; ACCC v Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 199 at [42] . 
 
 

 
 
 
 That is not altogether surprising. The purpose of s 53 has been described as being to "[support] s 52 by enumerating specific types of conduct which, if engaged in by a corporation in trade or commerce in connection with the promotion or supply of goods or services, [would] give rise to a breach of the Act": see R Miller, Miller's Annotated Trade Practices Act (30th ed, 2009), [1.53.5]. Accordingly, and in the absence of any submission to the contrary, I see no reason why the application of s 53(e) should not fall to be determined upon the conclusions I reach in relation to s 52 - namely that the representations were misleading and deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.
