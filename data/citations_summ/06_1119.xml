<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] SADC 2">[22] His Honour's remarks provide guidance in respect of a common species of futility. They were not intended to limit the discretion. [23] As Stone J observed in Smith v Airservices Australia [24] the circumstances in which proceedings may be perceived as futile are diverse: 
 
 Often an application for leave to discontinue proceedings is made because the applicant believes that further prosecution of the proceedings has become futile. This may be because the applicant believes he or she will be unable to substantiate the claim or because the parties have settled their dispute or because a change in extrinsic circumstances means that the proceedings are no longer a necessary or appropriate means to the desired end. The reason for the futility is a relevant consideration in determining whether costs are to be awarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] WASC 125">30 The second to fifth defendants submitted that the action contained at its inception the seeds of its own futility and that the plaintiff assumed the risk of the proceedings becoming futile. Those defendants referred to the decision of Finn J in ACN 116 149 092 Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Ltd [2006] FCA 1119. The following summary of that proceeding is based upon paragraphs 1 --- 12 of the judgment of Finn J. The proceeding was one of a number instigated by Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd and its sympathisers in the context of Lion Nathan Australia's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to take over Coopers.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] VCAT 419">13 The real issue is the question of costs. Usually, of course, an Applicant seeking to withdrawn or discontinue must pay costs and this is what is contemplated by s74(2) of the 1998 Act. For a review of analogous principles see ACN 116 149 092 Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Ltd [2006] FCA 1119 referring to discussion by Stone J in Smith v Airservices Australia [2005] FCA 997 ; (2005) 146 FCR 37. However, the provision in s74(2)(b) does not prevent the Tribunal from making any other orders as to costs. See Smythe v Vero Insurance Ltd [2005] VCAT 2714. This case was not cited to me by either party.</sentence>
