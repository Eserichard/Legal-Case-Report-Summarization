<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] AATA 605">I am mindful that residence has two elements as discussed in Hafza v Director-General of Social Security [1985] FCA 164 ; (1985) 6 FCR 444 and Taslim v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2004] FCA 789 ; (2004) 138 FCR 70 and confirmed in Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs v Baccon [2006] FCA 773 ; (2006) 90 ALD 557. They are recognised to be a physical presence in a particular place, and the intention to treat the place as home. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] AATA 361">Branson J in Secretary, Department of Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs v Baccon [2006] FCA 773 referred to s 7(3)(f) of the Act and said, at paragraph 15: 
 As s 7(3)(f) reveals, for the purposes of the Act, it is, at the least, a relevant factor in determining whether a person is residing in Australia that he or she intends to remain permanently in Australia. 'Permanently' in this context does not mean forever, and it does not mean without ever leaving Australia whether for business or recreational purposes. It requires the person to have an enduring commitment to Australia as home (Taslim). ( Taslim v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2004] FCA 789 ; (2004) 138 FCR 70 ) . 
 
Accordingly, her Honour said that it was arguable that, in the context of the Act, a person cannot be an Australian resident and the resident of another country at the same time.
