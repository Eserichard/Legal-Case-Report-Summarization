<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 20">Mr Ford referred me to the decision of Weinberg J in Ejueyitsi v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs , [31] in relation to "burden of proof. " As helpful and important as that case is, it is plainly distinguishable from the case before me. The challenge before Weinberg J was that of "merits review. " The case before me is for judicial review. And in any event, it was not a mere semantic argument before Weinberg J where, at [91] of the judgment, his Honour referred to the error of a decision-maker to require that there be discharged a " persuasive burden of proof. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 921">In Ejueyitsu v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2006] FCA 328 ; (2006) 151 FCR 289 , at [36] Weinberg J quoted the following extract from a decision of Drummond J: "To say that notions of onus of proof are irrelevant is not, however, to say that it is not in some circumstances appropriate for the Tribunal to have regard to common law standards of proof, as opposed to the incidence of the burden of proof, and to reach conclusions of fact on some matters only if satisfied as to the existence of those facts "on the balance of probabilities arising from the available information before the decision maker. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1782">23 I accept that if it is demonstrated, as contended, that the Tribunal approached its statutory task on an incorrect basis such as misunderstanding the real chance test or applying an inappropriate burden of proof, there is jurisdictional error: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 ; Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2003) 197 ALR 389 and Ejueyitsi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 328 ; (2006) 151 FCR 289. Similarly, if the Tribunal failed to consider relevant evidence and claims: see A Goninan &amp; Co Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [1997] FCA 424 ; (1997) 75 FCR 200 at 211; SCAT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 80 and Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 ; (2001) 194 ALR 244.  37 As to the second issue relating to the burden of proof, I consider that the Federal Magistrate was correct; the claim that the Tribunal had impermissibly imposed a burden of proof on the appellants must be rejected on a correct reading of the Tribunal's reasons. There is simply nothing to suggest the Tribunal imposed a burden of proof on the appellants or required corroboration. In fact, an analysis of the transcript of the Tribunal would suggest the opposite. This is not a case like that in Ejueyitsi [2006] FCA 328 ; 151 FCR 289 , where the Tribunal impermissibly imposed a burden of proof on the appellant, and thereby committed jurisdictional error. Here, there is no reference to burden of proof in the Tribunal's reasons. This is a simple case of the Tribunal making findings on the appellants' claim and deciding against the appellants on the merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 1106">That is sufficient to constitute jurisdictional error according to the Applicant's submissions (see Ejueyitsi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2006] FCA 328 ; (2006) 151 FCR 289).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCAFC 89">6 On appeal to this Court Weinberg J found that the Tribunal's decision concerning Mr Ejueyitsi's marital relationship with Ms Khan was affected by jurisdictional error; [2006] FCA 328. His Honour remitted the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court for further consideration explaining at [108]:
 
 ... when an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court is allowed, as this appeal will be, this Court should ordinarily make the orders that the Federal Magistrates Court itself ought to have made. However, where the Federal Magistrates Court has not completed its task of judicial review, as is the position in the present case, then as a general rule it ought to be required to do so. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 169">] 
 [28] The applicant relies upon Ejueyitsi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [footnote: [2006] FCA 328] , but nothing in that case is inconsistent with the propositions set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] FMCA 1900">In the appeal, which is Ejueyitsi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 328 , the reasons for judgment succinctly set out the issues raised on appeal in the following paragraph: 
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] FMCA 1035">" It was submitted the Tribunal was wrong to impose a persuasive burden on an Applicant in this situation (see Ejueyitsi v the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 328).</sentence>
