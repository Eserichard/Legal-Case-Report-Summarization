<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1500">On that assumption, I will now consider the questions of whether damages would be an adequate remedy, the balance of convenience and the balance of justice. In Sebel Furniture Ltd v Acoustic &amp; Felts Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 6 ; (2009) 80 IPR 244 at [25] ---[31] (pp 250---251), I explained these concepts as follows: The remaining questions identified by Mason ACJ in Castlemaine require Sebel to show that: 
 
 
 (a) it will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and
 (b) the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction. 
 
 
 The first of these matters involves an assessment by the court as to whether the claimant would, in all material respects, be in as good a position if he were confined to his damages remedy, as he would be in if an injunction were granted: see the discussion of this aspect in ICF Spry, The principles of equitable remedies: specific performance, injunctions, rectification and equitable damages, 7th ed, Lawbook, Pyrmont, 2007, pp 383---9; 397---9 and 457---62. The second of these matters requires the court to exercise a discretion.</sentence>

In the absence of copyright design or trade mark protection a person is free to copy a rival's product so long as the product is clearly identified as being of his own: see eg Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 200 per Gibbs CJ; Philips Electronics NV and Another v Remington Consumer Products Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 40 IPR 279 (' Philips ( 1997) 40 IPR 279 ') per Lehane J at 294; Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; (2000) 100 FCR 90 (' Remington [2000] FCA 876 ; (2000) 100 FCR 90 ') at [37] --- [47]; Dr Martens Australia Pty Ltdv Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd and Others (1999) 44 IPR 281 at 358 per Goldberg J; Sebel [2009] FCA 6 ; (2009) 80 IPR 244 per Foster J at [176] --- [181]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 562">In Sebel Furniture Limited v Acoustic &amp; Felts Pty Limited [2009] FCA 6 I discussed the relevant principles to be applied by this Court in considering whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction in aid of private rights. At [19]---[31], I said: In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199 , a majority of the High Court held that, where an interlocutory injunction is sought (inter alia) in respect of private rights, it is necessary to identify the legal or equitable rights which are to be determined at the trial and in respect of which the final relief is sought.

 The applicant pay the respondent's costs of and incidental to the interlocutory hearing which took place before the Court on 23 December last.

There was no dispute between the parties as to the principles which attend the granting of interlocutory injunctions. In a judgment recently delivered in Sebel Furniture Limited v Acoustic and Felts Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 6 ( Sebel's case) at paras 19-31, Foster J offers a comprehensive summary of those principles, which I gratefully adopt: 
 THE RELEVANT PRINCIPLES (INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTIONS) 

 In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199 , a majority of the High Court held that, where an interlocutory injunction is sought (inter alia) in respect of private rights, it is necessary to identify the legal or equitable rights which are to be determined at the trial and in respect of which the final relief is sought.
