<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1037">In Martens [2009] FCA 207 ; 108 ALD 83 , Logan J observed that it was relevant for the Minister, when considering an application requesting a reference under s 672A of the Code, to consider whether there was presented with the application evidence which might, arguably, when the whole case was considered, at least raise a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the applicant (at [51]). His Honour further observed: 
 
 The existence of a discretion [in the Minister] undoubtedly means that a convicted offender has no right to the reference of his case. That the reference power is discretionary indicates that it was contemplated that the Minister would make some evaluative judgment as to whether a reference ought to be made but not in so doing usurp the role that was consigned to an appeal court in the event of a reference. In this sense, the Minister is a "gatekeeper" who has a role in ensuring that the public interest in the administration of justice as furthered by the efficient allocation of judicial resources is not subverted by the referring of cases to the Court of Appeal which must inevitably fail. That the Court of Appeal on a reference itself had power to disregard grounds which it considered frivolous would not, in my opinion, prevent a Minister from refusing to refer a case where there was neither any new evidence nor even a ground of challenge not previously adversely considered, but care would need to be taken not to treat as frivolous a reasonable argument with which the Minister happened to disagree. (at [53]) 
 

  
 

 
 
 I will generally only recommend that the Governor-General grant a pardon where I am satisfied that an offender is: 
 

 Morally and technically innocent of the offence, and that there is no remaining avenue of appeal against his or her conviction, or
 Morally and technically innocent of the offence and there are exceptional circumstances justifying the grant of a pardon, despite avenues of appeal remaining open to the offender, taking into account the need to respect the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary. 
 
 No criteria are specified in section 672A of the Queensland Criminal Code to guide my decision on whether to refer a case to the Court of Appeal. However, in line with the decision of the Federal Court of Australia in Martens v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 207 , I will only refer a matter to the Court of Appeal if the application presents evidence which might, arguably, when the whole case is considered, at least raise a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the applicant. 
 

 
 
 Having regard to all the relevant information, I am not satisfied that you are morally and technically innocent of the offence under paragraph 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 of which you were convicted. Accordingly, I have decided not to recommend that the Governor-General grant you a pardon. I respectfully apply the reasoning of Logan J in Martens [2009] FCA 207 ; 108 ALD 83 to the circumstances before me. I accept that the Minister is the decision-maker in the circumstances of this case in terms of s 672A of the Code, and that the Minister's decision is subject to review under the ADJR Act. In any event, I do not understand these issues to be in contention between the parties.  The application of s 672A of the Code where a person seeks referral of a case to the Court of Appeal of Queensland in respect of an offence under Commonwealth (as distinct from State) criminal law was considered in detail by Logan J in Martens v Commonwealth [2009] FCA 207 ; (2009) 108 ALD 83. In that case his Honour held, inter alia , that: Section 68(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) provides for Commonwealth criminal law to be administered in each State on the same footing as State law. In the Executive Government of the Commonwealth, Ministerial consideration of an application for referral of a case to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s 672A of the Code falls to the Minister for Home Affairs. The decision of the Minister to decline to exercise power under s 672A of the Code is reviewable under the ADJR Act.  In considering this submission, in my view the questions for this Court are: whether the Minister was presented with evidence which might, arguably, when the whole case was considered, at least raise a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted Mr Nudd; and whether the Minister has failed to consider such evidence at all or failed to evaluate it by reference to such a test (cf Martens [2009] FCA 207 ; 108 ALD 83 at [51] ). </sentence>
