<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 308">On 3 June 2008, Justice Buchanan made orders dismissing the application that commenced proceedings ( Tadros v J and R Investment Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [ 2008] FCA 832) pursuant to the summary judgment provisions of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (s 31A) and directed Mr Tadros to pay the costs of the first to sixth respondents. Buchanan J stated : 
 
" [1] This matter has a long, chequered and unsatisfactory history. All parties have been in breach of the Court's orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 733">On the same day the applicant filed a notice of motion in the Federal Court seeking to have the Federal Court proceedings transferred to the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Buchanan J dismissed that notice of motion on 29 August 2007 on the basis that there were no proceedings pending before the Supreme Court which might provide a foundation for the transfer request (see Tadros v J &amp; R Investment Services Pty Ltd (No.2) [2008] FCA 832 at [2] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 55">434 In the course of her reasons for judgment delivered on 18 December 2008, the primary Judge said that, during the course of the hearing before her, LED Technologies stated that it no longer sought relief against Mr Morrison. In final orders made on 24 February 2009, her Honour ordered that LED Technologies' claims against Mr Morrison be dismissed, and that it pay Mr Morrison's costs of those claims incurred after 10 April 2008. In her Honour's reasons given that day, the only reference to Mr Morrison's costs was the following:
 In relation to para 5 of the Orders, I have not awarded costs to the Fifth Respondent on an indemnity basis. Not only was the application not actively pursued at the hearing, I do not consider that the Fifth Respondent has established any basis for costs to be awarded on an indemnity basis: see Colgate-Palmolive Company and Another v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234 per Sheppard J; Bagshaw v Scott [2005] FCA 104 at [39] - [43] per Bennett J; Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (formerly known as Citicorp Australia Ltd) (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] per Finn J; Ruaro v Ferrari [2008] FCA 307 at [17] per Emmett J; Tadros v J &amp; R Investment Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 832 [13]-[16] per Buchanan J. Otherwise, her Honour contented herself with saying that the costs orders which she proposed to make (which included the order relating to Mr Morrison's costs) "deal with the issues of costs on the claim, the cross claims and the costs of those cross claims in the most appropriate manner". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 141">In relation to para 5 of the Orders, I have not awarded costs to the Fifth Respondent on an indemnity basis.
