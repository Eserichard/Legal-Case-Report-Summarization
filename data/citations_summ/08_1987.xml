<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 530">The parties agree, and I accept, that the Court should inform itself of the facts relevant to the grant of declaratory relief by reference to the statement of agreed facts, the admissions contained in Australia Post's Defence, and the parties' consent to the granting of the declaratory relief. This is consistent with the approach taken in other cases involving clause 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the OHS Act: see Comcare v Linfox Australia Pty Ltd (2010) 198 IR 160 (" Linfox ") at 167 [35] and Comcare v Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1987 ; (2008) 107 ALD 578 (" Post Logistics ") at 583 [24]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1220">Pursuant to s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) the Court has jurisdiction to make declarations of right "whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed". Clause 2(1) of schedule 2 to the OH&amp;S Act states that if there has been a breach of (inter alia) s 21(1) of the Act the court "must make a declaration" to that effect. In Comcare v Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1987 ; (2008) 178 IR 200 at [21] Flick J followed a reference to this provision with a comment as to the discretionary nature of the power to make declarations conferred by the Federal Court of Australia Act and commented that the power "is not to be limited by the laying down of rules as to the manner of its exercise" and quoted the following observations of Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 581-2: 
 
 It is now accepted that superior courts have inherent power to grant declaratory relief. It is a discretionary power which "[i]t is neither possible nor desirable to fetter ... by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise. " However, it is confined by the considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 793">The parties have submitted that it is appropriate for the Court to inform itself of the facts necessary for the granting of declaratory relief by reference to the statement of agreed facts, the agreed statement of claim and the consent of the parties to the granting of the declaratory relief (see Comcare v Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1987 ; (2008) 107 ALD 578 (at [24]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 771">The maximum pecuniary penalty that might be imposed in this case is equivalent to $242,000.00. I note that in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 662 a penalty of $198,000.00 was imposed. In Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 , a pecuniary penalty of $20,000.00 was imposed. In Comcare v Postal Logistics Australasia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 1987 ; (2008) 178 IR 200 a pecuniary penalty of $165,000.00 was imposed. In Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 700 , a pecuniary penalty of $210,000.00 was imposed. Save in the National Gallery case, which was a minor matter on any view, the other three pecuniary penalties were imposed where the consequences of contravention were the death of an employee.  However, I also concur with North J, in his emphasis of the overriding caution expressed by Flick J in Comcare v Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1987 ; (2008) 178 IR 200 , where His Honour said that care must be taken to ensure that any listing of potentially relevant considerations do not themselves become an impermissible substitute for considering the terms of the legislation in issue or an unnecessary constraint upon a discretion conferred in otherwise unconfined terms. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 700">Subject to the overriding caution expressed by Flick J in Comcare v Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd (2008) 178 IR 200 ; [2008] FCA 1987 at [38] in the passage which follows, these statements reflect the proper approach to assessing penalty: 
 Care must be taken to ensure that any listing of potentially relevant considerations do not themselves become an impermissible substitute for considering the terms of the legislation in issue or an unnecessary constraint upon a discretion conferred in otherwise unconfined terms.
