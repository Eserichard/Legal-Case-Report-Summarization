<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1075">It is to be observed that s 1323 does not sanction making such an order. But in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Wiggins (1998) 90 FCR 314 , I suggested that such an order could be made under the Court's general powers. See also Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 14) [2007] FCA 310 ; (2007) 158 FCR 92 and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Burnard [2007] NSWSC 1217 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 360.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1021">6 The argument put by ASIC in relation to the s 1323 element of its application was that I should make an order under s 23 as an incident of my power to make an order under s 1323. This would be on the basis that I was satisfied that receivers could be appointed under s 1323 and could then resort to s 23 as a fallback position: see Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission; In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd ACN 099 071 968 v Carey (No 14) [2007] FCA 310. I think the preferable course here is to go directly to s 23 and the power it confers in aid of the jurisdiction invoked in these proceedings. In my opinion, at least for the purposes of making an interim order under s 23 and allowing parties further time to consider their position and also to consider the position of third parties who have not been served, there is sufficient to warrant my making an interlocutory freezing order.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] NSWSC 961">However, the ASIC has indicated that it does not seek to base the order on some other power because it would not thereby obtain the advantage conferred by s 1323(4), namely, the advantage of not being required to give an undertaking as to damages. "

22 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No. 14) [2007] FCA 310 ; (2007) 158 FCR 92 ; 25 ACLC 184 , ASIC sought " freezing or Mareva type orders ", or alternatively, an order for the appointment of receivers to the property of a defendant who was the subject of an ongoing investigation by ASIC. The defendant was a " relevant person " within the meaning of s 1323 being a person who was, or might become liable, to pay money to an "aggrieved person", being Westpoint Corporation. The application was said to be made both under s 1323 of the Corporations Act , and pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), and what was said to be the implied jurisdiction of the Federal Court (at 94 [4]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] NSWSC 948">

13 Subsection (4) should be read in conjunction with s246(1) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 , which so far as it is relevant in these proceedings reads as follows:

 246 Liability for damages 

(1) None of the following: 
 
....
 
 (a) ASIC; 
 
.... 

is liable to an action or other proceeding for damages for or in relation to an act done or omitted in good faith in performance or purported performance of any function, or in exercise or purported exercise of any power, conferred or expressed to be conferred by or under the corporations legislation, or a prescribed law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory. Freezing orders and s1323 

 14 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 14) [2007] FCA 310 ; (2007) 158 FCR 92 , French J observed at 100 [29] that s1323 "does not provide for a general freezing order of the kind sought by ASIC" in that case. Finkelstein J had made the same point some years earlier in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Wiggins (1998) 90 FCR 314 at 319. 15 Finkelstein and French JJ both accepted that the Court could make a freezing order even though it was not expressly authorised by s1323.</sentence>
