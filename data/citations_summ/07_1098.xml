<citphrase id="cp1.15" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">migration act 1958 (cth), ss 6 , 6a. in an application for review of a decision of the minister for immigration and ethnic affairs made in 1984 refusing an application for a permanent entry permit to an applicant who was the spouse of a permanent resident on the basis that the applicant's marriage had been assessed as being one where the parties did not genuinely intend to continue living as a married couple in australia, it being the minister's policy to refuse permanent entry permits in such cases.  held: (1) that relevant considerations which should have been taken into account were not, thus making the minister's decision invalid pursuant to s 5(2)(b) of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (the act), such considerations being:  (i) a report made in 1981 by an interviewing officer in suva expressing an opinion that the marriage relationship was genuine, such report being part of the history of the relationship, all of which was relevant in determining the quality of the marriage as at the date of the minister deciding the application. although the report was not presented to the minister, it was on the departmental file and was accordingly to be regarded as being constructively before him.  peko-wallsend ltd v. minister for aboriginal affairs (1985) 59 alr 51 , referred to.  (ii) statutory declarations of neighbours and acquaintances as to the applicant leading a normal married life and a letter of a social worker as to the applicant's wife living at home with the applicant, such documents being available to the minister, but there being nothing to indicate that he had taken any account of them.  (2) that in determining whether an administrative decision made under statutory authority falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp1.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 902">The Minister referred to the judgement of in Li v Minster for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1098 ; 96 ALD 361 where Justice Kenny decided at [19]: "Further, I accept that, as the first respondent submitted, the absence of specific reference to persistence in the Tribunal's reasons does not demonstrate a failure to take into account "all the circumstances of the relationship" for the purposes of reg 1.15A(3). " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1367">It appears to me that the term 'married' has a specific legal meaning, clearly defined in Australia by the Marriage Act . The meaning of married is a well defined legal term that has great importance in Constitutional issues when the Commonwealth exercises power with respect to matrimonial causes. Of course, the power to make regulations under the Migration Act does not depend in any way upon the matrimonial causes power, and it is open to the government to define the term 'married' to have a broader definition for the purposes of the Migration Act than it would have for constitutional law or in legislation relying on the matrimonial causes power. It is open to the legislature to define 'marriage' as it sees fit for the purpose of the Migration Act : Li v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1098 , (2007) 96 ALD 361 [2007] ALMD 7080 at [12] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1372">18 There was, however, no opposition to advancing the submission as to a failure to make inquiries in terms of the decision being unreasonable. So structured, the dispute centred upon whether or not it was unreasonable not to have made further inquiries. No submission was advanced on behalf of the Appellant, nor could it have been advanced, that the power of the Tribunal to make further inquiries imposed upon it " any duty or obligation to do so ": Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 at [43] , 207 ALR 12 at 21---2 per Gummow and Hayne JJ. See also: SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 at [46] , [2007] FCA 1592 ; 164 FCR 14 at 25 per Allsop J; WAGJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 277 at [24] . Nor was any submission advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister that there was not a line of inquiry which was readily available to the Tribunal and centrally relevant to the task being undertaken: eg, Li v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1098 at [28] , [2007] FCA 1098 ; 96 ALD 361 at 367 per Kenny J. The simple submission advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister was that there was material upon which the Tribunal could justifiably have based its decision and there was, in those circumstances, no duty to inquire further. The response of the Association was disclosed to the now Appellant and he provided his response.</sentence>
