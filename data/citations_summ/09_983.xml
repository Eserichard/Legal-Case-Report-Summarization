Besanko J then simply stated that the ACIs were a form of departmental policy being approved by a senior departmental officer, and not the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 640">In relation to his contention that the Instructions are ultra vires , Mr Levingston noted that it is accepted that government policy must be consistent with statute: Drake . Thus, policy should not be used to impose additional criteria to those enacted by the Parliament. In this instance, the Instructions are departmental guidelines and should be given a greater degree of scrutiny than, for example, Ministerial directions given pursuant to s 499(1) of the Migration Act 1958 : Hneidi v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2009) 50 AAR 252 ; [2009] FCA 983. </sentence>
