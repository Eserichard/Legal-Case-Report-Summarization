<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 35">The causes of action relied upon by the applicant in this case include contraventions of the Trade Practices Act, breaches of fiduciary duty and breaches of contract. EGR accepted on this application that the causes of action arising out of s 82 of the Trade Practices Act are personal and cannot be assigned: Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1532 ; Pearl Coast Divers Pty Ltd (in liq) v Cossack Pearls Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 927 ; 249 ALR 591. During argument, counsel accepted as the amended notice of motion is framed that the assignment could, if valid, only be effective in assigning any cause of action or chose in action in contract. It follows therefore that if the assignment were valid EGR could only prosecute that part of the proceedings relating to a claim of breach of contract and leave to the applicant to prosecute the cause of action under the Trade Practices Act and in equity. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 582">76 There have been further developments since McDougall J spoke. It has been contended that references to Trendtex in the High Court in Campbells Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostiff Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 , 229 CLR 386 favour a wider view of assignability. In my opinion the references made by Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ at paras [79]-[81] pp 431, 432 were not expressions of opinion on the authority of Trendtex or of Poulton . These observations do not clearly establish any authoritative position; any more than do the observations in Poulton . I was also referred to Scholle Industries Pty Ltd v AEP Industries (NZ) Ltd [2007] SASC 322 , 99 SASR 178 (White J) and Salfinger v New Guinea Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1532 (Heerey J) which show that a division of opinion continues. The review made in Mijac Investments Pty Ltd v Graham No. 2 [2009] FCA 773 (Gordon J) at 30-32 shows, to my mind, that this is not a well-settled field.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1169">Further, in so far as a cause of action in conversion is pleaded, a right of action in tort is incapable of assignment: see Poulton v The Commonwealth (1953) 89 CLR 540 at 602 per Williams, Webb &amp; Kitto JJ; Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1532 per Heerey J at [115]-[120] ( Salfinger ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 109">Challenging the validity of the assignment, ICM relied on two propositions before the Federal Magistrate: 
(a) The cause of action was unable to be assigned by AAC to Mr Young because it was a bare cause of action and Mr Young had no genuine commercial interest to support he assignment (ICM cited Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1532 at [108] - [124]; Monk v The Australian &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Limited (1994) 34 NSWLR 148 at 152 ( Monk )); 
 
(b) The assignment was procured in breach of fiduciary duties owed by Mr Young to the shareholders of AAC, and on this basis the proper exercise of the Court's discretion would be to refuse to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice (ICM cited Re Daley; ex parte National Australia Bank Ltd [1992] FCA 395 ; (1992) 37 FCR 390 at 395 ( Daley )). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 1038">Mr Muston submits that any claim which AAC has against ICM Agriculture has not been validly assigned to Mr Young. In making that submission, Mr Muston contends that: The Court cannot be satisfied on the evidence that there has been a valid assignment; The Court cannot be satisfied that any purported assignment has not been procured contrary to the fiduciary duties owed by the applicant to AAC: Re Daley ; Mr Young does not have a genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of the claim such as to enable a valid assignment: Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1532 at [108] - [124] and the cases referred to therein; Monk v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 927">Causes of action arising pursuant to s 82 of the TPA are personal and cannot be assigned: Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No. 3) [2007] FCA 1532 at [110] and the cases cited therein, in particular, Park v Allied Mortgage Corporation Ltd [1993] FCA 286 ; (1993) ATPR Digest 46-105. By parity of reasoning, claims arising pursuant to s 79 of the FTA cannot be assigned. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1594">1 On 8 October 2007 I ordered that the separate question to be determined be answered in the negative with judgment for the respondents with costs: Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1532. I found that the applicant's claim was entirely without merit and fraudulent. I gave the applicant leave to file written submissions within seven days to show cause why costs should not be on an indemnity basis. </sentence>
