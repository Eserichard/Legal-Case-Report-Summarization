<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] FCA 1426">9 In summary, the respondent has submitted:
 
&#8226; Where an appeal arises from a decision which has now been set aside, the appeal should be dismissed and the appellant ordered to pay the respondent's costs of and incidental to the appeal. &#8226; The appropriate way to proceed in relation to decisions in the Federal Magistrates Court under r 13.10 is to make an application to set aside the decision under r 16.05. The appellant eventually did this and was successful in having the decision set aside. This approach has been endorsed in a number of cases including MZWXC v MIMIA [2006] FCA 172 and MLGXAL v MIMIA [2006] FCA 966. &#8226; The appeal in this matter was always misconceived as to the proper course to proceed, and incompetent as no application for leave to appeal was filed. &#8226; The decision of Jarrett FM on the substantive hearing has no relevance to this appeal. Further, Ms Wheatley for the respondent submitted in Court this morning that costs in this appeal bear no relevance to the new matter before Jarrett FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1175">Unfortunately he did not attend the hearing of that application on 6 April 2006. Because he did not attend, his application was dismissed pursuant to r 13.03A(c) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules. The applicant then applied to this Court for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court on 4 July 2006. Leave is required because the judgment is interlocutory. See s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and MLGXAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 966. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1174">Consequently, the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court was an interlocutory judgment requiring leave to appeal under s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): See MLGXAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 966.</sentence>
