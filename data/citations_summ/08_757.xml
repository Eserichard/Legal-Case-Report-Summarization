<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 112">But if, as a finding of fact, the tribunal finds that the impairment was in fact permanent before the date of commencement of the 1992 Act then it isn't determined under the provisions of the 1992 Act, it's determined under the provisions of the predecessor. That's just a question of fact. Now, you know, and that's why the Excell case [ Excell v Comcare [2008] FCA 757] is relevant. So I can't control what findings of fact you may make, and indeed in a case where the injury occurred in 1972 it's at least possible, if not probable, that the issue of the date of permanency may be a live one on the facts and that's what I'm covering. I'm covering both the possible permutations of findings of fact in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] AATA 553">Whilst Mrs Cavanagh and those treating her no doubt hoped that the stimulator would provide permanent relief, this did not in fact occur. An infection occurred and the stimulator had to be removed. It is well established that courts and tribunals may determine issues with the benefit of hindsight, where evidence is available prior to the time when a decision is given : see the authorities cited in Re Wagener and Comcare [2003] AATA 1083 ; (2003) 78 ALD 596 at [33] --- [34]. A recent example of that approach in the context of a claim for permanent impairment is Excell v Comcare [2008] FCA 757 , at [41]. </sentence>
