<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] ATMO 3">As to the connotation alleged to be inherent in the third trade mark, the Applicant argued that: 
... a case which depends on connotation based on colour (or colours) alone is, it is submitted, of an entirely different class to that which depends on connotation based on a word (or words). A word, such as place or country name, for example, 'BAVARIA', may give rise to an immediate connotation that a product is associated with, or derives from, that place. Such a word alone, without more, may give rise to such a connotation: eg. Bavaria NV v Bayerischer Brauerbund eV [2009] FCA 428 ; (2009) 81 IPR 279 at [70] ,[89]. However, as soon as the matter ventures into the territory of having to take account of other issues, such as the extent of surrounding material (including colours and other words), then it is submitted that the task confronted by an Opponent in establishing this opposition ground is made considerably more difficult: see Bavaria at [89]-[111]. The present case falls within this camp, particularly as the only word contained in the Opposed Mark does not, in itself, have any meaning (such as a place name). ... Even if the Third Series Mark (being the only mark within the series which is in colour) did invoke reference to the Italian flag, or Italy (which is denied), the mere 'invoking' of such a reference does not establish that consumers would be likely to be deceived or confused: see McCorquodale v Masterton [2004] FCA 1247 ; (2005) 63 IPR 582 at [33] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1380">When considering the question of deceptive similarity, each mark must be compared as a whole. This is of particular significance in relation to composite marks and device marks which may consist of a number of elements: Angelides v James Stedman Hendersons Sweets Ltd [1927] HCA 34 ; (1927) 40 CLR 43 at 68. It is necessary to look at all these elements in their context. This will include the size, prominence and stylisation of words and device elements used in the mark and their relationship to each other: Crazy Ron's Communications Pty Ltd v Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd (2004) 209 ALR 1 ; [2004] FCAFC 196 at [91] - [103]; Bavaria NV v Bayerischer Brauerbund eV ; [2009] FCA 428 ; (2009) 177 FCR 300 at [21] - [22] and [32]. The impression created by the mark, considered as a whole, can only be determined by doing this. However, in this connection, it is recognised that deceptive similarity may be established when an impugned mark uses an "essential" or "distinguishing" feature of the mark as registered. This proposition may be illustrated by reference to the following leading cases. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1367">After referring to Kitto J's judgment in Clark Equipment , Bennett J in Bavaria NV v Bayerischer Brauerbund eV [2009] FCA 428 made the following comments: 
 
 This has led to the rejection of a word of prima facie geographical signification, particularly when it is used simpliciter and where goods of the kind for which it is sought to be registered are produced at the place or in the area (Clark Equipment at 515-516), or if it is reasonable to suppose that such goods in the future would be produced there (Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford (Trading as Oxford University Press) v Registrar of Trade Marks [1990] FCA 175 ; [1990] FCA 175 ; (1990) 24 FCR 1 at 23 per Gummow J). This is because other traders have a legitimate interest in using the geographical name to identify their goods and it is this interest which is not to be supplanted by permitting any one trader to effect trade mark registration (Clark Equipment at 514-515). Justice Gummow in University of Oxford came to the view that, if a court is in doubt as to the likelihood of another trader legitimately wishing to use a mark, the application should be refused (at 25). In Clark Equipment, Kitto J held that the word MICHIGAN was not adapted and was not capable of becoming adapted to distinguish earth-moving and other equipment. Similarly, OXFORD was refused for printed publications (University of Oxford) and COLORADO refused for bags (Colorado Group Ltd v Strandbags Group Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 184 ; (2007) 164 FCR 506). In each case, the registration sought was of a word mark that connoted a geographical location. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] ATMO 85">No evidence has been provided by the opponent to establish the existence of any connotations or meanings in the trade mark; [13] however such a requirement in these circumstances is unnecessary. I am satisfied that clear unambiguous meanings can be derived from the words HIMALAYAN SPRING MINERAL WATER - BOTTLED IN THE SACRED HIMALAYAS OF NEPAL TO THE VIBRATIONAL CHANTING OF TIBETAN MONKS. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] ATMO 20">The only relevant connotation would be an association with Leaf Guards and whether this connotation would result in confusion when used on the particular goods and services in the above application. In this case, use of the trade mark on: Power operated machine for use in production of a leaf rejecting seamless gutter would be unlikely to deceive or cause confusion as the public would not confuse a leaf guard with the machine used to produce it. In addition, the opponent's evidence is not sufficient [11] to support a proposition that consumers would be confused if use of the mark in relation to Installation of gutters for commercial and residential purposes misled an Australian consumer into believing that the applicant installed Leaf Guards, when in reality it did not offer that service. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] ATMO 82">Both representatives made brief submissions about the Federal Court decisions in Bavaria NV v Bayerischer Brauerbund eV [2009] FCA 428 , and Scotch Whisky Association v De Witt [2007] FCA 1649 ; (2007) 74 IPR 382. Ultimately, Mr Newman said that I lacked a sufficiently clear basis in the evidence from which to infer that there would be a significant likelihood of confusion. He noted the reference in Bavaria to the significance of a lack of evidence of confusion. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] ATMO 78">At the hearing, both parties referred to Verbrand Bayerischer Ausfuhrbrauerein Eingetragene Verein v Bavaria NV [2] , a decision of the Registrar that was at the time on appeal before the Federal Court. Shortly after the opposition hearing, Bennett J issued her decision in the appeal case (see Bavaria NV v Bayerischer Brauerbund eV [3] ). To give the parties an opportunity to address the findings of Bennett J as they may have related to the current opposition, I allowed the parties time after the hearing to make written submissions. Both parties provided additional submissions and I will refer to them, as well as the submissions they made at the hearing, as they are relevant.  The operation of this section of the Act has been considered in cases such as Pfizer [4] and more recently Bavaria NV [5] . In Pfizer , Gyles J said: 
"Connotation" is a secondary meaning implied by the mark. The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself. It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s 43 is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question, rather than, for example, deception by reason of similarity with other marks ( TGI Friday's Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday's Inc [2000] FCA 720 ; (2000) 100 FCR 358 at [43] , McCorquodale v Masterton [6] at [25] - [26]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] ATMO 68">Cases such as TGI Friday's Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday's Inc [4] , Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [5] and more recently Bavaria NV v Bayerischer Brauerbund eV [6] are authority for the proposition that the "connotation" must arise from something inherent in the trade mark itself and not from extraneous considerations.
