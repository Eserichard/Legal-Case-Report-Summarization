<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWLEC 83">Principles relating to uncertainty were summarised in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493 , 240 ALR 135 at [36] - [37] by Bennett J as follows (omitting citations): 
36 There is no general principle that uncertainty in an executive instrument spells invalidity. The question is whether what has been done in fact answers the description of what the statute permits to be done in law. A statutory notice such as a s 151AKA(10) notice or a Part A competition notice (together, 'the Statutory Notices') must not be so vaguely expressed that its meaning of application is a matter of real uncertainty. The Statutory Notices must convey, with reasonable and sufficient clarity and certainty, the subject matter with which they deal and enable the recipient to know what is required if their issue is to be a valid exercise of statutory power. Where different kinds of subject matter are dealt with by different statutory provisions, the Statutory Notices should specify or make clear which particular aspects of the statutory regime are referred to and/or relied upon. 37 The severity of prospective penalties or consequences of failure to comply with a statutory notice that flow from the subject matter and the impact of the characterisation of the conduct are relevant factors in identifying the requisite degree of certainty. Account is to be taken of the statutory context in which the issue of a statutory notice arises and of the relevant interests of third parties. To take an example relevant to a Part A competition notice, a third party may contemplate bringing an action for damages in reliance on that notice and has an interest in knowing with clarity the ambit and scope of the notice.  In Zhang v Canterbury City Council [2001] NSWCA 167 , 51 NSWLR 589 Spigelman CJ, who delivered the leading judgment, held that a matter which a statute required the decision-maker "to take into consideration" must be considered as a fundamental element in, or focal point of his deliberatons. A "mere formalistic reference" does not satisfy a statutory requirement to have regard to a matter: Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493 , 240 ALR 135 per Lindgren J at [29].

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] VSC 338"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 119">In this regard, the mere fact that parsing and analysis in the artificial atmosphere of the courtroom can lead to the identification of a number of latent ambiguities will not invalidate what, as a matter of common sense, is reasonably clear. 

 
 On appeal, the decision was affirmed: Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1983) 152 CLR 328. See also: S A Brewing Holdings Ltd v Baxt (1989) 23 FCR 357 at 370 per Fisher and French JJ; Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493 at [36] to [43] [2007] FCA 493 ; , 97 ALD 652 at 660 to 662 per Bennett J. Each statutory provision, of course, presents its own potential difficulties in construction. Section 155, for example, employs the language of " information " ( Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 at [18] , [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 at 175 to 176 per Tamberlin J) --- a term less certain in meaning than a " document ".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1640">27 In her earlier reasons ( Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493 ; (2008) 240 ALR 135) her Honour had held that a notice of invitation in purported compliance with s 151AKA(10)(a) that ACCC had in fact given to Telstra differed from the later Pt A competition notice in its subject-matter and the kind of anti-competitive conduct it described, as a result of which Telstra had been denied procedural fairness and natural justice under the Act and at common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 564">In Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493 ; 240 ALR 135 Bennett J was called on to determine whether the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the ACCC") was required, by s 13 of the ADJR Act, to provide reasons for its decision to issue a competition notice to Telstra under s 151AKA of the Trade Practices Act . The purpose of such a notice was to give the recipient a warning that it was engaging in proscribed anti-competitive conduct. If the recipient of the notice, despite the warning, continued to engage in the conduct certain consequences might follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] NSWSC 40">
 
 

123 In the present case it is accepted, of course, that the plaintiff had a specific interest. The seriousness of the consequences of a decision taken in relation to the s.66(1) powers is a relevant matter in determining the content of the requirement for procedural fairness: Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493 ; (2007) 240 ALR 135 at [241] per Bennett J. So also, the specific public interest, the subject of s.66 , is a consideration to be considered and balanced in making a determination of that kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1905">1 In Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493 (' Telstra No 2' ), I considered a Part A competition notice ('the Competition Notice') issued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('the Commission') pursuant to s 151AKA(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act'). Telstra challenged the issue of the Competition Notice and the written notice given by the Commission pursuant to s 151AKA(10) of the Act prior to the issue of the Competition Notice ('the Consultation Notice'). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1639">This is in contrast with their agreement as the respondent's substantial degree of power in the Wholesale Market. Indeed Mr Williams gave evidence at the hearing that he was not an expert in the Retail Market (TS p 88 ll 40-42) and that he had not put his mind to whether the applicant had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market (TS p 78 ll 3-4). &#8226; Conduct in a wholesale market which in turn affects levels of competition in a "downstream" retail market is a relatively common phenomenon, and issues relevant to this phenomenon have been considered in this court, for example, in the context of claims of alleged anti-competitive conduct in Pt XIB TPA ( Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493) , in relation to claims for access to services under Pt IIIA TPA ( Sydney Airport Corporation Limited v Australian Competition Tribunal [2006] FCAFC 146) , and in the context of acquisitions claimed to result in a substantial lessening of competition ( Australian Gas Light Company (ACN 052 167 405) v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (No 3) [2003] FCA 1525). However, the ability of an entity to "substantially influence patterns of competition" in a retail market because of its market power in a wholesale market, as agreed by the experts, is not, in my view, necessarily tantamount to "a substantial degree of market power" in the Retail Market or even, as submitted by the respondent, "market power" within the meaning of the s 46 TPA. &#8226; As I have already noted, the activities of the applicant and the respondent in the Retail Market are quite different, supplying different services to different customers.</sentence>
