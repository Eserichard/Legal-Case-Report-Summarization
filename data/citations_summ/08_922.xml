<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 918">Furthermore, I note what was found in a matter on appeal from this Court in the Federal Court. In SZJBD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 922 (" SZJBD ") (per Siopis J), the Court was relevantly presented with circumstances where (in proceedings before this Court) the Federal Magistrate had not admitted the "tapes" of the Tribunal hearing into evidence, and therefore did not listen to the "tapes" of the Tribunal hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 106">60 The applicant appealed to this Court and was successful ( SZJBD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 922 ( "SZJBD" ) although the complaint made on the appeal appears to have been differently focussed than it was in the FMCA. The judge of this Court who heard the appeal recorded (at [5]):
 "5 The appellant appeared in person before me. She complained that the Tribunal had been biased and that the Federal Magistrate should have listened to the tape. I have construed the appellant's contention to be that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to receive into evidence the tape recording of the proceeding which the appellant relied upon in support of the ground of review founded on apprehended bias. " 
and (at [19]):
 "19 The effect of what the appellant said to me by way of oral submission was that the Tribunal had asked questions which indicated that it had a closed mind on whether she was a Falun Gong practitioner and that the Tribunal and interpreter had acted oppressively during the hearing. The appellant also said that the Federal Magistrate should have listened to the tape of the hearing before the Tribunal. As I have previously mentioned, I have treated the appellant's complaint to be that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to accept the tender of evidence advanced to support the appellant's complaint of apprehended bias. "  18 As Siopis J commented at [23] of SZJBD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 922 , in the applicant's successful appeal to the Federal Court which resulted in the matter being remitted to the Federal Magistrate:
 Some of the questions the tribunal asked of the appellant appeared to be sufficiently peripheral as to cause some concern to the Federal Magistrate. It was at least arguable that the questions were capable of causing a fair-minded lay observer to query whether questions of this kind would be asked by a person seeking fairly to test whether the appellant was an adherent to Falun Gong.  108 At the initial hearing before in the Federal Magistrates Court, the magistrate refused to listen to the tape: SZJBD v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCMA 1829 at [12]. That determination was subject to an appeal to this Court. A judge of this Court determined that the decision not to listen to the tape involved error: SZJBD v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 922 at [25] . That judge set aside the federal magistrate's determination and remitted it to the federal magistrate for rehearing. In my opinion, there could thereafter be no circumstances which could justify the federal magistrate in refusing to listen to the tape. It is not open to a court lower in the judicial hierarchy to disobey a determination of an appellate court in that manner. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1485">My decision was appealed. The appeal was heard by Siopis J on 28 February 2008. His Honour's judgment, SZJBD v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 922 , was handed down on 20 June 2008 and the gravamen of his decision is contained at [25]: "In my view, the Federal Magistrate erred, in the circumstances of this case, in failing to admit the tape of the hearing as evidence in support of an allegation of apprehended bias. This occurred because the Federal Magistrate failed to treat the complaint about the so called "misleading" questioning and oppressive behaviour by the interpreter as comprising incidents of a complaint of apprehended basis. It was not a sufficient answer to the appellant's real concern to point out, as did the Federal Magistrate, that the questions which the appellant could remember as being objectionable, were recorded in the Tribunal's reasons and that there was, therefore, no need to listen to the tape.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1284">These grounds were not previously raised, and were therefore not able to be considered by the Tribunal. They cannot be considered by this Court for two reasons: to do so would be to engage in impermissible merits review; and in any event, and notwithstanding that the applicant had an opportunity to file affidavits under the Court's Orders of 28 July 2008, there is no or no sufficient evidence to found the assertions made by the applicant. The Court notes that generally new evidence will not be admitted on an application for judicial review, save in support of a complaint about a lack of procedural fairness or an allegation of bias.
