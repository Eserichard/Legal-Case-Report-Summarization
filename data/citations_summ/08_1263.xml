<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1771">7 The appeal should be dismissed on that basis alone. Such a fundamental deficiency in a notice of appeal is not a mere matter of form; no original jurisdiction is vested in this Court to review errors perceived to have been committed by the Tribunal: SZLZM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1263. In Sathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 210 , Finn, Marshall and Goldberg JJ likewise emphasised the appellate role of this Court. Their Honours were there addressing an appeal which did at least allege error on the part of the Federal Magistrate, but they did go on to make the following observations as to attempts to review in this Court the reasons of the Tribunal: 
 [10] We granted leave at the commencement of the hearing to amend the grounds of appeal better to reflect the written submissions the appellant had filed in the appeal. The two errors now ascribed [to] her Honour's decision are that she failed to find (i) that the Tribunal did not address whether by reason of all of the claims made by the appellant, including those relating to events prior to 1997, the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason; and (ii) that the Tribunal erred in asking whether all Tamils would have such a well-founded fear. We should state at the outset that we do not consider there is substance in either ground. We would add that much of the appellant's submissions were directed to the proposition that the Tribunal had made errors in the way it had considered the evidence and issues before it. Although this occurred under the rubric of a consideration of the primary judge's reasons it was of little assistance in understanding why it was said that the primary judge fell into error. The Court wishes to emphasise that an appeal to the Full Court in a refugee matter should not be taken as an occasion to re-consider the Tribunal's reasons as distinct from considering the primary judge's reasons. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1343">31 Before me the Minister correctly noted that this argument had not been run before the federal magistrate. Two matters flowed from that. First, it was said that as a matter of discretion the ground should not be permitted to be raised. Given the nature of the point and the absence of prejudice to the Respondent, however, it seems appropriate to permit it to be entertained. Secondly, it was said that it was possible the Court might not have jurisdiction to entertain the point. Shortly, that argument was that because this Court has no original jurisdiction by reason of s 476A of the Act, it followed that the entertaining of a ground not raised before the learned Federal Magistrate necessarily entailed an exercise of that proscribed original jurisdiction. Flick J noted this argument in SZLZM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1263 at [18] but did not decide it since it was unnecessary to do so. Not having heard full argument on the matter, and it not being necessary, I take the same course. However, any such argument would need to accommodate the Full Court's decision in Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at 434-435 [20] , 438-440 [34]-[39] per Allsop J with Drummond and Mansfield JJ agreeing, and Applicant NAHV of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 102 ; (2003) 129 FCR 214 at 218-219 [21] per Carr, Kiefel and Allsop JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1279">7 No jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court to conduct a review of the Tribunal's decision upon the basis invited by the Notice of Appeal . The relevant jurisdiction of this Court is its appellate jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: Federal Court of Australia Act , s 24(1)(d). See also: SZLZM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1263 ; SZITO v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 758 at [4] ---[5], [32] per Greenwood J.</sentence>
