<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 475">The second and third decisions of the Tribunal were set aside in large part because they failed to consider an important aspect of the appellant's claim which focused on his inability to obtain state protection to exercise his right to protest and the involvement of the state in alleged persecutory conduct. See SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 91 at [65] to [69] and SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 321 at [28] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 145">After the remitter, the Tribunal invited the applicant to a hearing conducted by a second member, which he attended on 26 October 2006. The second Tribunal member handed down a decision on 7 December 2006. The decision was upheld in this Court (see SZGUW &amp; Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 1120) , but an appeal to the Federal Court was successful (see SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 91). Jacobson J on 21 February 2008 ordered that there be an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision, and an order in the nature of mandamus "requiring the Second Respondent to review according to law the decision made by" the delegate. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1246">The applicant alleged that the Tribunal rejected the various integers of his claims individually without considering them in their totality. He cited what Jacobson J had said in SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 91 at [53] and [54]: It is well established that in determining whether the persecutory conduct claimed by an applicant amounts to serious harm, the Tribunal is under a duty to consider the "totality of the case put forward": NBFP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 95 at [54] --- [62]; VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 927 ; (2004) 81 ALD 332 at [62] ; Khan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1478 at [31] . In doing so, it must consider each integer of the claims: VTAO at [62]; Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 ; (2001) 194 ALR 244. As Weinberg J said in MZWPD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1095 at [69] , the Tribunal was bound to consider each incident of alleged persecution, not merely in isolation but also in conjunction with the others. An act that might not amount to persecutory conduct involving serious harm when viewed in isolation may do so when considered in its full context. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 908">A failure on the part of the Refugee Review Tribunal to consider " a substantial aspect or integer " of a claim being advanced may likewise amount to a constructive failure to exercise its jurisdiction: SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 91 at [68] to [69] per Jacobson J. In Bhardwaj , supra , Callinan J concluded: 
 [163] ... If one thing is abundantly clear, it is that the Tribunal must, if an application has properly been made as it was here, review the Minister's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 782">However, as Jacobsen J said in SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 91 at [53] the Tribunal has a duty to consider the totality of the case put forward. His Honour referred to the judgment of Weinberg J in MZWPD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1095 at [69] that the Tribunal was bound to consider each incident of alleged persecution, not merely in isolation, but also in conjunction with the others. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 321">In his decision ([2008] FCA 91), Jacobson J concluded that the second Tribunal had failed to consider the appellant's claims in their totality. His Honour ruled that this amounted to a constructive failure to exercise the Tribunal's jurisdiction and, therefore, a jurisdictional error: see at [55]-[75]. In particular, Jacobson J concluded (at [65]-[69]) as follows: 
 [65] I do not see how the Tribunal could have proceeded to deal with the question of whether the appellant had a well-founded fear without first considering the full impact of the harm alleged by the appellant, taken in its full context.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 296">It has not been established that there was a failure to comply with s.425 of the Act. On the contrary, as indicated above, in the course of the hearing the Tribunal raised issues of concern, including the issue of the applicant's inability to demonstrate the movements without hesitation as it would have expected and the fact that the demonstration of the second set of exercises he provided bore no relation to the movements involved in the second set of exercises. It also raised the issue of the location of the Falun. In this way it raised with the applicant issues that it considered dispositive. I am not persuaded that it is necessary for the purposes of s.425 that the Tribunal put to the applicant the source of its concern, in so far as the source of the concern is based on independent country information, provided that it raises clearly with the applicant the nature of the its concern and the relevance of that concern. The Tribunal did so in this case. It is apparent that the applicant was put on notice by the Tribunal as to the matters in issue. More generally as to the obligation under s.425 and the Tribunal's obligation to inform of possible adverse findings see SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) and Another [2008] FCA 911 ; (2008) 102 ALD 598 and SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 91). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 1239">The applicant relied on Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 ; (2001) 194 ALR 244 at [42] per Allsop J and SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 91 at [68] --- [70] per Jacobson J. As Allsop J stated in Htun at [42] there is a distinction between errant fact-finding and a consideration of claims and their component integers, which are considerations made manditorily relevant by the Migration Act for consideration in the sense discussed in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Another v Peko-Wallsend Limited and Others [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323. The Tribunal's obligation is to address and deal with the claims as put to it. (See Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2003) 77 ALJR 1088 at [24] and NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at [55] --- [57]). As Jacobson J suggested in SZGUW (at [68]) the Tribunal's obligation is to consider "a substantial aspect or integer of the appellant's case that was sufficiently plain on the facts that were established (emphasis added)". Failure to do so will amount to a constructive failure to exercise the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Resolution

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 1001">I also note what was said in his SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 91 at [37] per Jacobson J: "It seems to me that the effect of the High Court's explanation of the statutory scheme is that the issues to which s 425 refers are particular factual aspects of an applicant's claim in respect of which the Tribunal is not persuaded when it extends to an applicant an invitation to attend the hearing: SZBEL at [34] --- [40]. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 884">I note also, as submitted by the first respondent, what is said in SZGUW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 91 (" SZGUW ") at [37] per Jacobson J: "It seems to me that the effect of the High Court's explanation of the statutory scheme is that the issues to which s 425 refers are particular factual aspects of an applicant's claim in respect of which the Tribunal is not persuaded when it extends to an applicant an invitation to attend the hearing: SZBEL at [34] --- [40]. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 550">What must be disclosed are those issues which are, "dispositive" of the review (SZBEL v Minister for Immigration [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 at [35] , or important to it (SZBEL at [47]), which have not been disclosed in the delegate's decision. 35. In SZGUW v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 91 , Jacobson J said, 37. It seems to me that the effect of the High Court's explanation of the statutory scheme is that the issues to which s 425 referred are particular factual aspects of an applicant's claim in respect of which the Tribunal is not persuaded when it extends to an applicant an invitation to attend the hearing: SZBEL at [34] --- [40]. 36. It is clear that in "some cases everything may be in issue; in others, the issues may be specific aspects of the material that is before the Tribunal: SZBEL at [36], [47]. " ( SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 91 (" SZGUW ")). In SZGUW Jacobson J at [37] said that he understood SZBEL to be authority for the proposition that "the issues to which s425 refers are particular factual aspects of an applicant's claim in respect of which the Tribunal is not persuaded when it extends to an applicant an invitation to attend the hearing: SZBEL at [34] --- [40]" . </sentence>
