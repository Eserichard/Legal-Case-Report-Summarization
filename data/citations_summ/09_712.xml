<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 963">I agree with Mr Reynolds that the applicant's argument that SZMOK should be limited to a particular factual situation that arose in that case must be rejected. (See also SZMHD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 712 at [56] per Jacobson J. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 934">In SZMHD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 712 Jacobson J stated at [55] that: ... the Full Court held [in SZMOK ] at [16]-[18] that s 422B(3) did not qualify the express statement in s 422B(1) that Div 4 contains an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 935">As the terms of s 424A make clear, the particulars required by s 424A(1) must be given in writing: s 424A(2). But s 424A(2A) creates an exception to s 424A(1) in that the Tribunal is not obliged to give written particulars of all information if the Tribunal gives clear particulars of the requisite information to the applicant at a hearing to which he has been invited under s 425. See also SZMHD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 712 at [11] to [15] per Jacobson J.  Indeed, if their contents were believed, they would, one might have thought, have been a relevant step towards rejecting, not affirming, the decision under review. 

 
Reference was thereafter made, with approval, to the observations of the Full Court of this Court in VAF , supra . In SZMHD, supra , Jacobson J observed that the question as to whether s 424A(1) is engaged is to be determined in advance of and independently of the Tribunal's reasoning on the facts of the particular case: [2009] FCA 712 at [46] , citing SZBYR , supra , at [17] and [22]. </sentence>
