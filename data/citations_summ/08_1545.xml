<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 13">The applicant further contends that the contraventions of the Act are serious and that the Court should order that the respondent pay a monetary penalty to the Commonwealth in respect of the contraventions pursuant to s 196(3) of the Act. The submissions of the parties have largely focused on the appropriate monetary penalty. In the course of the hearing, the question arose as to the respondent's capacity to pay a significant monetary penalty, having regard to his personal circumstances. Subsequent to the hearing, the parties jointly presented a further written submission as to the appropriate monetary penalty in the circumstances, and the terms upon which it is to be paid. It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate civil penalty. However, the Court has power to give effect to, and generally should give effect to, such an agreement provided it is satisfied that the penalty agreed upon is within the range of an appropriate penalty in all the circumstances: NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 ; Secretary, Department of Health and Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [33]- [38].

 REPRESENTATION
 Counsel for the First and Second Applicants: Mr J Nicholas 
 Solicitor for the First and Second Applicants: Shannon Walker, CFMEU 
 For the Respondent: Mr M Slabbert (by leave) 
 ORDERS
 
 (1) That in relation to the Respondent's contraventions of regulation 3.42(4) of the Fair Work Regulations 2009 (Cth) in relation to the First and Second Applicants the Respondent pay a penalty of $4,400. (2) That the penalty ordered to be paid under order (1) above be paid by the Respondent to the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, by 8 January 2011. There is no evidence that there has been any actual loss or damage suffered by the applicants. However, the fact of loss or damage must be considered in the context of the relevant statutory objective. If the relevant statutory objective is undermined that is of similar importance to actual loss and damage being suffered. [24] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 597">The precondition for the exercise of the power to order forfeiture has been met by the imposition on both respondents of pecuniary penalties. In Secretary, Department of Health and Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [60] - [72] Flick J considered the factors relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion to order forfeiture in considerable detail. His Honour accepted however, at [72], that the factors to be taken into account will vary according to the circumstances and added: 
 
 In the present proceeding there were no detailed submissions as to the manner in which s 54(3) was to be construed or applied. It is thus prudent to express no more than tentative views as to the ambit of the discretion there conferred. It is unnecessary to go beyond reaching a state of satisfaction in the present proceeding that the occasion for the exercise of the discretion has arisen and that it would be a judicial exercise of that discretion to order forfeiture.
