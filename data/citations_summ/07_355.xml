The Tribunal also indicated that it put such issues to the applicant at the Tribunal hearing in such a way as to put the applicant on notice of what may be dispositive issues in relation to the review of the decision of the delegate. (See SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152). No jurisdictional error is established on the basis contended for in ground three of the application or amended application. </sentence>
