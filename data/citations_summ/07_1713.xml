<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 530">Whether an issue must be raised with an applicant for s 425 purposes will "be a matter for assessment of fairness in each case". [13] To identify an issue too narrowly will give rise to "what in a s 424A context, the High Court has described as 'a circulus inextricabilis' of invitation and comment" --- and in the s 425 context, new hearings. [14] Identifying an issue requires attention to the reasoning of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152. In SZBEL the Tribunal disposed of the applicant's claims for three clearly articulated, simple reasons. [15] Two out of three of those reasons involved 'issues' or lines of reasoning that had not been raised with the applicant, either at the hearing or in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 834">The authorities appear to be (amongst others) SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 98 ALD 567 ; [2007] FCA 1100 (" SZHLM ") and possibly SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 941 , on the one side, and NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 (" NBKM ") and SZJHL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1713 (" SZJHL "). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 786">I comprehend that a similar approach was taken in SZJHL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1713 (" SZJHL "). Again a case where upon remittal, the Tribunal sent a " s 424A letter," but did not afford the applicant a second hearing. In SZJHL Finn J said (at [16]): "16. It was, in my view, perfectly plain --- and should have been such to the appellant --- that the entirety of his claims and his credibility generally were in issue in the review. Against this background it cannot properly be said that any further inconsistencies exposed in his s 424A answers relating to his claims or any greater doubts his answers engendered about his credibility raised new or unexpected issues for which, in fairness, a further opportunity for comment ought to have been provided. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 679">31 The appellants responded through their migration agent by commenting upon the items raised in the Tribunal's letter, but they offered no further evidence or submissions .... 32 In my view, therefore, there was no information provided to the reconstituted Tribunal which amplified the appellants' claims. There was, therefore, no material change in circumstances which had the potential to expand the scope of the relevant issues beyond those the subject of the first hearing and the first decision. As the appellants had already had the opportunity to provide evidence and make oral submissions as to those issues at the first hearing, the appellants were not, in the circumstances of this case, deprived of their rights under s 425 ...." SZJHL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1713 (" SZJHL "), also a case where upon remittal the Tribunal sent a " s.424A " letter, but the applicant was not given the opportunity of a second hearing in that case. The Minister submits that the same approach was taken in SZJHL as in NBKM . The Court at [16] said: "It was, in my view, perfectly plain --- and should have been such to the appellant --- that the entirety of his claims and his credibility generally were in issue in the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCAFC 84">9 Given that the appellant's case was remitted to the Tribunal for a further hearing, an issue might have arisen as to whether it was necessary for the Tribunal to issue a further invitation under s 425 to attend a hearing. We are inclined to the view that no such invitation was required; see NBKM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 at [15] - [32] and SZJHL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1713 at [16] ; cf SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 ; [2007] 98 ALD 567 at [34] . It is not necessary for us to decide that question however as the appellant was invited to the second hearing and did attend. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 219">In SZJHL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1713 , dated 9 November 2007 (" SZJHL "), Finn J at [16] stated that, where the entirety of an applicant's claims and his credibility were generally at issue in the review then any greater doubts that a second Refugee Review Tribunal may have about an applicant's credibility does not raise new or unexpected issues for which in fairness a further opportunity for comment ought to be provided. Finn J held that "To hold otherwise in the present case would be to give rise to what in a s.424A context, the High Court has described as a "a circulus inextricabilis" of invitation and comment: see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [20] " . </sentence>

" </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1841">18 To the extent that the appellants are submitting that the Tribunal was obliged to have further discussion with them or to provide another hearing, the Tribunal was under no such obligation by reason of s 424A(1) of the Act ( SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2007) 185 ALR 609 , SZJHL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1713). To the extent that the appellants are saying that the Tribunal had an obligation to notify them of its thought processes after receipt of the comments pursuant to the s 424A(1) letter, the Tribunal was under no obligation to do so ( SZBYR ; VAF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123).
