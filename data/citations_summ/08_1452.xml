<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 168">It is not in issue before me that such a claim in negligence could not have been set up in the proceedings giving rise to the Local Court judgment, since under the costs assessment procedures of the Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW) claims for negligence may not be addressed (see the judgment of Flick J in Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 ; (2008) 250 ALR 648 and an earlier judgment by me in Vaughan v Pagotto &amp; Ors [2006] FMCA 1287 ; (206) [2006] FMCA 1287 ; 202 FLR 321). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 86">Even if it could be said that a claim asserted by a corporation against a creditor could constitute a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand by an individual (and I was not referred to any authorities in support of such a proposition) and even if strictly speaking, the alleged counter-claim, set-off or cross demand could not have been set up in the action or proceedings in which the judgment or order was obtained due to its nature (compare Chen v Bannerman [2001] FCA 160 and Massih v Esber (2008) 250 ALR 648 ; [2008] FCA 1452) , the circumstances, including the delay in pursuing such claim, are relevant to the assessment of whether there is a viable case, or whether an apparently weak or borderline case is bona fide (see Re Bruce William Naghten &amp; Anor; Bruce William Naghten &amp; Anor v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1998] FCA 635). Having regard, insofar as possible on the material before the court, to the nature of the asserted case (which involves disputed factual allegations) and the significant delay in the commencement of any negligence proceedings, it has not been established that there is a reasonable probability of success in any such claim against AMT such that in justice this ought to be determined before bankruptcy proceedings in relation to Mr Gorczynski are allowed to continue ( Glew v Harrowell ).

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 899">The costs certificates were filed in the Local Court and thereupon took effect as a judgment of that Court pursuant to s.368(5) of the Legal Profession Act . A certificate of judgment was issued on 24 July 2009 in the amount of $31,947.26. That procedure is necessarily ex parte (see Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 (at [44], also Vaughan v Pagotto &amp; Ors [2006] FMCA 1287 ; (2006) 202 FLR 321 and Treadwell v Hickey [2006] FMCA 1727 ; (2006) 206 FLR 367). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 386">In Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 Flick J considered the various authorities which bore upon the question of whether a judgment entered pursuant to the provisions of the Legal Profession Act and the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules was one in which a cross claim for the division of development losses, which clearly exceeded the amount of assessed costs, could not be set up. "Could not have been set up" means could not have been set up as a matter of law Re Brink; Ex parte The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd [1980] FCA 78 ; (1980) 44 FLR 135 ; Re Vicini; Ex parte E A Sealey &amp; Co (1982) 64 FLR 323. In Massih Flick J notes: "The statutory phrase "must not be narrowed". A judgment debtor is "not to lie by with his cross-demand, but must prosecute it with due diligence": Re Brown, Ex parte Peisley Brothers (1892) 3 BC (NSW) 13 at 14 per Manning J. "A debtor having a claim against his or her creditor can not just stand by while judgment is obtained and later seek to use that claim to set aside a bankruptcy notice founded upon that judgment": Re Ling; Ex parte Ling v Commonwealth [1995] FCA 1410 ; (1995) 58 FCR 129 at 137 per Hill J.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 314">[9] The respondents note that were substantive judgments and costs judgments to be considered mutually exclusive, any bankruptcy notice issued as a consequence of any substantive judgment (via a costs order) could be undermined on every occasion where the costs order was assessed and registered as a judgment --- by the debtor raising the same claims that it failed on that were the subject of the substantive judgment. This would frustrate the due enforcement of the judgment and undermine the orders of the Court. Despite this, the respondents note the case of Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 ; (2008) 250 ALR 648.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 174">If Mr and Mrs Canty have prospects of obtaining a judgment against Agency Printing in the Supreme Court proceedings exceeding the amount of these costs, either on a cross-claim or even by way of costs on a successful defence, it is clear that such claims could not have been set up in the Local Court in answer to the registration of the costs certificate, since that proceeding did not provide any opportunity for a defence or cross-claim to be filed in the Local Court (see Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 , (2008) 250 ALR 648). Whether such prospects are established on the evidence before me today has been disputed by Agency Printing. However, it is unnecessary for me to examine this issue, including the significance of the subsequent history of the Supreme Court proceedings and McCallum J's orders on 3 March 2010. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 1006">If there is substance to a possible cross-claim in contract or negligence against Agostini Jarrett Pty Ltd, it would be enough to obtain the setting aside of the bankruptcy notice that it could be presented to the court as a 'prima facie case' with a 'fair chance of success' (see authorities extracted in Glew v Harrowell [2003] FCA 373 , (2003) 198 ALR 331). On current authorities, such a claim would be one that "he or she could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained" within s.40(1)(g) and s. 41 (7) of the Bankruptcy Act , since that proceeding was the ex-parte registration of the costs certificate (see Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 at [44], also Vaughan v Pagotto [2006] FMCA 1287 ; (2006) 202 FLR 321 and Treadwell v Hickey [2006] FMCA 1727 ; [2006] 206 FLR 367). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] NSWSC 896">64 The defendants have argued that Jazabas' unresolved chose in action against the plaintiff is the company's most valuable asset and it is a bona fide chose in action. They submit that they have evidence of a claim by against the plaintiffs for general damages, which provides a relevant defence to the proceeding and value of that claim exceeds the debt owed. They suggest that this claim is a cross-claim that they could not have raised in answer to the demand under section 459H, hence the appropriate time to raise it is at final hearing: per Flick J in Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 397">That he may have had an excuse for not bringing his own claim in Action 2363 of 2000 does not mean that his claim could not legally have been brought in those proceedings - Re Ling; Ex parte Ling v Commonwealth [1995] FCA 1410 ; (1995) 58 FCR 129 at 132 (Hill J). As Hill J said at 137 in that case: If machinery is available for [the] claim to be agitated as a cross-claim in the proceedings, even if application must be made in a timely way to another court or leave must be obtained, that application should be made or that leave sought. Otherwise the debtor will be bound by his or her conduct (see also Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 ; [2008] FCA 1452 ; (2008) 250 ALR 648 at [13] - [32] per Flick J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 97">They do not contend that the relevant "action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained" was the proceeding in the Tribunal. In that respect, the judgment of Flick J in Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 at [43] - [46] is against such a proposition. I previously considered this issue arising from the nature of costs assessment procedures in New South Wales, and more tentatively arrived at a similar opinion (see Treadwell v Hickey [2006] FMCA 1727 ; (2006) 206 FLR 367 at [25] - [27]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FMCA 4">There was discussion at the hearing as to the effect of Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 at [43] - [46], which supports the proposition that the District Court order was made in a different "action or proceeding" than the substantive proceedings before Barrett JJ, within the meaning of those words in s.40(1)(g). I accept that this might have significance when considering whether Mr Maher has a relevant " counter-claim, set-off or cross demand" which can be raised in answer to the bankruptcy notice. However, I do not consider that it provides an answer to Mr Maher's reliance upon r.42.7(2). This is because, as I shall explain, I consider that the rule would be given effect by both the Supreme Court and the District Court, regardless of whether technically the costs assessment application in the Supreme Court, or the filing of the costs certificates in the District Court, may be regarded as proceedings separate from the substantive proceeding which is still pending before Barrett J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 1985">But, whatever the meaning to be given to the term, it has to date been held that an action " must be something sounding in money ": Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd [1980] FCA 78 ; (1980) 44 FLR 135 at 138 per Lockhart J. See also: Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 at 85 per Henchman J. An application seeking declaratory relief as to an entitlement to a charge on the proceeds of property has thus been said not to be a " counter-claim, set-off or cross demand ": In re A Bankruptcy Notice [1934] 1 Ch 431. See also: Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 at [22] ---[24].  More recently, in Re Glew; Glew v Harrowell [2003] FCA 373 , 198 ALR 331 , His Honour Justice Lindgren reviewed the authorities and observed: 
 [9] There are authorities suggesting that Glew and Tresidder must satisfy me of the following interrelated and sometimes overlapping matters: 

 that they have a " prima facie case ", even if they do not adduce evidence which would be admissible on a final hearing making out that case ... that they have "a fair chance of success" or are "fairly entitled to litigate" the claim; ... and that they are advancing a "genuine" or "bona fide" claim ...
 
 It may be that the first and second formulations are intended to cover the same ground. In Brink [ Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd [1980] FCA 78 ; (1980) 44 FLR 135 , 30 ALR 433] Lockhart J treated (at ALR 438--- 9; FLR 141) the reference to a " prima facie case " ... as a reference to "a fair chance of success". ...
 [11] Plainly, in order to "satisfy" the Court for the purposes of par 40(1)(g), the debtor is not required to prove, as on a final hearing, the asserted entitlement to recover from the creditor. Accordingly, evidence tendered on an application to set aside is to be tested for admissibility, not as if the proceeding were one in which the debtor's claim was being finally determined, but by reference to the question whether the Court should be satisfied that the debtor has a claim deserving to be finally determined. 

 
Reference may also be made to Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 at [16] ---[19].  "I think it means a counter-claim which as things then stood the debtor could not set up in the action. "
 
 
Whether a claim " could not have [been] set up " is to be determined " by reference to legal considerations " and not " by reference to practicalities ": Re Ling; Ex parte Ling v Commonwealth [1995] FCA 1410 ; (1995) 58 FCR 129 at 132. See also: Smart v Esanda Finance Corp Ltd [2000] FCA 235 at [17] per Lee, Goldberg and Kenny JJ; Tzovaras v Nufeno Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1152 at [34] ---[35] per Jacobson J; and Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 at [28] ---[29]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 1425">In coming to my conclusion as to the lack of satisfaction I have taken into account the views expressed by Lindgren J in Re Glew; Glew v Harrowell [2003] FCA 373 at [9] and the commentary made upon that decision by Flick J in Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 at [18] and [19].
