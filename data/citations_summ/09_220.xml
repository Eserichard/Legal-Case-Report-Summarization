<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 14">Lastly, there was some contest before the primary judge as to the scope of "officer" in s 346(a). Different views have been expressed as to the scope of the words "member" and "officer" in the predecessor provision to s 346(a) of the Fair Work Act . The prohibited reason of a person being a "member" of an industrial association has been construed as confined to the status of membership: Australian Workers Union v BHP Iron-Ore Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 3 (2000) 106 FCR 482 at [66] ; Harrison v P&amp;T Tube Mills Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 220 (2009) 181 IR 162 at [298] . On the other hand, "member" has been construed to encompass activities of the member carried out as an incident of that person's membership of the union: Belandra at [216]. Perhaps a third view, largely consistent with the last, is that at least the normal incidents of union membership, including what might be described as ordinary union activity, are to be properly taken into account in determining whether the contravening conduct has taken place for a prohibited reason: National Union of Workers v Qenos Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 178 (2001) 108 FCR 90 at [124] .  I agree with the reasons of Dowsett J in Harrison v P T Tube Mills Proprietary Limited [2009] FCA 220 ; (2009) 181 IR 162 who said at 232 when describing a precursor to this section: 
 
 To the extent that this implies that s 793(1)(a) addresses conduct as well as union membership or standing as an officer or delegate, it is inconsistent with the observations made by Mason J in Bowling . Unfortunately, it seems that neither his Honour nor Marshall J was referred to that decision or to the decision of Merkel J in Ansett . I proceed upon the basis that ss 792(1)(a) and 793(1)(a) proscribe dismissal because of union membership or status as an officer or delegate, but not because of conduct. However conduct is relevant to the question in the way explained by Mason J in Bowling . 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 1079">68 I would have been inclined to the view that whether or not this was a formal direction of the board is not the issue; rather the issue is whether, by his conduct on receipt of the direction, Mr Purcell had unequivocally evinced an intention not to honour or be bound by the Contract. The question whether refusal to comply with a direction constitutes a repudiation needs to be judged having regard to all of the relevant factual circumstances. Whether or not the reasonableness or lawfulness of the direction is legitimately in dispute at the time of non-compliance may well be relevant to determining whether failure to comply with that direction evinces an intention no longer to be bound by the terms of the employment contract. (See, for example, Harrison v P &amp; T Tube Mills Pty Limited [2009] FCA 220 at [309] - [312], where Dowsett J found no basis for asserting that the plaintiff "refused to comply with the direction because he considered it to be unlawful, or that he asserted a construction of his contract of employment which was inconsistent with that impliedly advanced ... in giving the direction"; cf. Bechaz v Mariah Hovercraft Australia Pty Limited [2005] AIRC 252 where there was a live and contemporaneous dispute as to whether the defendant hovercraft company could direct the plaintiff to do cleaning and clearing tasks when he had been employed primarily as a boat builder or shipwright. )</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 102">Mr Harrison and the AMWU challenged the dismissal in a proceeding before the primary judge invoking the freedom of association provisions contained in Pt 16 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the Act"). His Honour dismissed that application. Mr Harrison and the AMWU have appealed from that order, the reasons for which were published in Harrison v P &amp; T Tube Mills Proprietary Limited [2009] FCA 220. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 488">The extent to which s.793(1)(a) encompasses the activities of a union official as a prohibited reason, as distinct from the fact of his or her holding union office, was recently discussed by Dowsett J in Harrison v P &amp; T Tube Mills Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 220 at [285] - [289]. His Honour considered the suggestion by Mason J in General Motors - Holden's Pty Ltd v Bowling (1976) 51 ALJR 235 at 241, that an employer might have difficulty disassociating a union official's troublesome union activities from the fact of his holding union office, as a reason for dismissing him. Dowsett J referred to Merkel J's discussion of this in Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical &amp; Services Union v Ansett Australia Ltd [2000] FCA 441 ; (2000) 175 ALR 173 at [72] , which suggested that Mason J's observations should be understood in a situation where the circumstances of the dismissal "are closely associated with the activities of the employee in that capacity" . Dowsett J also discussed later cases, and at [298] said that he would "proceed upon the basis that ss.792(1)(a) and 793(1)(a) proscribe dismissal because of union membership or status as an officer or delegate, but not because of conduct. However conduct is relevant to the question in the way explained by Mason J in Bowling" . </sentence>
