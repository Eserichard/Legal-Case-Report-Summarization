<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] VSC 330">43 AWB submits that ASIC has not provided the Court with sufficient evidence to carry out the balancing exercise. It has not provided the Court with the documents or any affidavit material other than as referred to above. AWB contrasts this approach with that undertaken by Goldberg J in P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd, [32] where the actual statements were examined to ascertain precisely what information it was claimed should not be disclosed in the public interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 779">When the return of the subpoena first came before the Court, ASIC objected to the production of the documents and transcripts for inspection on the ground of PII. At the time the basis for the objection that they tended to reveal the identity of informers to ASIC was not disclosed publicly in open hearing. I rejected ASIC's objection, in substance, on the basis that the identity of the informers, which ASIC was seeking to protect from disclosure, was already known within Multiplex and I set out my reasons in a confidential schedule to the published judgment: P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 1659 ; (2007) 65 ACSR 239. On 14 November 2007 I ordered that ASIC's application that the documents and transcripts were protected from production for inspection on the ground of PII be dismissed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] WASC 147">28 The procedure advocated by Alcoa was followed by Goldberg J in P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd [2007] FCA 1659 ; 65 ACSR 239. In that case the applicant brought representative proceedings against Multiplex for alleged failure by Multiplex to meet continuous disclosure obligations of the ASX when it encountered substantial delays and cost increases in the building of the Wembley National Stadium. It was alleged that Multiplex had information that was material to the share price and ought to have been disclosed to the ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 413">On 2 November 2007, I dismissed ASIC's application. My reasons for judgment were published publicly with a confidential appendix published only to ASIC: [2007] FCA 1659. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCAFC 123">5 A judge of this Court has rejected ASIC's objection to the production of a limited number of documents which ASIC says are covered by public interest immunity because they would tend to reveal the identity of an informer (or informers --- it is unnecessary to detail how many there were) employed by a company associated with the project ("the Company") who informed ASIC of the Wembley problems and Multiplex's alleged failure to disclose them: P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Limited [2007] FCA 1659. His Honour regarded as critical the fact that the identity of the informer(s) is already known within the Company at least to a limited number of senior people. Indeed, those people knew at the time that the informer was about to make disclosures to ASIC and provided legal representation for the informer.</sentence>
