<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 577">A deregistered company may be reinstated by ASIC if it is satisfied that the company should not have been deregistered: s.601AH(1) of the Corporations Act . Under s.601AH(2) , the Court also has the power to order ASIC to reinstate a deregistered company if it is satisfied that it is just to do so. Such a reinstatement application can be made by a person aggrieved by the deregistration or a former liquidator of the company. A person's status as a shareholder or director is not enough to establish standing as a person aggrieved: Piccoli Tesori Pty Ltd (Deregistered); Ex parte Bertuol [2006] FCA 462. In the absence of a person establishing themselves as an aggrieved party, it will generally be for the Court to order re-instatement: Pilarinos v Australian Securities and Investment Commission [2006] VSC 301. ASIC has the power to reinstate companies which have been inadvertently deregistered avoiding the expense of Court applications. However, ASIC exercises these reinstatement powers only when no dealings with the property of the company have been carried out and no third party has established a claim. If a third party's rights are involved, reinstatement requires a Court application. </sentence>

 GRAY J. 
 
 This is an application for an order that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") reinstate the registration of a company, pursuant to section 601AH(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The expression "person aggrieved" is an expression of wide import and is to be construed liberally. [8] It has been recognised that a person aggrieved may be a person who has been damaged or injured in a legal sense --- that is, a person who has a legal grievance. [9] The test is satisfied if an applicant's legal rights have been affected by the deregistration, and if it has a genuine grievance that the dissolution has affected its interests. [10] In GIS Electrical Pty Ltd v Melsom , [11] Steytler J (with whom Templeman and Miller JJ agreed), conducted a review of the relevant authorities and observed: 
 
 In Attorney-General of Gambia v N'Jie [1961] AC 617 at 634, the Privy Council (Lords Radcliffe, Denning and Guest) said: 
 "The words 'person aggrieved' are of wide import and should not be subjected to a restrictive interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] VSC 37">70 Before ASIC could be divested of the car (other than by forfeiture under the Act), the company would have to be reinstated under s601AH of the Corporations Act . If ASIC is not prepared to reinstate under s601AH(1) , [39] then an application would have to be made to the Supreme or Federal Court for reinstatement under s601AH(2). Mr Selcuk's status as a shareholder [40] , or as a director, [41] is insufficient to give him standing to make a deregistration application as "a person aggrieved by the deregistration". Furthermore, the court's power to reinstate even on the application of an aggrieved person (such as the company itself) is entirely discretionary. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] NSWSC 1341">11 In Brereton v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 651 Finkelstein J held that a shareholder of a solvent company who stands to lose his or her capital has a sufficient basis for standing (at [4]), and he expressed the opinion that there was a strong argument in favour of holding that a former director of a solvent company would also have standing (at [5]), though he found it unnecessary to resolve that question. The authorities to which his Honour's attention was drawn on this point were decided in the 1980s, and his attention does not appear to have been drawn to more recent cases (see Butterworths' Australian Corporations Law: Principles and Practice (looseleaf), vol 2, [5.6.0 555], note 20) including the decision of Young CJ in Eq in Casali v Crisp , which has been followed in this and other courts ( Euphron Pty Ltd (in liq) v Hunter Valley Piggery Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 543 at [12] ; Melluish v Underwood Development Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 429 at [6] ; Warton v Harris [2005] NSWSC 1168 ; (2005) 56 ACSR 122 at [4] ; Jones v 3R Gas Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 290 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 450 at [8] ; Piccoli Tesori Pty Ltd (Deregistered); Ex parte Bertuol [2006] FCA 462 ; (2006) 151 FCR 109 at [23] ; Herbert v Nozala Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1437 at [38] ; Callegher v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] FCA 482 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 438 at [50] and [53]; Middleton Nominees Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corp [2007] FCA 845 at [6] ).</sentence>
