<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 378">7. The distinction sought to be made by the applicant is without any authority and is contrary to authority, taking just two examples: (a) In SZANH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1280 , Sackville J held that country information pertaining to document fraud fell within the exception (although it had been used to make it easier for the Tribunal to reject documents advanced by the applicant in that case). (b) In SZESF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 6 , Stone J determined that general country information (in the form of photographs) fell within the exception of s 424A(3)(a) even though it had been used to discredit the applicant in that case. 8. The applicant has also "further submitted" that the Tribunal was bound by procedural fairness to put to the applicant the "actual inconsistencies" between the country information and the applicant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 1888">The application for a protection visa was refused by a delegate on 19 September 2000, and this decision was affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal in a decision handed down on 5 June 2007. An earlier decision of the Tribunal handed down on 18 February 2003 was set aside by order of Stone J, who found breaches of s.424A (see SZESF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 6). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 656">In the event that there had been some prior provision of this information to the department, authorities such as Goo v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 391 , SZCJD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 609 , SZESF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 6 indicate that the repetition of such information at the Tribunal hearing brings it within the reach of s.424A(3)(b).</sentence>
