("tillmanns"), was a wholesale and retail butcher carrying on business in canberra and queanbeyan. the first-named respondent, the australasian meat industry employees' union ("the union") was an organization of employees including employees of wholesale and retail butchers and employees in abattoirs. the third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents were the president, secretary and two organizers of the union respectively. in december 1977 two of the respondents entered tillmannss' shop in queanbeyan and asked to see the employees. the request was refused by tillmanns' managing director because it was neither smoko nor lunchtime. the union retaliated by imposing a black ban upon tillmanns' shops. at that time canberra abattoir pty. ltd. ("canberra abattoir"), a company which conducted an abattoir in the australian capital territory, held for tillmanns thirty-two cattle awaiting slaughter and the carcasses of twenty head of cattle and seventeen pigs. as a result of the black ban by the union the live cattle were not slaughtered for some weeks and the carcasses were released to tillmanns only about a week later to avoid deterioration. the appellant instituted an action in the federal court of australia seeking an injunction and damages under ss. 80 and 82 in relation to s. 45d of the trade practices act 1974 ("the act ") alleging that the respondents acted in concert to prevent supplies of meat to tillmanns in breach of s. 45d of the act . the trial judge declined to find that the respondents' conduct had the relevant effect and refused to award damages or to grant an injunction. he stated in his judgment, inter alia, that the plaintiff (appellant) was not entitled to argue that the conduct complained of would be likely to cause substantial loss where the means of proving whether in fact it did cause substantial loss were in its power. the appellant appealed to the full court of the federal court of australia against this judgment claiming that an injunction should have been ordered.  held: per curiam</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp25.20" type=cited from="[1979] FCA 85">the appeal against the first, third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents should be upheld, the cross appeal of those respondents should be dismissed and the appellant should be granted injunctive relief against the above-named respondents because: (1) the appellant was entitled to seek relief on the ground that the relevant conduct of the respondents, if continued, would or would be likely to have the effect of causing substantial loss or damage to the appellant's business.</citphrase>

But the trend is towards acceptance of the test (a recent example is FTC v Whole Foods 548 F3d 1028 (2008) at 1038) not only in merger cases, but wherever it is necessary for competition purposes to define the boundaries of a relevant market (see eg Kentucky Speedway, LLC v National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc., 588 F3d 908 (2009)). Notwithstanding the criticisms, or in spite of it, the hypothetical monopolist test has gained currency in Australia: see eg Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2009] FCAFC 166 ; [2009] FCAFC 166 ; (2009) 262 ALR 160 at [353] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 826 at 204, 209; Re Qantas Airways Limited [2004] ACompT 9 at 66-67; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Medical Association Western Australia Branch Inc [2003] FCA 686 ; (2003) 199 ALR 423 at 480. 17.3 Vertical integration 
 Vertical integration raises difficult issues about market definition and the identification of market participants. Assume, for example, that technological interdependence is the cause of integration. The Tribunal has provided to the parties Reasons for Determination. The reasons will be published once the parties have had an opportunity to consider whether any parts should be redacted for reasons of commercial confidentiality. AUSTRALIAN COMPETITION TRIBUNAL

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 166">50 The conclusion I have reached is consistent with the decision of Allsop J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 826 ; (2006) ATPR 42-123 , where his Honour said at 45,191:
 Thus, the prohibition involves a subjective purpose concerning the basal economic concept around which this part of the Act works --- the market. Thus, if it were the case that a party included a provision in a contract for the avowed purpose of substantially lessening, indeed stifling entirely, competition (using that word in its general English meaning, not by reference to s 45(3)) in a location or area which could not be said to be a market for the goods in question ascertained by relevant analysis, but with no other wider purpose, there may be no contravention of the Act.  464 Thirdly, he thought that because s 45 was a penal provision it ought to be construed in accordance with the observations of Allsop J in ACCC v Liquorland [2006] FCA 826 ; [2006] ATPR 42-123 , at 45,184 [45]:
 using the ordinary rules of statutory construction and interpretation, but recognising that if as a matter of last resort, after those rules are applied, the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful such ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject.  22 Indeed, there is good reason to construe the provisions in Pt IV of the TPA so that those who might engage in such conduct should readily be aware of the quality of the conduct and the possible consequences of doing so, before being liable for it. That is more so where the alternative limb of ss 45(2)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) is engaged, namely that the provision has, or may have, the impugned effect (as distinct from its purpose). The effect or likely effect of such a provision is a matter which is more readily appreciated by the parties to the contract, including the party who did not know of (and perhaps could not know of) the purpose of other contracting parties in including the provision, and so the same considerations do not apply. See generally the observations of Allsop J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 826 ; (2006) ATPR 42-123 at 45,184-45,185. 18 Delete any reference to "NSD 1330" and insert "NSD 1339" in lieu thereof. I certify that the preceding three (3) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Corrigendum to the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mansfield and the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justices Dowsett and Lander.

 THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 

 
 1. The appeal be dismissed. 2. 20 The appellants then addressed the objects of the TPA, and in particular Part IV. Section 2 sets out the objects of the TPA. It is "to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and provision for consumer protection". Hence they contended, in a general sense, such litigation should be given a broad construction of its constituent sections: Devenish v Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 7 ; (1991) 172 CLR 32 at 43-44 per Mason CJ and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 826 ; (2006) ATPR 42-123 at 45,185 per Allsop J. 346 The trial Judge referred himself to the principles for the identification of markets. His Honour proceeded upon the basis that markets are not defined in the abstract but are defined for the purpose of analysing the processes of competition in regard to the allegations made in any particular case. He adopted a statement by Allsop J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 826 ; [2006] ATPR 42-123 (at 45,243 [429]) ( ACCC v Liquorland ):
 Market definition is not an exact physical exercise to identify a physical feature of the world; nor is it the enquiry after the nature of some form of essential existence. Rather, it is the recognition and use of an economic tool or instrumental concept related to market power, constraints on power and the competitive process which is best adapted to analyse the asserted anti-competitive conduct.  366 The trial Judge also referred to a comment by Sir Alan Neale, The Antitrust Laws of the United States of America (2nd ed, Cambridge University Press, 1970), at 121, which was cited by Heydon J in his writing and by Allsop J in ACCC v Liquorland [2006] FCA 826 ; [2006] ATPR 42-123 at [443] :
 The court will take as the market, for the purposes of deciding cases, just that market which the concern itself takes for its field of activity: if a firm shows an intent to exclude competition from that field it will be assumed that the field sufficiently describes a market --- for otherwise what would be the point of the effort to exclude? </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 580">[309] If Dr Nicholson's report is to be understood as expressing opinions on the law in some instances, that was not a basis for rejecting it. He relied on the judgment of Sackville J in Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality Group Pty Ltd , [310] which referred in turn to the judgment of Lindgren J in All State Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (No 33) . [311] Mr Broadfoot relied also on the judgment of French J in Sampi v Western Australia , [312] which referred to the judgment of Allsop J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland ( Australia) Pty Ltd. [313] In light of these authorities, he submitted that the theory of governance, in which Dr Nicholson is an expert, provides a technique of thinking or an analytical tool or basis for comparison which may inform and assist the Tribunal in its evaluative task. His report should not be criticised for putting an argument as opposed to giving an opinion for its subject matter is not about a technical matter such as the nature of a chemical reaction but is more akin to an analysis from the perspective of a social science. Such an analysis is essentially argumentative but not less attended with intellectual rigour, honesty and a willingness to engage in discourse.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1573">4 The Code has been amended from time to time since its initial promulgation. The general scheme of the Code, set against the background of the regulation of migration agents, is to regulate their conduct for the benefit and protection of the public. By the Migration Act , s 303 , MARA is given the authority to discipline migration agents for, amongst other things, non-compliance with the Code. Of course, the approach to the construction of the delegated legislation should recognise the serious consequences for the migration agent of a finding of misconduct. In that sense the provisions can be described as penal: Hanna v Migration Agents Registration Authority [1999] FCA 1657 ; (1999) 94 FCR 358 at 363. However, as I said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 826 ; [2006] ATPR 42-123 at [45] - [48] , the meaning of a penal provision is to be ascertained using the ordinary rules of statutory construction and interpretation, but recognising that if, as a matter of last resort after those rules are applied, the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful, such ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject. What is to be rejected is an approach which, because the provision is penal, employs a literal analysis with an eye to the discernment of textual ambiguity through finely spun distinction: see also Pearce DC and Geddes RS, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (5 th ed, Butterworths, 2001) at p 232 [9.8].</sentence>

 JUDGE: SACKVILLE J DATE OF ORDER: 27 JULY 2007 WHERE MADE: SYDNEY 

 THE COURT DIRECTS THAT: 

 
 1. Optus, on or before 24 August 2007, file and serve draft Short Minutes of Order disposing of the Cross-Claim. 2409 Thirdly, as I have already noted, s 45 is a penal provision. Accordingly, the Court approaches its construction:
 
 'using the ordinary rules of statutory construction and interpretation, but recognising that if as a matter of last resort, after those rules are applied, the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful such ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject'. 
 

 Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 826 ; [2006] ATPR 42-123 , at 45,184 [45], per Allsop J. As Allsop J pointed out in that case (at 45,185 [47]), this does not mean that the Court adopts a literal analysis ' with an eye to the discernment of textual ambiguity through finely spun distinctions '. However:
 
 'provisions of the [ TP Act ] which are intended to govern and effect business decisions and commercial behaviour should, if such a construction is fairly open, be construed in such a way as to enable the business person, before he or she acts, to know with some certainty whether or not the act contemplated is lawful'. 
 

 ACCC v Liquorland [2006] ATPR, at 45,185 [48], citing Melway Publishing Pty Ltd v Robert Hicks Pty Ltd (2001) 205 CLR 1 , at 10-11 [8], per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.  1763 Seven's Closing Submissions sometimes give the impression of approaching the definition of the relevant markets as a separate issue, largely distinct from the other issues in the case. Yet the parties are agreed that markets are not defined in the abstract, but for the purpose of analysing the processes of competition relevant to the allegations of anti-competitive conduct made in the particular case. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Liquorland (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 826 ; [2006] ATPR 42-123 , Allsop J made the point, supported by copious citation of authority, that (at 45,243 [429]):
 
 'Market definition is not an exact physical exercise to identify a physical feature of the world; nor is it the enquiry after the nature of some form of essential existence. Rather, it is the recognition and use of an economic tool or instrumental concept related to market power, constraints on power and the competitive process which is best adapted to analyse the asserted anti-competitive conduct'. </sentence>
