<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 743">I note that no issue was raised with the applicant by the Tribunal about the genuineness of his conduct in Australia and its relationship to s.91R(3) of the Act. However in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2007) 163 FCR 304 ; [2007] FCA 942 at [25] Buchanan J did not accept the suggestion that the Tribunal has a positive obligation to alert an applicant to the fact that it might conclude that it should disregard his conduct in Australia (at [25]), although his Honour went on to state (at [33]) that it seemed to be an essential premise of s.91R(3) that the applicant have a proper opportunity to satisfy the Tribunal that the conduct in Australia said to be relevant was not engaged in just for the purposes of strengthening a claim to be a refugee. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 489">The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in questions. " (emphasis added in original) The applicant proceeds to refer to SZILQ v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 942 ; (2007) 163 FCR 304 and then to SZHKA v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCAFC 138 ; (2008) 172 FCR 1. SZBEL related to a finding by the Tribunal contrary to views expressed by the delegate which the Tribunal had never told the applicant was a matter in issue. SZILQ related to a second Tribunal failing to hold a second hearing when "an additional element emerged in respect of which the appellant had not been given an opportunity to give evidence and present arguments at an oral hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 841">No error can be found in the above reasoning of the Federal Magistrate. As his Honour noted, the Tribunal was obliged to make findings about the appellant's conduct in Australia, before considering the effect of s 91R(3). This was not a case where the Tribunal failed to raise the 'issue' (in the SZBEL sense) of s 91R(3) with the appellant at the hearing (Cf: SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 ; [2007] FCA 942 ; (2007) 163 FCR 304 ; SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 911). The Tribunal's findings were open to it, that the appellant's Falun Gong activities in Australia were for the sole purpose of enhancing a claim to a protection visa. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 290">Insofar as this might be said to raise a more general issue of whether the Tribunal was obliged to have a further hearing to put dispositive issues to the applicant as considered in SZBEL , that is not made out on the material before the Court. The further material put before the Tribunal by the applicant addressed matters raised at the hearing. It was open to the Tribunal to consider and make the adverse findings that it did. It has not been established that there was any unfairness in the Tribunal referring to this information. The applicant was put on notice in the hearing of dispositive issues, including the Tribunal's concern about significant inconsistencies as to when and what claims he made. It has not been established that this was a case in which a further hearing was required (see SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 per Buchanan J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 217">A tribunal is required to give an applicant a proper opportunity to satisfy it that the conduct engaged in was not engaged in just for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee ( SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 at [33] per Buchanan J). However, there was no evidence before the Court, nor any particularised complaint by the Applicant, that the Tribunal failed to give the Applicant a proper opportunity to satisfy it that the conduct engaged in was not engaged in just for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee. Nor does a fair reading of the Tribunal's decision record suggest so. </sentence>

Cases where the Tribunal intends to rely upon additional material to which the applicant has not had an opportunity to respond. (See SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942). Cases where the matter is remitted to a re-hearing before a different member. (See SZHKA ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 7">In relation to the additional ground of review the Minister relevantly submits: The applicants contend that this raises a similar issue to that identified in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2007) 163 FCR 304 ; [2007] FCA 942. It is noted that SZILQ was decided on the basis that an entirely new sur place claim was put before the Tribunal for the first time after the matter had been remitted by consent to a differently constituted Tribunal. The appellant sought a new hearing in order to address (inter alia) issues raised by the new conduct which included the appellant's attendance at Hillsong Church services during his detention at Villawood: at [13] --- [15] and [32] --- [33]). The applicants also assert a breach of s.360 of the Migration Act because of the failure by the Tribunal to put to the applicants at a hearing information obtained from a person known to the applicants which is contained in the confidential exhibits envelope. The applicants rely upon the decision of the Federal Court in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 942 at [32] where Buchanan J said: However, in my view, the principles stated in SZBEL about the operation of s 425(1) of the Act are nevertheless of some relevance to the issues which arise for consideration in this appeal. On the authority of SZBEL , where a matter is one of 'the issues arising in relation to the decision under review' s 425(1) of the Act requires an invitation to appear 'to give evidence and present arguments relating to' the issue. The question of the appellant's motivation was obviously an issue in the case because, although he evidently wished his claimed practice of Christianity in Australia to be taken into account, s 91R(3) required his conduct in Australia to be disregarded unless he satisfied the RRT about his motivation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 44">We need two weeks time to prepare a detailed statement for the applicant. We therefore request that an adjournment of hearing is granted for two weeks. We refer to the Federal Court decision in the matter of SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 in which His Honor Buchanan J held that an applicant must be afforded opportunity to make his or her claims. We would like to submit that we would not kill the tribunal's time unnecessarily and we understand that there is a thirty days time limit on every protection visa application. Unless there is anything life threatening or act of god, we would not ask for any more adjournments in this matter. Counsel cited the judgment of Buchanan J in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 ; (2007) 163 FCR 304 , in support of the proposition that a Tribunal must always warn an applicant about the provisions of s.91R(3) where he or she presents evidence about conduct in Australia in support of refugee claims. However, his Honour expressly approved the reasoning of my judgment in that matter at first instance, which held to the contrary (see his Honour at [24] and [25], upholding [2007] FMCA 483 at [50] - [58]). His Honour did accept the appellant's argument, not put to me at first instance, that the raising of new claims of Australian activities after a remitter to the Tribunal gave rise to an obligation on the Tribunal under s.425 to agree to a request by the applicant's solicitor that the applicant should be given the opportunity to attend a further hearing by the reconstituted Tribunal (see [33]). That point has no relevance to the present case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 1715">I note that in SZKTI the Full Court also canvassed the possibility that after the Tribunal had obtained additional information it may be obliged by s.425(1) of the Act to issue a further invitation to the applicant to a hearing to address new issues arising from that information, even if that information had been put to the applicant in a s.424A letter. While their Honours saw " some force " in this argument, they found it unnecessary to decide the question as the appeal succeeded based on the Tribunal's failure to follow the procedures in ss.424(2) and (3) and 424B (but see SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 ; (2007) 163 FCR 304 and SZJYA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) and Another [2008] FCA 911 ; (2008) 102 ALD 598). In the absence of any submissions on this issue and given my findings on s.424A it is not necessary to decide this question, despite the fact that it is raised by the fact that the Tribunal obtained information from the Consulate General and the PSB after the hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 1533">But, in any event, the way in which this matter was raised before me was on account of unfairness said to be related to the fact that it was not a matter that had been dealt with by the delegate of the Minister in the original determination. It was a matter that arose for the first time at the second hearing. Effectively the complaint was that the applicant did not have the opportunity to answer to a matter that concerned the Tribunal but which was not raised before the delegate. Reliance was placed upon the High Court decision of SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942. That was a decision of a single Judge of the Federal Court allowing a review (and an appeal from a Federal Magistrate dismissing the review) on account of a failure to allow an applicant to give evidence and make arguments in relation to a finding by the Tribunal pursuant to s.91R(3) of the Act that he had begun to practise Christianity in Australia in order to advance his claim for a protection visa. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1200">7 Her Honour found that this was not a case in which an additional element to the appellant's claim emerged in post-hearing material, and which thereby required a second hearing (cf SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 ; (2007) 163 FCR 304 at 315). In relation to the letters that the appellant submitted after the hearing, her Honour said, at [53]:
 .... the evidence, including the letters of support, went directly to the issue of whether the applicant's claim to be a member and official of the [Awami League] could be believed. Section 425 does not require the Tribunal to put the applicant on notice of its concerns about the weight to be given to evidence provided in support of his claims in such circumstances or to put to him the manner in which concerns about his credibility may impact on the Tribunal's assessment of corroborative material. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCAFC 138">104 The conclusions I have reached in relation to the first submission and the alternative submission are consistent with the views expressed by single Judges of this Court in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 ; (2007) 163 FCR 304 and SBRF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 101 ALD 559 ; [2008] FCA 712. Insofar as Cowdroy J was expressing a contrary conclusion in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 ; (2007) 98 ALD 567 at 574 [34] ); [2007] FCA 1100 , I would respectfully disagree with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 834">Further, I specifically understood that the applicant was not pressing in this case what was said in SZHLM at [34]: "There is a further consideration. The original decision of the Tribunal, having been set aside had 'no operative effect': see SZILQ [2007] FCA 942 The reconstituted Tribunal was required to carry out its statutory functions as if the first hearing had not taken place. The Tribunal's duty required it to seek further information under s 424A(1) and in the absence of a finding in favour of the appellant was required to invite the appellant 'to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issuing arising in relation to the decision under review' pursuant to s 425 of the Act: see Applicant NAFF of 2002 221 CLR at [26] ---[27]. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 786">During the course of the hearing, Mr Mitchell fairly (given that the applicant was unrepresented before the Court) raised one possible issue that the Court should consider in light of SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 (" SZILQ ") at [32], SZHLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 (" SZHLM ") at [34], and NBKM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 (" NBKM ") at [32]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FCA 911">36 The appellant argued that the tribunal's reasons do not suggest that she had been invited to give evidence or present arguments as to whether she had engaged in attending the Local Church in Australia either for the purposes of bolstering her claim for a protection visa or as going to her credibility generally. She relied on what Buchanan J had held in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 942 ; (2007) 163 FCR 304 at 315-316 [32] - [33] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FMCA 679">I should just note that in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 the Court found that a "reconstituted" Tribunal made an adverse credibility finding which was not based on evidence taken directly from the applicant. It had not put any written questions to the applicant which may have elicited responses, which then may have provided the foundation for an adverse finding. Yet in its findings that Tribunal commenced its reasoning by rejecting the applicant's claims on the basis that the applicant in that case was not a credible witness. In these circumstances the Court found that the Tribunal was required to hold a hearing to enable such evidence to be taken.  The Minister also submitted that there is at least one aspect of the reasoning in SZHLM that is directly inconsistent with Full Court authority which is binding on this Court. At [34]: "There is a further consideration. The original decision of the Tribunal, having been set aside had 'no operative effect': see SZILQ [2007] FCA 942.

<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FCA 890">24 The overall credibility of the appellant in any event was always a matter that was in issue, based on the delegate's decision and from the course of the proceedings in the tribunal.

In my opinion the grounds raised in the amended application fail and were correctly rejected by her Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FMCA 550">It seems to me that the effect of the High Court's explanation of the statutory scheme is that the issues to which s 425 referred are particular factual aspects of an applicant's claim in respect of which the Tribunal is not persuaded when it extends to an applicant an invitation to attend the hearing: SZBEL at [34] --- [40]. 36. It is also clear, from SZILQ v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 942 [35], that an issue that arises after the hearing has to be put to the applicant. 37. It may be conceded that both the first and second Tribunals made it clear that they had doubts about the applicant's claims because his family did not accompany him to Australia in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2008] FMCA 452">Since the hearing of this matter, it has come to the Court's attention that there have been three recent additions which address the issue of whether a reconstituted Tribunal is required to hold its own hearing. This issue was addressed in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 per Buchannan J at [32] handed down on 27 June 2007: SZHLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 per Cowdry J at [34] handed down on 23 October 2007 and NBKM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 per Siopis J at [32] handed down 13 September 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] FMCA 228">During the hearing in this Court, I raised with Mr Mitchell the impact of the recent decisions in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 at [32] per Buchannan J, SZHLM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1100 at [34] per Cowdroy J and NBKM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1413 at [32] per Siopis J. At the end of the hearing leave was granted to the parties to file supplementary submissions addressing this issue. Mr Mitchell complied with this request and filed supplementary submissions on 12 December 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2008] FMCA 191">In SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 (27 June 2007) Buchanan J held that, at [24]: I do not accept ... that there was a positive obligation on the RRT to put the allegation [that he had engaged in the practice of Christianity in Australia to strengthen his claim to be a refugee] to him. Ultimately the burden under s.91R(3) lay on the appellant to satisfy the RRT about his motivation before the RRT was permitted to pay any regard to his conduct in Australia ... having regard to the terms of s.91R(3). It was ultimately a matter for the appellant to satisfy the RRT about his motivation. 
And at [31]:
 
 The RRT was not obliged to draw it to the appellant's attention or to warn him that it would disregard material about his conduct in Australia if he did not satisfy the RRT that the reason for the conduct was genuine. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2008] FMCA 133">Mr Gibian in his written submissions acknowledges that s.422B of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act") applies in this matter but contends that the Tribunal failed to comply with s.425(1) of the Act as it did not identify to the applicant any issue critical to its decision or advise of any adverse conclusion: Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) FCR 576 at [591]-[592] and SZBEL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63. It is submitted that jurisdictional error would have occurred if the Tribunal failed to comply with s.425(1) in accordance with the reasoning in SZBEL notwithstanding the operation of s.422B: SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 at [35] .  Mr Gibian submits that the Tribunal made two determinations that were not causally open to it regarding the delegate's decision, and did not identify those matters dealt with in its determination as issues arising in the review: The applicant's participation in Falun Gong activities in Australia may have been simply to give the impression of a commitment to Falun Gong. The statements of Falun Gong practitioners did not establish that the applicant had a commitment to Falun Gong. The delegate's decision was based upon an alleged failure by the applicant to provide letters of support or other evidence from organisations in Australia (CB 47-48). The applicant submits that she did as much as could reasonably be expected to satisfy that this: by providing statements from five fellow practitioners who had observed her practicing Falun Gong and confirming that she was a genuine follower (CB 76-81); three witnesses attended her Tribunal hearing (transcript, p.1); the Tribunal did not suggest that a witness could have been fooled and did not suggest to the witness that they may have been fooled (transcript, pp.2-35). 
This denied the applicant the opportunity to give evidence and make submissions about this matter. The Tribunal did not identify to the applicant that an issue which arose was whether her Falun Gong activities in Australia were done to strengthen her claim for refugee status. While the Tribunal is not required to draw s.91R(3) of the Act to the applicant's attention ( SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 at [31] ), Mr Gibian argues that she should be afforded the opportunity to give evidence and make submissions on that central question. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] FMCA 4">This was not a case in which an additional element to the applicant's claim emerged in post-hearing material in respect of which he had not been given an opportunity to give evidence and present arguments at an oral hearing (see SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 at [31] ). Rather the evidence, including the letters of support, went directly to the issue of whether the applicant's claim to be a member and official of the AL could be believed. Section 425 does not require the Tribunal to put the applicant on notice of its concerns about the weight to be given to evidence provided in support of his claims in such circumstances or to put to him the manner in which concerns about his credibility may impact on the Tribunal's assessment of corroborative material. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] FMCA 163">An example of a case where a further hearing was required is that which is described in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) FCA 942 , and that was a case relied upon by Mr Ower who appeared on behalf of the applicant before me. The particular circumstances of that case which gave rise to the need for the second hearing are conveniently set out at [32] of that decision, which is a decision of Buchanan J.  I am not sure, however, if the decision of Cowdroy J in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) FCA 1100 takes the principle further than those cases, when referring to SZILQ at [33] and [34]. In [34] in particular, Cowdroy J says this: There is a further consideration. The original decision of the Tribunal, having been set aside had 'no operative effect': see SZILQ (2007) FCA 942 . The reconstituted Tribunal was required to carry out its statutory functions as if the first hearing had not taken place. The Tribunal's duty required it to seek further information under section 424A(1) and in the absence of a finding in favour of the appellant was required to invite the appellant 'to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issue arising in relation to the decision under review' pursuant to section 425 of the Act: see Applicant NAFF of 2002 221 CLR at 26 to 27. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2008] FMCA 20">Alternatively, the applicant's written submissions allege a breach of s.425 of the Act, in that the Tribunal was required to invite him "to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review". The applicant alleges that the Tribunal based its decision on specific issues which were not put to him for comment. Mr Turner submits that this failure denied the applicant procedural fairness: SZBEL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; SZIQL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2007] FMCA 2037">In an appeal from my judgment in SZILQ , Buchanan J did not doubt my opinion that a hearing held by the Tribunal as previously constituted could satisfy the requirements of s.425. However, he held that new written evidence given to the Tribunal about the appellant's conduct in Australia had the effect that "an additional element then emerged, in respect of which the appellant had not been given an opportunity to give evidence and present arguments at an oral hearing. In those circumstances the obligations under s 425(1) were not fully met" (see SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 at [32] - [33]). I note that an application by the Minister for special leave to appeal to the High Court from this decision has been filed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2007] FMCA 2091">Mr Turner referred the Court to the recent decision of Buchanan J of the Federal Court of Australia in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 (" SZILQ ") as support for the proposition that s.425(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (" the Act ") requires the Refugee Review Tribunal to invite the Applicant to give evidence and present arguments relating to issues arising in relation to the decision under review. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2007] FMCA 1930">The applicant referred also to SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 at [37] that the applicant be given a proper opportunity to satisfy the statutory test in s.91R(3) and the obligation in s.425(1) to invite an applicant to a hearing to give evidence and present arguments about issues arising in relation to the decision under review. 
In the present matter, s.425 was complied with (CB 47, 84) and the applicant had a full opportunity to satisfy the statutory test in s.91R(3) in the course of hearings before the delegate and two reviews before the Tribunal (CB 53-78, 115-141). The Court does not find a denial of procedural fairness. Ground three is rejected. Conclusion
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs30" from="[2007] FCA 1971">14 Nor that there has been any breach of procedural fairness. In reaching that conclusion it is considered that the decision of Buchanan J in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) FCA 942 is distinguishable. His Honour in that decision concluded that s 91R(3) of the 1958 Act did not impose any positive obligation on the Tribunal to put allegations to the Applicant. His Honour observed:
 
 [24] There is, in my view, some substance in the suggestion in the first ground of appeal that there was no apparent evidentiary foundation for the firmly adverse conclusion about the appellant's motivation and the confident denouncement of his claimed religious beliefs.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs31" from="[2007] FMCA 1740">SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 was referred to in support of a submission that the interaction between s.91R(3) and s. 425 (1) meant that the obligation to give procedural fairness was not "foreclosed by s.422B" . As the rules of natural justice do not require a decision maker to disclose what they are intending to decide in order to give the parties a further opportunity (to respond), the Court holds that the applicant was not denied procedural fairness by not being offered a further hearing to respond to such issues. The correct question

<sentence id="cs32" from="[2007] FCA 1100">33 In SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 the appellant sought a second Tribunal hearing after the Tribunal's initial decision had been quashed and the proceedings had been remitted to the Tribunal. The appellant provided material to the second Tribunal which included a testimonial from a local pastor attesting to the appellant's religious observance in Australia. The Tribunal denied the appellant's request for a further hearing. 34 There is a further consideration. The original decision of the Tribunal, having been set aside had 'no operative effect': see SZILQ [2007] FCA 942. The reconstituted Tribunal was required to carry out its statutory functions as if the first hearing had not taken place. The Tribunal's duty required it to seek further information under s 424A(1) and in the absence of a finding in favour of the appellant was required to invite the appellant ' to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issuing arising in relation to the decision under review' pursuant to s 425 of the Act: see Applicant NAFF of 2002 221 CLR at [26] ---[27]. </sentence>

She went on to refer to the decision in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [12] , an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court, where Buchanan J held, on the authority of SZBEL, that where a matter is one of the issues arising in relation to the decision under review, s. 425(1) requires an invitation to appear to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issue.

[13]  
 
 50. In respect of each part of the applicants' first ground, these issues related to a potential finding under s. 91R(3). It is for the applicant to satisfy the Tribunal that the conduct was not engaged in for the purpose of strengthening his refugee claims and there is no requirement that a potential finding under s. 91R(3) must be put to the applicant during the hearing. In SZILQ, Buchanan J held at [24]: 
 
 
 I do not accept, however, that there was a positive obligation on the RRT to put the allegation to him. Ultimately the burden under s 91R(3) lay on the applicant to satisfy the RRT about his motivation before the RRT was permitted to pay any regard to his conduct in Australia, which is the issue upon which the appeal has been focussed. The second ground of appeal cannot be sustained either, having regard to the terms of s 91R(3). It was, as I have said, ultimately a matter for the appellant to satisfy the RRT about his motivation. [29] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs34" from="[2007] FMCA 1828">26. Thus, even if the Tribunal was otherwise obliged to extend an invitation to the applicant under s.425(1) (see SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 and cf SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 per Buchanan J at [32]-[33], and SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 483 at [28] - [37]), as there had been no response to the 424A letter, under s.424C(2) of the Act, the Tribunal could make a decision on the review without taking any further action to obtain the applicant's views on the information and, by virtue of s.425(2)(c) of the Act, sub-s.425(1) did not apply to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs35" from="[2007] FMCA 1659">As recorded above, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant's Christian observances in Australia were undertaken otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee. The implied disregard of this conduct by virtue of s.91R(3) , raises the question, as suggested by the Minister, that an obligation fell on the Tribunal to identify the satisfaction required by s.91R(3) as an issue arising in relation to the decision under review in respect of which the Tribunal is required by s.425 of the Act to invite the applicant to give evidence and present arguments. SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 , Buchanan J considered the question of whether the Tribunal had to put an applicant on notice that the satisfaction required by s.91R(3) was an issue in the case. His Honour held that the burden under s.91R(3) lay on the applicant to satisfy the Tribunal about his motivation before the Tribunal was permitted to pay any regard to the applicant's conduct in Australia, that conduct being the issue upon which the proceedings had been focused. His Honour further held that the Tribunal did not have a positive obligation to alert the applicant to the fact that it might conclude it should disregard his conduct in Australia. Moreover, in that case, his Honour observed that the issue which was central to the appeal before him was identified by the terms of the sub-section itself holding: The RRT was not obliged to draw it to the Appellant's attention or to warn him that it would disregard material about his conduct in Australia if he did not satisfy the RRT that the reasons for the conduct was genuine. (at [31]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs36" from="[2007] FMCA 1057">25. I am afraid I am unable to accept this submission. It is clear in my view that the constitution of the Tribunal took place pursuant to s.354 of the Act and I find the reasoning of the Full Court in SZEPZ to be fully on point, as was all but conceded by counsel for the Applicant. I do not think the decision of Buchanan J in SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942 (" SZILQ "), which I accept turned on its own facts, leads to any different conclusion. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs37" from="[2007] FMCA 1317">The Applicants as promised were invited to comment on the information and to give further information and did so. The Applicants did not request a further hearing: cf. SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 942. What the Applicants are suggesting by this ground is that s 360 somehow obliges the Tribunal to give the Applicants a further chance to comment on the material put forward to support the issue arising under review, at the point at which the Tribunal became minded to make an unfavourable decision on the material given. It is hard to see how this suggested obligation is able to be derived from any of the statutory obligations on the Tribunal in Part 5 , and, specifically, is able to be derived from s 360 especially in light of the well established authority that the Tribunal is not obliged to reveal its thought processes: Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs38" from="[2007] FMCA 1524">30. The final ground raised by the applicant was that the Tribunal had breached its statutory duty under s.425 Migration Act 1958 to give the applicant a genuine and realistic opportunity to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. The applicant strove to bring her case within the ambit of that considered by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration [2006] HCA 63 and SZILQ v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 942 arguing that nowhere did the Tribunal put to the applicant its concerns about her credibility, nor did it put to her that it did not give weight to the letter from her family.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs39" from="[2007] FCA 1224">

35 If, in the circumstances, the Tribunal was under an obligation to put the inconsistent statements to the appellant for comment, that obligation could only have arisen if, and to the extent that, s 425 of the Act so dictated in the circumstances. It prescribed the opportunity that was to be given in circumstances such as the present to an applicant at a Tribunal hearing by way of "the natural justice hearing rule" beyond what was required by s 424A: cf SZILQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 942. </sentence>
