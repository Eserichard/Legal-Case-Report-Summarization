<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 470">In the circumstances it was difficult to draw the inference that the employees agreed to the 2007 agreement because of the representations made in the documents. The appeal was dismissed. The principles discussed in Shop Distributive &amp; Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd were applied by Cowdroy J in Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union v Luxottica Retail Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 608 ; (2009) 185 IR 164. In Luxottica it was claimed by the union that the information provided to employees relating to the vote for a new industrial agreement for 2009 was misleading. His Honour held at [33]: 
[T]he court must have some evidence before it that the employees were aware that the proposed agreement was clearly more advantageous to the Award, that is, whether the employees were aware of the content of the Award.</sentence>
