<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 466">LFF is an incorporated association. Its objects include: the promotion of the conservation and better management of Australia's native forests and the stimulation and encouragement of public interest in the value and importance of protecting native forests and related environmental issues: see Lawyers for Forests Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 588 at [2] . It has determined that, in pursuit of its objects and, in what it perceives to be the public interest, that the Minister's approval of construction of the pulp mill should be challenged. It has a democratic and legal right to do so. These considerations do not, however, weigh strongly in favour of the making of the orders which it seeks.  The case advanced by LFF was arguable. It was so held by Marshall J in the course of a preliminary hearing in which security for costs was sought: see Lawyers for Forests Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 588 at [14] . It was not, however, a test case; nor did it raise novel issues. The resolution of the various issues raised by the grounds relied on by LFF turned, in the main, on the application of well established judicial review principles to the written reasons of the Minister and the documentary material considered by him when he made his decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 330">Gunns Limited ("Gunns") proposes to build and operate a pulp mill at Bell Bay in Tasmania. When the mill is operative effluent from the production process is to be discharged into Bass Strait some kilometres offshore. It is possible that such discharge may have an adverse effect on an area of Bass Strait which forms part of the Commonwealth marine environment. In order to undertake the construction of the mill it was, therefore, necessary that Gunns first obtained the approval of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts ("the Minister") under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) ("the Act"). The Minister gave his approval on 4 October 2007. The applicant ("LFF") has been found to be a person aggrieved by that decision within the meaning of s 487(3) of the Act: see Lawyers for Forests Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 588. LFF seeks judicial review of the Minister's decision on a number of grounds. The review is sought under both the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("the ADJR Act") and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). </sentence>
