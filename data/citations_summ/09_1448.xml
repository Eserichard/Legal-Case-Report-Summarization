<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 206">Neither party submitted that the judgment should not be given in US dollars. The parties' terms of trade required payments to be made in US dollars and the Award was made in US dollars. The arbitration costs order was originally expressed in Ugandan shillings but has now been converted to US dollars. In my view, the appropriate course is to give the judgment in US dollars. Although it was once considered inappropriate for an Australian court to give judgment in a foreign currency, that is no longer the law. Judgments are now routinely given in a foreign currency, if the circumstances warrant such an approach. One circumstance which is regarded as warranting such an approach is where the action in question is to enforce a foreign money obligation, as is the case here (see Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd [1976] AC 443 at 497H (per Lord Cross of Chelsea); Westpac Banking Corporation v "Stone Gemini" [1999] FCA 917 at [2] (per Tamberlin J); and BHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd (No 4) [2009] FCA 1448 ; (2009) 263 ALR 63 at [3] (p 64) (per Finkelstein J)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] VSC 65">26 The guiding principle concerning the currency in which judgment should be entered is that it should be the currency which best reflects the plaintiff's loss. [19] In the absence of the parties otherwise providing by contract, "the damage should be calculated in the currency in which the loss was felt" [20] or "which most truly expresses [the] loss". [21] This requires evidence if the matter is in dispute. Counsel for the underwriter resisted the claim for judgment in Australian currency contending that it had been open to Orica to have pleaded its entitlement to damages in Australian currency and that the underwriter would have conducted its case differently had Orica's case been one for an entitlement to judgment in Australian currency. 25 Judgment may be entered in Australian currency where that is appropriate. In Siemens Limited v Schenker International (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 2) [17] Barrett J entered judgment in Australian currency notwithstanding that the relevant transactions were largely in German currency. In that case the plaintiff was an Australian company operating in Australia. It kept its books of account in Australian currency and conducted a large part of its business in Australian currency even though it entered into some German currency transactions. [18] </sentence>
