<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 35">A convenient and (respectfully) helpful summary, which I gratefully adopt, is provided by Gordon J in Stevenson v Murdoch Community Services Inc . [79] Beginning at [99] of that judgment, her Honour said: [99] Section 659 of the WR Act is a "reverse onus" provision: see ss 664 and 809 of the WR Act. [100] As a result: where there is an allegation of termination of employment by an employer for a proscribed reason, it is sufficient for it to be presumed that the conduct was engaged in for that reason unless the employer proves to the contrary: see, by way of example, Rojas v Esselte Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1585 ; (2008) 177 IR 306 at [46] --- [51]; Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal, Clerical and Services Union [2001] FCA 349 ; (2001) 112 FCR 232 at [7] ; Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers [1999] FCA 1108 ; [1999] FCA 1108 ; (1999) 91 FCR 463 at [109] (dealing with the predecessor to s 298V of the WR Act); Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; (1999) 93 FCR 34 at 68. That presumption is rebuttable: Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; 93 FCR 34 at 68; however, notwithstanding that presumption, an applicant must prove the existence of objective facts which the applicant contends provide a basis for the respondent's contravening conduct: see Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1531 ; (1999) 140 IR 131 at [161] --- [162]. The presumption "simply ... alleviate[s] the evidentiary difficulty facing the applicant of providing proof of the intent or reason which motivated, or formed part of the motivation for, the respondent's conduct following the absence of the employee from work" (emphasis added); if an applicant proves those facts and alleges that the conduct was carried out for a prohibited reason, then the onus shifts to the respondent to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that it was not motivated by a proscribed reason: Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; [1999] FCA 899 ; 93 FCR 34 at 68. Why? Because, as Nicholson J stated, "[t]he reversal of the onus in respect of proof of the reasons for the conduct is a recognition that 'the circumstances by reason of which an employer may take action against an employee are, of necessity, peculiarly with the knowledge of the employer'"; and where the onus has shifted, an employer will usually need to adduce evidence of the real reason for the dismissal, consistent with the absence of a prohibited reason, to rebut the presumption: Rojas 177 IR 306 at [46] --- [51] and Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 ; (2006) 161 IR 9 at [29] . </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 284">In all of the cases to which I was referred which had been decided under the equivalent provisions of the IR Act and the WR Act and others which I have examined, the court proceeded on the basis that evidence of the employer's subjective reasons for taking the impugned action was relevant in deciding whether the employer had taken the action because of the existence of one or more of the circumstances in which such action was impermissible. See, for example, Bowling v General Motors Holden Pty Ltd (1975) 8 ALR 197 at 205-6 (s 5); Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; (1999) 93 FCR 34 at 69, 83-5 (ss 298K-298L); Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union v Ansett Australia Ltd [2000] FCA 441 ; (2000) 175 ALR 173 at 187-192 (ss 298K-298L); Elliott v Kodak Australasia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 807 ; (2001) 108 IR 23 at 30-1(ss 298K-298L); Finance Sector Union of Australia v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2002] FCA 631 ; [2002] FCA 631 ; (2002) 120 FCR 107 at 143-4 (ss 298K-298L); The United Firefighters Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board (2003) 123 IR 86 at 113-5 (ss 298K-298L); Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 ; (2006) 161 IR 9 ( "Seymour" ) at 13-14 (ss 792-793); Dowling v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 339 ; (2009) 182 IR 28 at [40] (ss 792-793). It is to be noted that the approach remained the same after the criminal offences were replaced by a civil penalty regime. Counsel for Mr Barclay did not cite any authority which supported the contrary proposition which they urged on the court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 853">The onus essentially falls upon the employer (see Jessup C, "The Onus of Proof in Proceedings under Part XA of the Workplace Relations Act" 1996 (2002) 15 Australian Journal of Labour Law 198 and Latham I, "Enforcement of the Workplace Relations Act : The Use of Civil Penalties" (2004) 10(5) Employment Law Bulletin ). Normally sworn evidence denying any such reason would be necessary. In most cases an explanation of the real reason for dismissal, consistent with temporary absence not being a reason would, in a practical sense, be necessary (see General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd v Bowling (1976) 12 ALR 605 at 612 per Gibbs J and Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 at [29] per Buchanan J in relation to a similar statutory presumption in s.809 of the Act). While in his response the second respondent denied that there was a termination of Mr Torpia's employment because of any absence from work, no evidence in this respect has been filed, notwithstanding that the hearing was adjourned on two occasions and Mr Zarfati was given further opportunities to file affidavit evidence. I am not satisfied that the letter of dismissal dated 23 May 2008 constitutes proof by the employer that the termination by Empire Printing was for a reason or reasons that did not include a proscribed reason under s.659 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 339">In Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 ; (2006) 161 IR 9 at [29] Buchanan J observed that in order to succeed the respondent will usually have to provide "an explanation of the real reason for dismissal [of the applicant] consistent with the absence of [a prohibited reason] as a reason". It is necessary therefore to consider the reasons advanced by Fairfax for terminating the applicant's employment. As is apparent from the terms of the termination letter, the reasons advanced by Fairfax for the termination are as follows: The applicant failed to properly discharge his duties; The applicant breached his employment contract; The applicant acted in a manner that did or was likely to bring Fairfax into serious disrepute; and The applicant breached Fairfax's Code of Conduct. 
Given that Mr Stokes made the decision to terminate the applicant's employment, it is necessary to examine the explanation proffered by Mr Stokes as to why the applicant's employment was terminated. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 220">At para 31(ii) it is submitted that, "An explicit denial from the relevant decision-makers that a prohibited reason formed part of their decision-making will not generally discharge the onus of showing the conduct was not for a prohibited reason". Reliance is placed upon the decision of Buchanan J in Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 at [128] - [129] and to that of Merkel J in Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union v Ansett Australia Ltd [2000] FCA 441 ; (2000) 175 ALR 173 at [76] . However neither citation supports the proposition. Both references contain observations concerning the evidence of particular witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 21">In Mr Crow's written submissions he identifies the conduct of the respondent that constituted the breach as: a dismissal or threatened dismissal of Ms Adams for a prohibited reason in contravention of s.792(1)(a) of the WR Act; an injury or threatened injury to Ms Adams in her employment for a prohibited reason, in contravention of s.792(1)(b) of the WR Act; an alteration or threatened alteration to the position of Ms Adams as an employee to her prejudice for a prohibited reason, in contravention of s.792(1)(c) of the WR Act; and a refusal or threatened refusal to employ Ms Adams as an employee for a particular reason, in contravention of s.792(1)(d) of the WR Act. 
Section 809 of the WR Act presumes that the respondents had that reason and places the onus on the respondents to displace the presumption: Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 ; (2006) 161 IR 9. It is submitted that the respondents made no attempt to displace the presumption required by s.809. The affidavits of the second respondent (paragraph 39) and the third respondent (paragraph 19) clearly state that they ceased to employ Ms Adams because she failed to sign and return the second AWA. I am satisfied that the evidence reviewed above positively establishes the prohibited action of the respondents. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 1490">The applicant referred to Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 where at [126] Buchanan J described the respondents' task, in the light of s.809, is to displace the legislative presumption that it has acted for a reason which contravenes the s.793 of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1585">60 The respondent has not provided an "an explanation of the real reason for dismissal [of the applicant] consistent with the absence of delegateship or membership as a reason": Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 at [29] per Buchanan J. The respondent has not displaced the presumption created by s 809 of the WR Act. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the respondent dismissed the applicant at least for a reason that included a prohibited reason (if not solely for that reason), namely that he was a delegate of the NUW. However I should indicate, in addition, that the evidence establishes (apart from the presumption) that a reason why the respondent dismissed the applicant was that he was a delegate. In my opinion, an inference can readily be drawn that part of the reason the respondent dismissed the applicant was that he was the NUW delegate at the Minto site.  48 The reasoning behind the reversal of the onus of proof in (what is now) s 809 was explained by Nicholson J in Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; (1999) 93 FCR 34 at 68, where his Honour said:
 
 If the applicant proves the conduct and alleges that the conduct was carried out for a prohibited reason, it is for the respondent to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that it was not motivated by an impermissible reason ... The reversal of the onus in respect of proof of the reasons for the conduct is a recognition that "the circumstances by reason of which an employer may take action against an employee are, of necessity, peculiarly with the knowledge of the employer". (References omitted) 

Moreover, the effect of s 809 is that in most cases an explanation for the real reason for the dismissal, consistent with the absence of a prohibited reason, is, in a practical sense, also necessary to rebut the presumption. As Buchanan J said in Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 at [29]: 
 
 Because the respondent must exclude delegateship and membership as a reason for termination, normally sworn evidence denying any such reason is necessary and, in most cases, an explanation of the real reason for dismissal consistent with the absence of delegateship or membership as a reason is, in a practical sense, also necessary. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 615">Concerning procedure he submitted that the authorities are now well settled, the onus is upon the Applicant to establish the factual elements of her case: NVA v CSL [2002] FCA 513 ; CFMEU v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1531 ; (1999) 140 IR 131 ; Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 ; (2006) 161 IR 9. Those matters being: conduct; the respondent carrying out conduct for a reason would constitute a contravention of Part XIV of the Act; and if the relevant conduct is established then the Respondent bears an onus to establish whether or not the reason was a sole or dominant reason for the purposes of section 809. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FMCA 1883">It is alleged by the applicant that the respondent bears the onus, on the balance of probabilities, of excluding a conclusion that the applicant was dismissed for a prohibited reason. The applicant refers to the decision of Justice Buchanan in Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd (2006) 161 IR 9 ; [2006] FCA 1452 and the passage in the headnote which summaries the decision accurately as follows: Because the respondent must exclude the prohibited reasons as a reason for termination normally sworn evidence denying any such reason is necessary and, in most cases, an explanation of the reason for dismissal consistent with the absence of the prohibited reason is, in a practical sense, also necessary. 
Those conclusions are found in paragraphs 27---31 of the decision (pp.13-14). At pp.13-14, his Honour summarises the effect of s.809, namely, that the respondent bears an onus to exclude the conclusion that the applicant's were dismissed in contravention of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCA 169">
 

36 I note that both Nicholson J in Maritime Union of Australia [1999] FCA 899 ; 93 FCR 34 and Buchanan J in Seymour [2006] FCA 1452 recognised that it is for the respondent to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the termination was not motivated by an impermissible reason. Mr Hinson SC on behalf of the applicant submitted that the standard of proof in this case was the civil standard of the balance of probabilities. 33 Accordingly, in most cases an explanation of the real reason for dismissal consistent with the absence of a prohibited reason is, in a practical sense, also necessary to rebut the presumption (cf Buchanan J in Seymour [2006] FCA 1452 at [29]). This explanation must appear in the evidence of the person or persons who made the decision to terminate the employment of the relevant employees.
  32 The reasoning behind the reversal of the onus of proof was explained in the context of earlier equivalent sections of the Act by Nicholson J in Maritime Union of Australia 93 FCR at 68, citing Heidt v Chrysler Australia Ltd (1976) 26 FLR 257 at 266-271 per Northrop J, where his Honour said:
 
 If the applicant proves the conduct and alleges that the conduct was carried out for a prohibited reason, it is for the respondent to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that it was not motivated by an impermissible reason....... The reversal of the onus in respect of proof of the reasons for the conduct is a recognition that "the circumstances by reason of which an employer may take action against an employee are, of necessity, peculiarly with the knowledge of the employer": Heidt v Chrysler Australia Ltd at 267. (cf recent comments of Buchanan J in Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 at [28] ). </sentence>
