<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 523">It has been consistently held in this Court that there is no appeal from an order of a judge granting or refusing leave to appeal against an interlocutory judgment (see Reid v Nairn (1985) 60 ALR 419 ; Thomas Borthwick &amp; Sons (Pacific Holdings) Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1988) 18 FCR 424 ; Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 ; Kristoffersen v Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business [2002] FCAFC 269 ; Hamod v New South Wales (2002) 188 ALR 659 (at [14]---[15]); Dart v Norwich Union Life Australia Limited [2005] FCA 327 (at [32]---[34]); Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1717 (at [54]---[55])). An application for leave to appeal, therefore, must be assessed, in part, having regard to the potential consequences for an unsuccessful applicant for such leave. Tests have been developed to accommodate that issue and I shall refer to them shortly. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCAfam 389">At [41] the Full Court continued - quoting Lander J in Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1717: "A direction under O 46, r 7A is made by a Judge to assist the Registrar in the administration of the registry and "is not a determination of right made by a Judge after hearing or considering arguments or submissions upon an application to the Court seeking the exercise of judicial power"; Bizuneh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 42 ; Thus, it is not a judgment which is subject to appeal by a person whose document has been rejected by the Registrar in accordance with a direction by a Judge. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 47"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCAFC 172">21 It is a well-established principle that a judge is entitled to immunity in respect of any act done by him in the exercise of his jurisdiction: see Fingleton v The Queen [2005] HCA 34 ; (2005) 227 CLR 166 per Gleeson CJ at [36] in which his Honour quoted the observations of Lord Denning in Sirros v Moore [1975] QB 118 at 132; see also Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1717 per Lander J at [63]-[67]. At [64] his Honour Lander J quoted the observations of Lord Denning in Sirros :
 Ever since the year 1613, if not before, it has been accepted in our law that no action is maintainable against a judge for anything said or done by him in the exercise of a jurisdiction which belongs to him. The words which he speaks are protected by an absolute privilege. The orders which he gives, and the sentences which he imposes, cannot be made the subject of civil proceedings against him. No matter that the judge was under some gross error of ignorance, or was actuated by envy, hatred and malice, and all uncharitableness, he is not liable to an action. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1171">There is authority in this Court to the effect that a mere direction by a Judge of this Court to a Registrar of this Court pursuant to O 46 r 7A(2) (and its predecessor rule) is not a judgment of this Court able to be subjected to appeal by a person whose document has been rejected by a Registrar pursuant to the direction given by the Judge (see Bizuneh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 42 ; (2003) 128 FCR 353 at [11] ---[19] (pp 356---357) (per Lee, Whitlam and Jacobson JJ); Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1556 at [16] (per Gordon J); and Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1717 at [58] (per Lander J). See also Legal Aid Commission (WA) v Edwards (No 2) [1982] FCA 103 ; (1982) 61 FLR 419 ; 42 ALR 154 which is not directly in point but which contains reasoning to the same effect). In Bizuneh [2003] FCAFC 42 ; 128 FCR 353 , the Full Court said (at [15]) (p 357), that a rule substantially in the same form as the current rule " removed a clog on the Registrar's discretion ". The Full Court said that the Registrar can now act to refuse to accept or issue a document without first obtaining the authority from a Judge so to act. This power is intended to enable the Registrar to maintain the efficient operation of the Registry and thus, of the Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCAFC 162">18 In Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1556 at [16] Gordon J relied on Bizuneh to conclude that a direction under O 46 r 7A is not a judgment from which an appeal may be brought. Lander J took the same view when dismissing an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of Gordon J ( Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1717 at [58] ). See also Bienstein v Family Court of Australia [2008] FCA 1138 per Gray J at [72]-[74].
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 47">10 Kristoffersen and many other cases accepted the premise that there was no appeal from the exercise of a discretion by a single judge refusing leave to appeal. This premise may be distilled, in particular, from the judgment in Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Pacific Holdings) Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1988) 18 FCR 424 ( 'Thomas Borthwick' ). The conclusion in Thomas Borthwick was that the exercise by a single judge of a discretion with respect to the grant or refusal of leave to appeal was part of the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of the Court and, where leave was refused, exhausted that jurisdiction. The principles in Thomas Borthwick have been regularly applied in this Court (see, for example, Wati , Hamod v New South Wales (2002) 188 ALR 659 at 663 [14] --- [15], Dart v Norwich Union Life Australia Ltd [2005] FCA 327 at [32] --- [34], Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1717 at [54] --- [55]).</sentence>
