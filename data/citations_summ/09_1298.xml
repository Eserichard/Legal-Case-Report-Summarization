 374 The applicants contend that the claims they have against Devere and Packham to account are in addition to, not in substitution of the applicants' right to a one-third interest in the Dongara Land. I accept these claims are additional or separate subject only to the proviso that the applicants should not be permitted to be compensated more than once in the sense of 'double dipping': Deckers Outdoor Corporation Inc v Farley (No 5) [2009] FCA 1298 ; (2009) 262 ALR 53 (at [76]) per Tracey J. 
 

 
 
 375 As will be evident from the analysis of the evidence, the Dongara Land has now been encumbered by Castleworld with a mortgage in favour of Investec from which the monies received by Devere and Packham were procured. The accounting of those monies to the applicants will permit the applicants to eliminate or reduce the liability under the mortgage.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 657">Charge 18 --- Between December 2005 and (at least) November 2007 Mr Vaysman caused and encouraged the use of a factory in Roper Street Moorabbin for manufacturing and selling counterfeit footwear. He did so contrary to consent orders to which he was a party which were made by the Court on 12 March 2004. During this period, as I found in Deckers Outdoor Corporation Inc. v Farley (No 5) [2009] FCA 1298 (" Deckers (No 5) ") at [84]-[92], over 30,000 pairs of counterfeit boots were sold with the profit on those sales amounting to over $3 million. Charge 19 --- Between December 2005 and November 2007 Mr Vaysman procured the services of five persons to act as his agents in offering for sale and selling counterfeit footwear. He then assisted them in carrying out their marketing and selling activities.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 560">This contempt proceeding, like that dealt with in Deckers Outdoor Corporation Inc. v Farley (No 6) [2010] FCA 391 , arises out of proceedings for alleged trade mark infringement, copyright infringement, passing-off and breaches of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act") which date back to 2003: see Deckers Outdoor Corporation Inc. v Farley (No 5) [2009] FCA 1298 ; (2009) 262 ALR 53. Over this period the Court made a series of orders which restrained various respondents from engaging in the manufacture, distribution and sale of counterfeit footwear which bore the "Ugg" logo. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 391">The Applicant designs and manufactures popular sheepskin footwear identifiable by the name "Ugg" and an "UGG" logo and fiercely guards its intellectual property. These contempt proceedings arise out of proceedings brought by the Applicant's predecessor in 2003 and a further proceeding against twenty-two respondents for alleged trade mark infringement, copyright infringement, passing off and breaches of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Trade Practices Act " ) which was commenced by the Applicant in 2007: see Deckers Outdoor Corporation Inc v Farley &amp; Ors (No 5) [2009] FCA 1298 ; (2009) 262 ALR 53. </sentence>
