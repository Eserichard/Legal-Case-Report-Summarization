<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 15">In Wilhelm v McKay [2007] FCA 367 , Greenwood J refused an application to join a party to an application for an order to review certain decisions relating to the application for a search warrant under the Crimes Act . The party sought to be joined was the person who decided to apply for the search warrant. The circumstances, at least at that level of generality, appear to be the same as those applicable to the decision of the fifth "respondent" (and of the AFP and the DCT, as alleged in paras 9.8 and 9.9 of the amended application). His Honour decided that the decision to swear the affidavit in support of the application for the search warrant and to apply for it were not decisions of an administrative character made under an enactment: see s 3(1) of the ADJR Act. Counsel for Mr Nicholls did contend that the decision was plainly wrong and should not be followed: see eg Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 55 FCR 233 at 255. I respectively adopt his Honour's reasons at [60] to [70]. I shall not repeat them.  As is apparent, I have assumed that a decision to provide to the Magistrate in support of the application for the search warrant information which could not lawfully be presented to him (or, somewhat more obliquely, a decision not to inform the Magistrate that information provided to him could not be relied upon by him) is a decision to which the ADJR Act may apply. That is not obviously so, for the reasons discussed in [37] above. In addition, the operative decision directly affecting the rights of Mr Nicholls is that to issue the search warrant. If that decision is not set aside, the operative decision will not have been impaired by the decision complained of itself being attacked. It is probable, in my view, that the cases discussed by Greenwood J in Wilhelm v McKay [2007] FCA 367 at [78] to [80] point to circumstances which would enliven s 5(1)(g) of the ADJR Act in relation to the decision to issue the warrant, namely that the decision to issue the warrant was induced or affected by fraud. For reasons which appear below, it is not necessary finally to decide whether that is the correct analysis of the decisions referred to. However, in considering whether to permit the amended application to be amended or read in the way which Mr Nicholls now contends, I encompass within that consideration the possibility that ground 9.4 of the amended application might be preserved so as to entertain an attack upon the validity of the decision to issue the search warrant if it were induced or affected by fraud.  The relevant question is whether, upon the proper construction of s 65 of the TAA and ss 263 and 264 of the ITAA, those provisions in their context permit or prohibit the use of information acquired under them for the purpose of applying for a search warrant under s 3E of the Crimes Act , and so for the purpose of exercising the power under s 3E. See the discussion in Wilhelm v McKay [2007] FCA 367 per Greenwood J at [78].  Is there any point of distinction? In Wilhelm v McKay [2007] FCA 367 , one contention was that the applicant for the search warrant did not disclose certain information to the Magistrate. In that case, the non-disclosure was of information which the applicant claimed should have been disclosed. At [78] to [80], Greenwood J reviewed certain authorities touching upon the validity of search warrants procured through fraud or the absence of good faith: see eg Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2001) 111 FCR 175 at 225 [238] ; Lego Australia Pty Ltd v Paraggio [1994] FCA 1286 ; (1994) 52 FCR 542. He accepted at [80] that "the fundament of the duty is a duty to act in good faith and avoid making half-truths giving rise to a misrepresentation". His Honour's focus then was upon whether the applicants in that case had demonstrated an arguable case that in swearing the affidavit in support of the application for, and in applying for, the search warrant the person seeking the search warrant had misrepresented material facts going to the exercise of the power by the Magistrate to issue the warrant. </sentence>
