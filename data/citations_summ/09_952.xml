<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] RRTA 616">In making this finding, the Tribunal has also taken into consideration the oral submission made by the applicant's adviser at the Tribunal hearing in relation to the judgment in SZLWA v MIAC [2009] FCA 952. In SZLWA , the issue as to whether the applicant was entitled to make an independent application was not challenged and was not considered by the Court. It is noted that the applicant in SZLWA made her own application for a visa before 1 July 2009. At the hearing, the solicitor said that she understood that her adviser had considered the relevance of the judgment in SZLWA v MIAC [2009] FCA 952 (29 August 2009) to the applicant's case. She requested that additional time be given for a submission on this issue to be lodged with the Tribunal. The applicant was granted time to lodge any further submission. The applicant's adviser advised the Tribunal by fax that she did not intend to lodge further submissions. </sentence>
