<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 493">Lanepoint was subject to a presumption of insolvency when receivers were appointed to it pursuant to a floating charge: s 459C(2)(c) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act"). Australian Securities and Investment Commission ("ASIC") has applied to wind up Lanepoint on the basis of this presumption. This discharges ASIC's obligation to demonstrate a prima facie case that Lanepoint is insolvent and therefore meets the condition for the grant of leave under s 459P(3) of the Act: ASIC v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (No 3 ) [2006] FCA 1710 at [53] and ASIC v Eastlands Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1702 at [64] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 257">Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd ("Lanepoint") is a direct subsidiary of Bowesco Pty Ltd ("Bowesco") and both are related or associated companies within the wider Westpoint Group of companies. Bowesco became subject to a presumption of insolvency when receivers were appointed to it pursuant to floating charges. ASIC has applied to wind up Bowesco on the basis of this presumption: ASIC v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1710 at [53] and ASIC v Eastland Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1702 at [64] . The jurisdiction of this Court to wind up companies is conferred by the Corporations Act s 459A and s 459B. ASIC has standing to make the applications under the Act s 459P and s 464.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1541">47 In the event that I appointed a liquidator, it was submitted by the creditors that the liquidator be appointed as receiver of certain trust assets. In the appropriate case this could be ordered --- see ASIC v Eastlands Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1702. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] NSWSC 214">8 I regard these second, third and fourth matters as defects or irregularities in connection with the application of the type referred to in s.467A. It was suggested by White J in Australian Beverage Distributors Pty Ltd v Evans &amp; Tate Premium Wines Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 560 ; (2006) 230 ALR 184 at [59] that use of "merely" in s.467A indicates that the section is concerned with breaches of the rules "not at the higher end on the scale of seriousness". The alternative construction (which seems to me preferable) is that "merely", in the phrase "merely because of", does not refer to the seriousness of the breach but is just part of the modern drafter's equivalent of "by reason only that". On that basis, substantial injustice is the only issue raised by s.467A: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Eastlands Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1702. At all events, it is clear in the case before me that the three matters of timing non-compliance are by no means at the higher end of any scale of seriousness that may be relevant. Section 467A precludes dismissal of the plaintiff's winding up because of those defects, unless the court is satisfied that substantial injustice has been caused by the defects or any of them. </sentence>
