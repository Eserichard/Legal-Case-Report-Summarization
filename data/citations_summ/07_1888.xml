<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 421">Further, Mr Roe has no personal right to be a member of the persons comprising the applicant. There is no provision in the Native Title Act which provides that an applicant must be comprised of representatives of each of the subgroups within the native title claim group. See Coyne v State of Western Australia [2009] FCA 533 at [24] , Butterworth on behalf of the Wiri Core Country Claim v Queensland [2010] FCA 325 at [31] and Que Noy v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 1888 at [23] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 743">The Commonwealth has pointed out that there will be cases in which it is important not only that persons are individually authorised as part of the applicant, but also that the particular group of persons is collectively authorised to act on behalf of the claim group. There may be sectional interests within the claim group whose interests are balanced by the particular combination of authorised persons. It is clear that such circumstances may arise. That is why s 66B empowers the claim group in its terms and in the circumstances it specifies. Que Noy v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 1888 provides an example of a claim group doing so. It would not be consistent with the clear objectives of the NT Act, on the other hand, to impose the s 66B procedure on the claim group where there were no such considerations. One might ask rhetorically why a native title claim group should have removed from it the capacity to make decisions for itself about whether, in particular circumstances, such as the death of an authorised person, it wishes to enliven s 66B or whether it is content to allow the remaining authorised applicants to continue to act in accordance with their authorisation? </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 56">12 The decision of the Kamu to authorise the applicants to make the applications in these matters was a decision made unanimously at a meeting that was held at the Mirrambeena Resort in Darwin on 9 February 2007 ('the Kamu meeting'). The correlating decisions of the other peoples within the broader native title claim group were made separately at subsequent meetings some months later, but there is no dispute about those parts of the decision making process. On the traditional decision making process of the broader native title claim group: see the trial judge's reasons at [2007] FCA 1888 at [38] . These appeals essentially revolve around the Kamu meeting and, specifically, whether the critical decision made at the Kamu meeting was made in accordance with the traditional laws and customs of the Kamu.
  15 The learned trial judge conducted a thorough review of the relevant evidence at [27]-[31] of his decision in the Douglas North claim: [2007] FCA 1888 , as follows (excluding the irrelevant parts):
 
 
 [27] ... the evidence said to support that that decision had been made was said to come from the affidavit of Ms Mearns. That affidavit outlined the details of a meeting of the Kamu people on 9 February 2007. The meeting did not extend to all members of the native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1889">1 In this matter, as in the matter of Que Noy v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 1888 (the Douglas North claim), there is a motion under s 66B of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act) by certain members of the native title claim group to replace Marjorie Foster (Ms Foster), one of the persons comprising the current "applicant" with her daughter, Margaret Foster and with Arthur Que Noy. 5 An anthropologist, Mr Kim Barber, gave evidence about meetings of the Ngangiwumeri people on 25 June 2007 and of the Malak Malak people on 25 June 2007. His record of those meetings is in much the same terms as that used for the meetings of the Wagiman people and the Warai people recorded in the reasons in Que Noy [2007] FCA 1888. The members of the Malak Malak people who attended the meeting on 25 June 2007 were: John Sullivan, Eddie Andrews, Albert Myoung, Rita Purak, Helen Korda, Francis Miljat, Kitty Waliwararra, Biddy Lindsay, Edwin Purral and Amos Shileds. Those people were described by Mr Barber as 'the majority of the upper generation of Malak Malak persons. '</sentence>
