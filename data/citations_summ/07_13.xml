<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 696">19 I mention these matters concerning the effects of termination of the deed as a precursor to a consideration of the decision of French J in Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 13 ; (2007) 156 FCR 501. His Honour there held that the inquisitorial processes of Part 5.9 were not available in relation to a company that was not and had never been subject to any form of external administration or other process contemplated by Chapter 5. ASIC had granted an authority to Highstoke (a company) causing it to come within paragraph (e) of the s 9 definition of "eligible applicant" in relation Hayes Knight, its predecessor as trustee for debenture holders of Performance Finance. Highstoke, on behalf of the Performance Finance debenture holders, had commenced proceedings against Hayes Knight alleging misfeasance as trustee. Upon application made to the Federal Court, it obtained the issue of an examination summons in respect of one O'Brien, a director of Hayes Knight, with a view to investigating Hayes Knight's professional indemnity insurance. French J ordered that the examination summons be discharged and that the authority granted by ASIC to Highstoke be quashed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] QCA 131">[14] Reference was also made to discussions of the nature of judicial power in Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd and Another [15] and Re Sons of Gwalia Ltd; Ex Parte Love, [16] cases involving the issue of summonses for examinations under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1211">The applicant relied upon the decisions of Wickramasinghe v The Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 1558 , SZJBA v The Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 ; (2007) 98 ALD 270 and Minister for Immigration v Le [2007] FCA 1318; (2007) 164 FCR 151; (2007) 242 ALR 455 ; (2007) 97 ALD 112 . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] WASC 75">22 The operation of s 596B is not confined to liquidators. Nevertheless, the power to issue examination summonses is not at large; the provisions are only applicable to companies in some form of external administration and cannot be used in relation to solvent companies: Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 13 ; (2007) 156 FCR 501 [87], [89] (French J).
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 59">The private examination of persons pursuant to Div 2 of Pt 3 of the ASIC Act in aid of an investigation by ASIC pursuant to Div 1 of Pt 3 has a different history, role and purpose from examinations pursuant to Div 1 of Pt 5.9 of the Corporations Act . The latter are a long standing feature of insolvency administration, the history, nature and purpose of which have been analysed in many cases --- most recently by Lander J in Evans v Wainter Pty Limited [2005] FCAFC 114 ; (2005) 145 FCR 176 and French J in Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 13 and need not be repeated.  It is also submitted that the common law right to maintain silence will be encroached upon. It is not clear to me that the so called common law right to silence is a right or interest in the sense outlined in Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; 170 CLR 596 . The only authority that was cited to support that proposition, apart from the reference in the passage from the reasons of Dawson J in Johns v Australian Securities Commission 178 CLR at 437, was that of Branson J in Re Cortaus Ltd (in liq); Sheahan v Joye (No 2) (1996) 20 ACSR 576 at 578. That was an examination of the balance of convenience on an application for a contested adjournment and did not involve the present issue. There is merit in the submission by counsel for ASIC that it is hardly correct to say that an officer of a company that is in external administration has any right to silence concerning the affairs of the company. On the contrary, the officer is bound by statute, when called upon, to provide information. That has been the case for a very long time ( Rees v Kratzmann [1965] HCA 49 ; 114 CLR 63 ; Evans v Wainter 145 FCR per Lander J at [44]---[82]; per French J in Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 13 at [46] ---[78]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 36">5 On 16 January 2006 I delivered judgment discharging the examination summons and quashing the decision made by ASIC on 3 August 2005. ASIC and Highstoke were directed to pay the costs of the judicial review proceedings. Costs were reserved until today on the application to discharge the summons. The parties were given an opportunity to make submissions as to the costs in the Examination Proceedings --- Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 13. </sentence>
