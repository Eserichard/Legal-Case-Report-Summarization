(1) As a general rule the starting point is that all issues of fact and law should be determined at the one time. (2) A party seeking the determination of separate questions must satisfy the Court that it is "just and convenient" for the order to be made.

 TAVITIAN v COMMISSIONER OF HIGHWAYS &amp; ANOR 
 [2010] SASC 206 
 
 
 
 Land and Valuation Division: Civil 
 
 KOURAKIS J: The plaintiff in these proceedings, Mr Tavitian, challenges the validity of a recommendation made by the defendant, the Commissioner of Highways (the Commissioner), that the Governor proclaim a portion of Sturt Highway which runs along one of the boundaries of land owned by Mr Tavitian in the hundred of Nuriootpa (the Nuriootpa land). The Nuriootpa land runs along the eastern verge of the Sturt Highway between Gawler and Nuriootpa. Since that pronouncement, courts have repeatedly emphasised the statutory nature of the power.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] WASC 137">4 In AWB Ltd v Cole (No 2) [2006] FCA 913 ; 233 ALR 453 Young J reviewed the authorities concerning O 29 r 2(a) of the Federal Court Rules which provides that the court may make orders for the decision of any question separately from any other question, whether before, at, or after any other trial. In City of Swan v Lehman Brothers Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 784 ; (2009) 73 ACSR 86 , Rares J at [27] in turn summarised the principles extracted from the relevant authorities by Young J as follows:
 
 (1) As a general rule the starting point is that all issues of fact and law should be determined at the one time. (2) A party seeking the determination of separate questions must satisfy the court that it is 'just and convenient' for the order to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] VSC 59">This is so because the grant of a declaration is not the exercise of jurisdiction which is "truly equitable, it is merely statutory. If this be so, unclean hands is no defence to any merely statutory remedy". [47] 
71 In AWB Ltd v Cole and Anor (No 2), [48] Young J expressed the position in the following terms: 
 
 
 It is a common misconception that a declaration is an equitable remedy. It is not; it is a statutory remedy that is conferred in terms emphasising that its grant or refusal is within the discretion of the court: see Tito v Waddell (No 2) [1977] Ch 106 at 259; 3 All ER 129 at 256; 2 WLR 496 at 636; Mayfair trading C Pty Ltd v Dreyer [1958] HCA 55 ; [1958] 101 CLR 428 at 454; [1958] HCA 55 ; [1959] ALR 104 at 117 per Dixon CJ; and RP Meagher, J Heydon and M Leeming, Equity: Doctrines and Remedies , 4 th ed, Butterworths, 2002, at [19-159 
 While the refusal of declaratory relief on discretionary grounds will always be heavily dependent on the facts of the particular case, the discretion must be exercised within a framework of relevant legal principle. The cases afford guidance as to the way in which the discretion is to be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 784">In AWB Limited v Cole [No 2] [2006] FCA 913 ; (2006) 233 ALR 453 at 460-463 [26] - [40] , Young J reviewed the authorities from which (without reciting the authorities to which his Honour referred) I have taken the following principles: 
 (1) As a general rule the starting point is that all issues of fact and law should be determined at the one time. (2) A party seeking the determination of separate questions must satisfy the Court that it is "just and convenient" for the order to be made.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] VSC 398">No order under r 47.04 for the trial of a preliminary question has been made. [6] The authorities indicate that extreme caution should be exercised before any question is isolated for preliminary determination, a fortiori where the question is one of fact or mixed fact and law. [7] As will become apparent, I consider that the present question is one of mixed fact and law. To the extent that the question involves issues of fact, it may in any event be inappropriate for a judge to decide those issues, because the proceeding remains fixed for trial by jury. [8] On the other hand, some or all of the factual issues involved may not be able to be referred to a jury, because s 134AB(23) of the Act provides that a jury must not be informed that any injury in respect of which the proceeding has been brought has been deemed, found or required to be found, to be a serious injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] FCA 1234">AWB's second further amended application also sought declarations relating to the construction and validity of the Amending Act. In addition, AWB sought a declaration that the exercise of powers by the Commissioner under s 6AA(2) of the RCA, while these proceedings are pending before this Court, would constitute a contempt of Court, and injunctions restraining the Commissioner from making a decision under s 6AA(2) of the RCA. No live issues arise concerning these claims for relief: see AWB Ltd v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 2) [2006] FCA 913.
