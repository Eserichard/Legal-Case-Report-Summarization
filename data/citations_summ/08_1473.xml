<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 11">Mr Yao submitted that the Senior Member erred by selectively quoting from Re Williams and Australian Electoral Commission [1995] AATA 160 ; (1995) 38 ALD 366 (" Williams ") . He also argued that the AAT erred because it refused to follow a judgment of this Court to which he and the Secretary drew the Senior Member's attention. That was Croker v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 3) [2008] FCA 1473. He complained, too, that the Senior Member made his decision without evidence, specifically, that he had no evidence that the applicant had been paid during the eight-week preclusion period and that there no longer exists any mechanism by which the eight-week period payments can be recovered from him. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1587">1 By notice of motion filed on 10 October 2008 the applicant seeks leave to appeal against a judgment of this Court of 25 September 2008 ( Croker v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 3) [2008] FCA 1473). The trial judge dismissed the applicant's appeal pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT) dated 21 July 2008. The applicant also seeks an order dispensing with Order 52 r 10(2A)(b) of the Federal Court Rules . Order 52 r 10(2A)(b) requires a notice of motion seeking leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of the Court to be filed within seven days after the date on which the judgment was pronounced. Under Order 52 r 10(2A)(b) the applicant's notice of motion for leave should have been filed by 2 October 2008. Nevertheless the Court has power to extend the time for filing as the qualification to Order 52 r 10(2A) discloses (by the qualifying words "...or within such further time as the Court or a Judge may allow"). </sentence>
