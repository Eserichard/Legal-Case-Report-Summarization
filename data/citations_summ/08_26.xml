<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 437">Both the applicant and the respondent are content to have the present application dealt with as an application for extension of time within which to lodge an application for leave to appeal. The normal period for applying for leave to appeal in a case such as the present is seven days under O 52 r 10(2A)(b). However, the court has power to allow further time for the filing of such an application. The way in which that power should be exercised was the subject of the following observation by Lindgren J in Sharman License Holdings Limited v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 , at para 20: 
 
 In order for the court to allow further time for the filing and serving of an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment the following conditions must be satisfied: 
 
 There must be a satisfactory explanation for the delay beyond the seven-day time limit fixed by O 52 r 10(2)(b) (see for example, Deighton v Telstra Corporation Ltd (unreported, Full Court, 17 October 1997)); The application for leave to appeal must have such prospects of success as not to render the extending of time an exercise in futility. Since the test for the granting of leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment is that the decision must be attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by an appellate court, and that substantial injustice would result if leave were to be refused, supposing the decision to have been wrong ( D&eacute;cor Corporation P/L v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 398-400), in principle the question on an application for an extension of time is whether this test has sufficient prospect of being satisfied to warrant granting the extension. In practice, the debate and treatment of the arguable error question on an application for an extension of time, will be no different from what the debate and treatment of it would be on the application for leave to appeal itself. Since an applicant for an extension of time within which to appeal as of right must show "special reasons", (O 51 r 15(2)), nothing less should be required of an applicant for an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal (Deighton v Telstra Corporation Ltd, above). 
His Honour's articulation of the test to be applied when an application for an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal is made has been applied on a number of occasions by the court: see Duus v Dalvella Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 26 [9]; Carnemolla v eBay International AG [2008] FCA 1346 at para [4] ; SZMTC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 162 at para [6] ; Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Australian Building and Construction Commissioner [2010] FCA 349 [8]; and by the Full Court in Luck v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2009] FCAFC 54 [73]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 187">
 
1 I have before me an application for an order that the costs, the subject of order (2) of the orders made today in Duus v Dalvella Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 26 , be the subject of a further order pursuant to order 62 rule 3(3) that the party having the benefit of the costs order, the first and second applicants, be entitled to deliver a bill of costs and recover those costs prior to the determination of the proceedings.</sentence>
