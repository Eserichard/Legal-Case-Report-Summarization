<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 10">The relevant statutory framework of the GST Act is outlined by Dowsett J at [44] to [51] above. A number of principles are worth restating. It is convenient to state them in substantially the same way as they are stated in the GST Act. You are entitled to input tax credit for any "creditable acquisition" you make: s 11-20 of the GST Act; Pursuant to 11-5 of the GST Act, a "creditable acquisition" is made if: 
2.1 you acquire anything solely or partly for a creditable purpose ; and
 
2.2 the supply of the thing to you is a taxable supply; and
 
2.3 you provide, or are liable to provide, consideration for the supply; and
 
2.4 you are registered, or required to be registered;
 A thing is acquired for a "creditable purpose" to the extent that it is acquired in "carrying on" your enterprise: s 11-15(1) of the GST Act; Conversely, a thing is not acquired for a creditable purpose to the extent that the acquisition is of a private or domestic nature: s 11-15(2)(b) of the GST Act. ; In determining whether the partnership was "carrying on" an enterprise at the relevant time, intention or purpose of the acquisition is relevant but not determinative: see [69] to [71] of Dowsett J's reason for decision and Commissioner of Taxation v Swansea Services Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 402 ; (2009) 72 ATR 120 at [73] to [75]. "Carrying on" an enterprise is defined in the GST Act as including "doing anything in the course of the commencement or termination of the enterprise": s 195-1 of the GST Act. An important question then becomes whether Mr Russell was doing the works identified in "Stage 1" of the business plan (and making the creditable acquisitions in the course of doing those works) "in the course of the commencement" of the naturist retreat. Another way of asking the same question is sometimes to ask whether the "intention of the ... taxpayer is that the transaction is the first step in a business" ( Ell v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 61 ATR 661 at [114]. There can be a course of business even if there is "nothing more than an intention to carry on" a business: Fairwell Estates Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 29 ; (1970) 123 CLR 153 at 166. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 876">The business activities of the taxpayer include the long term investment in the [DEF] Unit Trust. In [2008] Administrative Appeals Tribunal Appeals Division 461, Re the Taxpayer and FCT it was accepted by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that in this case the taxpayer acquiring antiques and artwork for long term investment was carrying on an enterprise. The Tribunal's decision was affirmed in FCT v Swansea Services Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 402. ... The taxpayer's activities include the provision of the services of [Mr P] in the administration of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 94">14 The Commissioner's notice of appeal raised questions of law of the kinds identified in [13] above. As Allsop J said in Collins [2007] FCAFC 111 ; 163 FCR 35 at [55] , a question of law "directing the Court's attention to the manner in which the Tribunal failed to discharge its obligations according to law" is a "legitimate subject of an 'appeal'" under s 44(1) of the AAT Act and nothing in the cases "limits the reach of s 44 to questions of law divorced from the need to look at facts". None of the decisions in Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; 149 FCR 522 , Price Street Professional Centre [2007] FCAFC 154 ; 243 ALR 728 at [22] --- [27], Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooper (1991) 29 FCR 177 or Commissioner of Taxation v Swansea Services Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 402 ; [2009] FCA 402 ; (2009) 72 ATR 120 detract or depart from those principles: see Collins [2007] FCAFC 111 ; 163 FCR 35 at [55] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] ATODGSTD GSTD2009/D2">7. Even if it could be argued that an enterprise can still exist where there is a lack of regularity of activities, the activity must still reasonably be intended to be profit making (see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Swansea Services Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 402). </sentence>
