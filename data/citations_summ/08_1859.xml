<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] ACTSC 5">"Workplace" was defined in the Act as it was at the time of issue of the notice to mean any premises where employees or self-employed persons work. Counsel has been unable to identify any authority in this Territory in which the definition has been considered relevantly to the facts of the present case. He has taken me to decisions of the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission, including Workcover Authority (NSW) v Boral Johns Perry Industrial Pty Ltd trading as BoralElevators (Maidment J, 8 August 1996, unreported), in which His Honour determined that a lift in a residential building, maintained by the defendant through its employees, was not a place of work during periods when maintenance work was not being conducted at the site. This was in the context of a prosecution of the defendant for a breach of section 16 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 (NSW) requiring an employer to ensure that persons not in his employment were not exposed to risks while at his place of work. The decision had been followed with approval in other single-judge decisions of the Commission, as authority for the proposition that a place may be a place of work at certain times but not at others. The case was distinguished by Middleton J in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Smith [2008] FCA 1859 , in which His Honour determined that a Telstra pit with a lid, on a public footpath, was a workplace under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 (Cth), so that Telstra had a continuing obligation as to the safety of non-employees at or near such a pit, not only when Telstra staff were working in or in the vicinity of the pit. </sentence>
