 22 In the present case the factual denials set out in the affidavits by Mr and Mrs Matthews [the seventh and eighth respondents] do not descend to particulars or address the associated allegations made in the statement of claim about the use of their company's name [Versalife Pty Ltd, the sixth respondent, formerly known as Gold Leaf Enterprises Pty Ltd] in Thailand.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 964">The application of the principle established in Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson concerning contracts of employment has resulted in a divergence of Federal Court authority. A number of these have been referred to in the submissions above and I have been invited by Mr Heath to follow the authority of Barto v GPR Management Services Pty Ltd (supra) while Mr Britt submits that the conduct alleged was not in "trade or commerce". To resolve this divergence of view I am guided by the decision in Duncan v Lipcombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 at [32] - [33] where Heerey J reviewed these authorities. His Honour states: [32] ... In Barto v GPR Management Services Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 659 ; (1991) 33 FCR 389 Wilcox J held that information supplied to an employee in the course of negotiating a variation to his contract of employment was "in trade or commerce".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 957">In reaching this conclusion French J departed from the views of Heerey J in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc (2006) 150 IR 471 ; [2006] FCA 458 at [5] --- [6] that s.31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeout applications. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 363">As observed by Heerey J in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 ; (2006) 150 IR 471 , s 31A FCA was introduced to establish a lower standard for strike outs (either of claims or defences) than that previously laid down by the High Court's decisions in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner of Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. Nevertheless, while the test is lower, as Barrett J in Degiorgio v Dunn (No 2) [2005] NSWSC 3 ; (2005) 62 NSWLR 284 held, for the purposes of the comparable provision in New South Wales ('without reasonable prospects of success') meant 'so lacking in merit or substance as to be not fairly arguable'. In Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91 , Court of Appeal per Lord Woolf MR said at 92: 
 The words "no real prospect of succeeding" do not need any amplification, they speak for themselves. The word "real" distinguishes fanciful prospects of success ... they direct the court to the need to see whether there is a "realistic" as opposed to a "fanciful" prospect of success.

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 1389">Centrelink submits that under s.17A(3) of the FM Act, for an application to have no reasonable prospects of success, the application need not be hopeless or bound to fail . What must be shown is that: "[t]he allegations are 'so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed". [74] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 1374">Section 31A allows for "judgment" or nothing. Alternative remedies with respect to deficient pleadings must be found in the rules of Court.

' Finally, in Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 , Tamberlin J considered the meaning of the phrase "no reasonable prospects of success" at [12]-[13] in the following terms, which appear to me to build a bridge between the two strands of opinion in the Federal Court: Section 31A of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) was introduced to impose a lower requirement to dismiss an action by way of summary judgment than that which was imposed in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner of Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. In that case, the requirement was expressed in terms of "manifestly groundless" or "obviously untenable". However, the assessment of whether there is a reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding must depend upon the evidence and pleading the subject of the application. In Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1688 at [26] - [29] (decided on 5 December 2006) Mansfield J appeared to support the more liberal approach taken by Wilcox J, although the case was essentially decided on the basis of Anshun estoppel [5] . Further support for the approach taken by Wilcox J can be found in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227 (decided on 15 September 2006) at [9]-[11] per Moore J and Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 (decided 28 April 2006) at [6] per Heerey J.

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 1148">In this case the dispute is about the manner and form, essentially the calculation, of payment to the Applicant of superannuation entitlements and deductions for taxation. There is no conduct alleged which can be characterised as the negotiation of the terms of the contract for services between the Applicant and Respondent, or its variation. In Boase v Seven Network (Operations Ltd) a s.52 claim was struck out because the alleged representations were not alleged to have effected any variation in the plaintiff's contract of employment. [48] The dispute is simply one about the manner and form of payment, and whether the Applicant has been paid what he was contracted to be paid or entitled to be paid having regard to his entitlement to superannuation and the obligation to deduct taxation. That conduct, which relates to the implementation of the contract, cannot be characterised as bearing a trading or commercial character, and, is therefore, not in trade or commerce. [49] Even if it can be said to be in trade or commerce on a theoretical or very broad view of s.52 of the TP Act it is the Court's view that a dispute of this nature is not such as to impose responsibility or liability in accordance with the policy underlying s.52 of the TP Act . If the circumstances of this case fell within the ambit of s.52 of the TP Act there would be very little that would fall without that ambit. To find that the conduct here was in trade or commerce would be to invite the application of s.52 of the TP Act to all manner of disputes concerning payment, underpayment or non-payment, of entitlements under contracts (both of services (employment) or for services (principal and contractor)) which are in reality nothing more than ordinary contractual disputes for which ordinary contractual remedies, and sometimes statutory remedies, are available.

<sentence id="cs25" from="[2007] FCA 875">14 Section 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) empowers the Court to give summary judgment against an applicant if it is satisfied that the applicant has "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding". This is a less onerous test than that previously stated and applied in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130, namely that the allegations are "so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed". Section 31A was designed to make it easier for an opposing party to strike out a claim or defence: see Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at 158; Duncan v Lipscombe Charles Care Service Inc [2006] FCA 458 at [6] . Of course it is essential that the Court must be careful not to do an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings, or denying an applicant an opportunity to ventilate their case. However, in the present case, the material placed before the Court is not sufficient to satisfy the threshold raised by s 31A(2) because it does not raise a reasonable argument to the effect that there has been a contravention of the Act . The version of the evidence for which the applicant contends merely indicates a reference to the applicant's colour of skin or ethnic origin as a way of identifying her for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 (NSW), a piece of legislation which applies equally to people of any ethnic origin. Merely to identify a person by reference to characteristics of clothing, ethnicity or skin for the purpose of the application and enforcement of a generally applicable law is not a contravention of the Act . </sentence>

<sentence id="cs31" from="[2007] FCA 195">59 The further question is whether her Honour arguably erred in refusing leave to deliver a further further further amended statement of claim wholly re-pleading any claim in respect of which Mr Rogers might demonstrate standing and whether her Honour arguably erred in dismissing the proceedings pursuant to s 31A of the Act and also in reliance upon Order 20, rule 2 of the Federal Court Rules . Recently, French J in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No. 2) (2006) FCA 1401 observed that s 31A is not a vehicle for simply striking out parts of a pleading that are deficient. His Honour observed that alternative remedies arise under the Federal Court Rules to deal with deficient pleadings and that, in principle, recourse ought not to be had to s 31A of the Act which deals with entering summary 'judgment' in 'a proceeding'. His Honour, in consequence, respectfully disagreed with the approach adopted by Heerey J in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 in which Heerey J observed that s 31A of the Act was introduced to establish a lower standard for 'strike outs'. The question, relevantly in this case, the court asks, for the purposes of s 31A of the Act, is whether it can be satisfied that the applicant in the proceeding has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding. That state of satisfaction will rarely be achieved (except in the most transparent of cases) on the strength of a conclusion that the applicant's statement of claim is deficient either in whole or in part because, as French J observes, leave to re-plead might reveal material facts within a properly identified legal framework that, upon proof, gives rise to a recognised remedy. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs32" from="[2007] FMCA 145">In Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc (2006) 150 IR 471 ; [2006] FCA 458 (" Duncan ") Heerey J in the Federal Court said: 
 
 
 "a fundamental change to the standard to be applied in strikeout applications has been introduced by s. 31A [of the FCA Act ] ": Duncan IR at 473 per Heerey J; FCA at para 5 per Heerey J.</sentence>

147 A view has been expressed that the purpose of s 31A is to introduce a lower standard for summary dismissal and strikeouts under O 20 r 2 and O 11 r 6: cf Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 at [5-8] ; Wearne v Southern Cross University [2006] FCA 1033 at [13] and Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Limited [2006] FCA 1441 at [23] . It is unnecessary for me to decide this issue in the context of this matter. In my view the application of the applicant filed 7 April 2006 can be dismissed in accordance with either s 31A Federal Court Act or O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules , and I should so order. ORDER 
 
 1. The proceedings in QUD130/2006 commenced by application filed 7 April 2006 by the applicant be dismissed. 2. The applicant pay the costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be taxed if not agreed.

<sentence id="cs34" from="[2006] FCA 1441">Order 11 r 16 provides for the striking out of a pleading or any part thereof on the same ground. In dealing with summary termination and strike out applications the Court must assume that the applicant will be able, at trial, to establish its pleaded case and must treat the allegations made in the best light for the applicant. As was pointed out by Heerey J in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services [2006] FCA 458 ; (2006) 150 IR 471 at 473, s 31A was designed 'to establish a lower standard for strike outs ...' than that imposed in cases such as Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-2 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130, namely, that allegations had to be 'so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed. ' In Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v G E Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [31] to [48] Rares J concluded that, even though the barrier had been somewhat lowered by the introduction of s 31A , it nonetheless constituted a difficult obstacle for a respondent to surmount. His Honour said (at [45]) that:
 
 'I am of opinion that in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s 31A , the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by dismissing the proceedings where, in accordance with the principles in Hocking v Bell [1947] HCA 54 ; (1947) 75 CLR 125 contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs35" from="[2006] FCA 1401">Section 31A is not a vehicle for simply striking out parts of pleadings that are deficient. Section 31A allows for "judgment" or nothing. Alternative remedies with respect to deficient pleadings must be found in the rules of Court. In this connection I respectfully disagree with the approach taken by Heerey J in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 in which his Honour said (at [6]): 
 
 'Plainly s 31A was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeouts (either of claims or defences) than that previously laid down by the High Court's decisions in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1948) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130, namely that the allegations are "so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed".

<sentence id="cs36" from="[2006] FCA 1227">Merck submitted that the section provided a lesser test that the test which applies under the other provisions. It referred to observations of Heerey J in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 , in which his Honour said at [6]: 
 
 s 31A was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeouts (either of claims or defences) than that previously laid down by the High Court&#180;s decisions in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1948) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130, namely that the allegations are 'so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed'.

<sentence id="cs37" from="[2006] FCA 898">49 Because there is no jurisdiction for this Court to deal with various claims made it is not appropriate to consider whether any reasonable causes of action are raised. Such an exercise would amount to exercising a jurisdiction which the Court does not have. However, I should take this opportunity to correct an error I made in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 in relation to the new s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act which introduces for strikeout applications the lower threshold of "reasonable prospects of success" as against the test laid down in such cases as General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 150. I was not referred in Duncan to item 44 of Pt 2 of Sch 1 to the misleadingly titled Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 (Cth) (misleading because it applies to all litigation) which makes it clear that s 31A does not apply to proceedings commenced before that Act came into force.

<sentence id="cs38" from="[2006] FMCA 975">Heerey J, in interpreting the like amendment to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (s.31A) in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 , considered the amendments to be procedural rather than substantive and therefore to apply in relation to proceedings commenced before the amendments.</sentence>
