<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] QDC 154">" Preliminary discovery was also described as an "invasive process" in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2065 at [39] by Tamberlin J. Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2065 --- cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] WASC 147">There might be matters of defence which could defeat a prima facie case. In C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864 , Gyles J took the view, for the purposes of O 15A r 6(b) that a party was entitled to have more than a 'bare pleadable case' before deciding whether to undertake lengthy and expensive litigation of the kind contemplated in that case. Tamberlin J appears to have misstated this aspect of the reasons of Gyles J in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2065 when he suggested that O 15A r 6 was 'no longer appropriate' when an applicant had enough information to meet the threshold of a bare pleadable case. However, as his Honour said, the purpose of preliminary discovery is not to procure documents that would strengthen an applicant's decision to commence proceedings but rather to furnish it with information which is reasonably necessary to enable that decision to be made. In that connection he referred to his earlier decision in Matrix Film Investment One Pty Ltd v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591. 40 Order 26A r 4(1) prohibits the court exercising the power to grant preliminary discovery where the court finds that the applicant has already sufficient information to enable a decision to be made as to whether to commence or take the proceedings - as was the case in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2065. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 133">1 The applicant Optiver Australia Pty Ltd seeks to appeal from a judge's refusal to make an order for preliminary discovery under O 15A r 6 of the Federal Court Rules : Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2065. It is now not in dispute that the order of the primary judge was interlocutory and that leave is therefore required under s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCAFC 7">60 The boundaries of the sufficiency criterion have been discussed in various cases. In Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Ltd [1996] FCA 391 , Lindgren J held that r 6 was not necessarily rendered unavailable by the fact that the applicant already had available evidence establishing a prima facie case for the granting of relief. There might be matters of defence which could defeat a prima facie case. In C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864 , Gyles J took the view, for the purposes of O 15A r 6(b), that a party was entitled to have more than a 'bare pleadable case' before deciding whether to undertake lengthy and expensive litigation of the kind contemplated in that case. Tamberlin J appears to have misstated this aspect of the reasons of Gyles J in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2065 when he suggested that O 15A r 6 was 'no longer appropriate' when an applicant had enough information to meet the threshold of a bare pleadable case. However, as his Honour said, the purpose of preliminary discovery is not to procure documents that would strengthen an applicant's decision to commence proceedings but rather to furnish it with information which is reasonably necessary to enable that decision to be made. In that connection he referred to his earlier decision in Matrix Film Investment One Pty Limited v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 47">1 The notice of motion at present before the Court seeks that an application for leave to appeal against an interlocutory judgment of Tamberlin J ( Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2065) be heard and determined by a Full Court, that the appeal be heard together with the application for leave to appeal and that the hearing of the application for leave to appeal and the appeal be expedited. The respondents opposed the application for leave to appeal being referred to a Full Court and indicated that they do not agree, in any event, that the application for leave to appeal, if it is to be determined by a Full Court, should be heard at the same time as the substantive appeal. They opposed expedition.</sentence>
