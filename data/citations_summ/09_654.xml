<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1334">In this case, the Court notes that the proposed consent determination does not contain express provisions for extinguishment by pastoral improvements and the land reasonably necessary for the operation of them, an issue made relevant by the decision of the Court in De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290. However, the Court notes that the pastoral respondents to this proceeding have agreed to enter into the consent determination on the basis of an agreement with the applicant that a form of Indigenous land use agreement (body corporate agreement) (ILUA) under the provisions of Pt 2 , Div 3, Subdiv B of the Native Title Act will be executed upon or shortly after a determination and the vesting of native title in the Wyamba Aboriginal Corporation. A determination in this form was held to be appropriate by North J in Hunter v State of Western Australia [2009] FCA 654 , and I consider it also to be appropriate here. </sentence>
