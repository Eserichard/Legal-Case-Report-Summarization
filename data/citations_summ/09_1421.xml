 ... the trustee's right to remuneration is limited to work properly undertaken. In this context, "properly" means work reasonably and bona fide undertaken for the purpose of administering the estate or performing any public duty imposed by the Act, conformably with the trustee's duty to perform the work with reasonable care and skill and in an efficient and economical way. 
 

 
" There exists ", it has been said, " a public interest in ensuring that trustee's remuneration is open to objective scrutiny ": McKinnon v Pattison [2009] FCA 1421 at [40] per Marshall J.
