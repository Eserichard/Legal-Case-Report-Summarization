<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 126">The [Fund] relies in these proceedings upon the grounds stated in its Notice of Objection dated 16 May 2005. These review proceedings relate to the Decision at large, not merely to the Decision as it operated on up until 9 September 2005. See Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd [2006] FCA 1414 at [65] . Consequently, the Tribunal is obliged to consider evidence of the [Fund's] activities both before and after 9 September 2005. See Word Investments at [66]-[67].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] AATA 275">The Federal Court said the ITAA97 s 50-50(a) condition that required a charitable or religious institution to pursue "its objectives principally in Australia" was concerned with the nature of the institution's own actual conduct, The Court held that Word's only relevant conduct was the payments it made to Wycliffe. Those payments were made in Australia, and were in pursuit of its objectives. They therefore satisfied the endorsement entitlement condition. This was so irrespective of the place where Wycliffe might itself spend the money Word paid: [2006] FCA 1414 at [31] and [52].  The Commissioner's contention appeared to proceed on the basis that TACT's endorsement application, and thus both the Commissioner and the Tribunal's powers related only to the closed period between the effective date of the application and the refusal decision. However, as all the judges in the two Word decisions pointed out, the Commissioner's statutory power was to grant the application with effect from a date the Commissioner determined: [2006] FCA 1414 at [64] - [66] per Sundberg J; [2007] FCAFC 171 at [62] - [63] per Allsop J and [105] per Jessup J. Furthermore, once an endorsement decision was made, it continued to operate until the Commissioner withdrew the endorsement under ITAA97. In these circumstances it was open to the Commissioner, in the circumstances of the present case, to have granted the application on 9 September 2005 and if granted on that date, it would have continued to operate thereafter. The Tribunal's power is no more restricted. 
  The Commissioner contends that these donations preclude TACT from satisfying the requirement of ITAA97 s50-60(a) that it "pursued its charitable purposes solely in Australia". The Federal Court of Australia's decisions in Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd [2007] FCAFC 171 and [2006] FCA 1414 apparently contradict the contention, but they were concerned with the endorsement entitlement of a religious or charitable institution under ITAA97 s 50-50(a). The Commissioner says the decisions do not apply to the differently worded endorsement entitlement condition in ITAA97 s50-60(a).  The endorsement applicant in Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd [2007] FCAFC 171 and [2006] FCA 1414 was a company incorporated by Wycliffe Bible Translators (International). Wycliffe was itself an endorsed income exempt entity under ITAA97 subdivision 50B. Word Investments Ltd distributed the majority of its income to Wycliffe. Wycliffe conducted its activities, almost exclusively, outside Australia. The Federal Court recognised that the question of whether Word's payments were made pursuant to its charitable purposes did require some examination of the nature of Wycliffe's activities outside Australia. But it was not necessary to determine the actual way in which Wycliffe used the money it received from Word. The payments to Wycliffe were made pursuant to Word's charitable objectives if they were made in the belief that Wycliffe would use the money for relevant charitable purposes: [2006] FCA 1414 at [31] . The Federal Court applied similar reasoning to that which had been accepted by the English Court of Appeal in IRC v Helen Slater Charitable Trust Ltd [1981] Ch 79 ; [1982] Ch 49 - a case which also involved distributions made by one charitable organisation to another.  The endorsement applicant in Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd [2007] FCAFC 171 and [2006] FCA 1414 was a company incorporated by Wycliffe Bible Translators (International).

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 345">They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.
