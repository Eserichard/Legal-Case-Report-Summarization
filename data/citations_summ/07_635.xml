<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FamCAFC 240">In relation to interest up to judgment the rate of interest is normally not fixed or prescribed. For example there is no rate of interest prescribed in the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) and it remains for the exercise of judicial discretion. We observe that Order 35, rule 7A of the Federal Court Rules , which deals with interest up to judgment, provides that: 
7A If determining a rate of interest for an order under paragraph 51A(1)(a) of the Act, the Court or Judge may fix the rate as: 
 
(a) the cash rate of interest set by the Reserve Bank of Australia from time to time during the period mentioned in paragraph 51A(1)(a) of the Act, plus 4 per cent; or 
 
(b) such other rate as the Court or Judge thinks fit
 However, as Finkelstein J observed in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3 Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 635 (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Finkelstein J, 4 May 2007): As regards interest, TS&amp;B Retail, the successful applicant, seeks interest on damages in the amount of $200,000 for which judgment will be given. A successful plaintiff is entitled to interest on a judgment debt for the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date as of which judgment is entered unless good cause is shown to the contrary: Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 51A. The rate of interest is not specified in the section but is left to the judge's discretion.</sentence>
