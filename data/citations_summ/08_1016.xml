<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 495">There are few cases referred to in the commentary in the standard bankruptcy work and that is doubtless because only very rarely fortunately do these sorts of very regrettable circumstances arise. I have, however, been able to consult the decision of the Federal Court of Australia constituted by Lander J in the matter of Ambrose (Trustee) , in the matter of Re; Athanasas (bankrupt) (No 2) [2008] FCA 1016. That case involved a bankrupt who kept saying he would comply with the obligations with which we are concerned, but ultimately failed to do so. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1586">56 Decided in the Federal Court, Ambrose (trustee), Re; Athanasas (bankrupt) (No 2) [2008] FCA 1016 is a case concerning a bankrupt person who repeatedly failed to produce documents on summons. He pleaded guilty to failing to comply with statutory obligations to produce documents and failing to comply with an undertaking given to the Court by his then solicitor. In determining whether a sentence of imprisonment was appropriate, Lander J stated (at [63]-[64]):
 It is accepted that a sentence of imprisonment is a punishment of last resort. However, it is a punishment which must be imposed if it is necessary for the purpose of vindicating the Court's authority. In this case, Mr Athanasas is a bankrupt and it would seem to me that a fine would be inappropriate. Notwithstanding that imprisonment is a sentence of last resort, it seems to me, having regard to the conduct of Mr Athanasas over a very long period since the matter first came before the Registrar and since he first informed the Registrar he would comply with the summons, a sentence of imprisonment is necessary. </sentence>
