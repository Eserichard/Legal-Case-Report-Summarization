<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] ACTSC 50">) 
 
 In the present case, the first plaintiff obtained the letter upon which his claim is founded produced as a consequence of a subpoena to a third party in proceedings against the first defendant. The plaintiffs suggested that the rule was limited to documents obtained from a party to the litigation. However, United States Surgical Corp v Hospital Products International Pty Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division, McLelland J, 7 May 1982, BC8200010), Eltran Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1990) 25 FCR 322 , Welfare v Birdon Sands Pty Ltd (1997) 79 FCR 220 and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Rural &amp; General Insurance Ltd [2006] FCA 151 , 27 February 2006, Gyles J, are examples of documents that had been produced under subpoena by strangers to the litigation and such documents were held to be subject to the implied undertaking. Contrary to the plaintiffs' submission, the document in issue in this matter is subject to the rule. The application by the first plaintiff to the magistrate was based upon the qualification that a court may dispense with or modify the implied undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] NSWSC 521">The different positions arise because Ms Richards, notwithstanding that her client was not joined to the application, has been fully heard on the application. Joinder in circumstances such as these, whilst preferable, is not always critical. 5 Questions concerning the proper procedure to be adopted insofar as documents produced to the court on subpoena are concerned were raised for consideration in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Rural &amp; General Insurance Limited [2006] FCA 151 , Gyles J, 27 February 2006. His Honour relevantly observed [at 9 and 10] as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 [9] The documents concerned have an apparent relevance to the matter before the AAT, in the sense that that term is used in the judgment of Moffitt P in National Employers' Mutual General Insurance Association Ltd v Waind and Hill [1978] 1 NSWLR 372 , although I cannot conclude that they are central to that case or that they will ultimately be considered as significant, or even admissible, by the AAT. There is no doubting the importance of the appeal against a disqualification of this kind to the individual concerned.</sentence>
