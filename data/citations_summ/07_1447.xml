<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 193">The applicants referred to Irani v Hollyburton UK Ltd (2007) 163 FCR 329; [2007] FCA 1447 on the basis that in that case a creditor claimed interest in a bankruptcy notice but failed to set out a calculation of the amount of interest claimed. However Middleton J held that there was no defect or irregularity because there had been substantial compliance with the prescribed form and in the particular circumstances of the case the interest calculation was not made essential by the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 1">
 Section 306(1) of the Bankruptcy Act is as follows: 

(1) Proceedings under this Act are not invalidated by a formal defect or an irregularity, unless the court before which the objection on that ground is made is of opinion that substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and that the injustice cannot be remedied by an order of that court. 
 It is necessary to consider as a preliminary issue whether the bankruptcy notice failed to comply with the Bankruptcy Act and hence was defective or irregular, having regard to the operation of s.25C of the Acts Interpretation Act in relation to substantial compliance and all the circumstances of the case. If there is such a defect or irregularity it is then necessary to determine whether the defect or irregularity is "formal" within s.306(1) (see Irani v Hollyburton UK Ltd [2007] FCA 1447 ; (2007) 163 FCR 329 at [14] --- [17]). That question involves two levels of enquiry (see Irani , Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122 ; (2007) 157 FCR 313 per Jacobson J, Kleinwort Benson Australia Limited v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; [1988] HCA 34 ; (1988) 165 CLR 71 at [15] per Mason CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Gaudron JJ and Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 228 CLR 409 at [25] ff). The relevant enquiry at that point is whether the bankruptcy notice fails to meet a requirement made essential by the Bankruptcy Act or whether it could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice (in which case it is a nullity whether or not the debtor is in fact misled).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1085">In my view, the decision in Irani v Hollyburton UK Ltd [2007] FCA 1447 is also distinguishable. That case again concerned the inclusion of a claim for interest and Middleton J concluded at [17] that the failure to include an interest calculation did not satisfy the test of essentiality. However, in my view, the requirement to give the debtor the opportunity to pay the judgment debt in Australian currency and, for that purpose, to carry out the calculation required by "note 3" does satisfy that test of eventuality and the case is therefore distinguishable. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 485">It is necessary to consider first whether the bankruptcy notice failed to comply with the Bankruptcy Act , having regard to the operation of s.25C of the Acts Interpretation Act in relation to substantial compliance and all the circumstances of the case, and hence was defective or irregular. If there was such a defect or irregularity it would be then necessary to determine whether the defect or irregularity was a " formal" defect within s.306(1) (see Irani v Hollyburton UK Ltd [2007] FCA 1447 ; (2007) 163 FCR 329 at [14] --- [17]). This involves two levels of enquiry (see Irani v Hollyburton UK Ltd , Snelgrove v Roskell (2007) 157 FCR 313 per Jacobson J, Kleinwort Benson Australia Limited v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; (1988) 165 CLR 71 at [15] per Mason CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Gaudron JJ and Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 228 CLR 409 at [25] ff). In relation to s.306(1), it is necessary to consider whether the bankruptcy notice failed to meet a requirement made essential by the Bankruptcy Act or whether it could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what was necessary to comply with the notice. If so the notice would be invalid and should be set aside whether or not the debtor was in fact misled. In Irani v Hollyburton UK Ltd (at [17]) Middleton J stressed that these two aspects had to be addressed separately. If a defect was merely formal so that s.306(1) applied, consideration must be given to the issue of substantial injustice. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 487">It is necessary to consider first whether the bankruptcy notice failed to comply with the Bankruptcy Act , having regard to the operation of s.25C of the Acts Interpretation Act in relation to substantial compliance and all the circumstances of the case and hence was defective or irregular. If there was such a defect or irregularity it would be then necessary to determine whether the defect or irregularity was a " formal" defect within s.306(1) (see Irani v Hollyburton UK Ltd [2007] FCA 1447 ; (2007) 163 FCR 329 at [14] --- [17]). This involves two levels of enquiry (see Irani v Hollyburton UK Ltd , Snelgrove v Roskell (2007) 157 FCR 313 per Jacobson J, Kleinwort Benson Australia Limited v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; (1988) 165 CLR 71 at [15] per Mason CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Gaudron JJ and Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 228 CLR 409 at [25] ff). In relation to s.306(1), it is necessary to consider whether the bankruptcy notice failed to meet a requirement made essential by the Bankruptcy Act or whether it could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what was necessary to comply with the notice. If so the notice would be invalid and should be set aside whether or not the debtor was in fact misled.
