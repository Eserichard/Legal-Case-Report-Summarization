<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 277">Notice having been given, approval is now sought pursuant to s 33V and the " general power " conferred by s 33ZF. Section 33V provides as follows: 
 
 Settlement and discontinuance --- representative proceeding 
 (1) A representative proceeding may not be settled or discontinued without the approval of the Court. (2) If the Court gives such an approval, it may make such orders as are just with respect to the distribution of any money paid under a settlement or paid into the Court. 
 

 
The purpose to be served by s 33V has been said to be " obvious ": Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258. Branson J there observed: 
 
 
 The purpose intended to be served by s 33V(1) is obvious. It is appropriate for the court to be satisfied that any settlement or discontinuance of representative proceedings has been undertaken in the interests of the group members as a whole, and not just in the interests of the applicant and the respondent. In my view, s 33V proscribes not only complete settlement of proceedings without the approval of the court, but also settlement of claims against a joint respondent, or settlement of any substantive claim against a respondent. 
 

 
These observations have since been oft-cited: eg, Fowler v Airservices Australia [2009] FCA 1189 (" Fowler v Airservices Australia ") at [20] per Bennett J; Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 897 at [17] per Gordon J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 667">The task of the Court in determining whether approval should be given under s 33V of the FCA is to determine whether the proposed settlement or compromise is fair, reasonable and adequate having regard to the claims made on behalf of the Group Members who will be bound to the settlement and to be satisfied that any settlement or discontinuance of representative proceedings has been undertaken in the interests of the Group Members as a whole and not just in the interests of the Applicant and the Respondent: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258 and Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 897. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1189">In the present case, each Deacons client has had the benefit of advice from solicitors and counsel as to how his or her interests are best served in the litigation and by the proposed settlement. My task is to determine whether the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable having regard to the claims made on behalf of the group members who will be bound by the settlement ( Williams v FAI Homes Security Pty Ltd (No 4) (2000) 180 ALR 459 at [19] per Goldberg J). While the nine factor test adopted by Goldberg J in Williams is not a rigid test to be applied, it is useful as a guide ( Haslam v Money For Living (Aust) Pty Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 897 at [20] per Gordon J. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 572">I turn now to consider whether settlement of the proceeding ought to be approved under s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act . The relevant principles are now well settled: see, for example, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258 per Branson J; Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4 ) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2000) 180 ALR 459 at 465-6 [19] per Goldberg J; Neil v P &amp; O Cruises Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1325 at [6] - [7] per Weinberg J; Jarrama Pty Ltd v Caltex Australia Petroleum Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1114 at [10] per Crennan J; Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (No 5) [2004] FCA 1406 ; (2004) 212 ALR 311 at 317-8 [37] - [42] per Sackville J; Crawford v Bank of Western Australia Ltd [2005] FCA 949 at [16] - [21] per Lee J; Georgiou v Old England Hotel Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 705 at [18] per Young J; Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1388 ; (2006) 236 ALR 322 at 332 [30] and [31] per Jessup J; and Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 897 at [17] --- [20] per Gordon J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 19">He also said at [50]: 
 
 the court's function is, relevantly, confined to the question of whether the settlement was fair and reasonable. There will rarely, if ever, be a case in which there is a unique outcome which should be regarded as the only fair and reasonable one...the court should, up to a point at least, take the applicants and their advisers as it finds them...So long as the agreed settlement falls within the range of fair and reasonable outcomes, taking everything into account, it should be regarded as qualifying for approval under s 33V. 
 
 More recently in Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 897 Gordon J said at [19] to [20] said that she did not consider that the analysis undertaken by Goldberg J ought to be read as seeking to incorporate into Part IVA of the Act the requirements of the rules of court of an overseas jurisdiction. She said at [20]: 
 
 The analysis provided and continues to provide a useful guide in considering applications for approval under s 33V...It should, in appropriate cases and subject to the circumstances of any particular case, continue to be employed as a useful guide. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 2089">1 This is an application, under s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Act"), for the Court to approve a settlement of part of a representative proceeding. The details of the proceeding in which the application is made are summarised in the judgment of Gordon J in Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 897 at [2] - [4]. The settlement has been reached between certain of the applicants, acting on behalf of all group members, and the first and second respondents. It will be convenient to refer to it as "the MFL settlement". The terms of the settlement were contained in a deed dated 13 November 2007. The deed was a confidential exhibit in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 2008">65 More recently in Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 897 Gordon J said at [19] to [20] said that she did not consider that the analysis undertaken by Goldberg J ought to be read as seeking to incorporate into Part IVA of the Act the requirements of the rules of court of an overseas jurisdiction. </sentence>
