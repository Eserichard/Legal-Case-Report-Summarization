<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWSC 574">32 A number of cases has considered the question whether property contributed by a company or by third parties to be subject to a deed of company arrangement is held on trust for participating deed creditors or remains beneficially owned by the company prior to distribution to participating creditors. The principal authorities are Federal Commissioner of Taxation v All Suburbs Car Repairs Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1393 ; (1994) 14 ACSR 753 ; Dean-Willcocks v ACG Engineering Pty Ltd (in liq) [2003] NSWSC 353 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 290 ; Shepard v Sports Mondial of Australia Pty Ltd (in liq) [2005] NSWSC 432 ; (2005) 53 ACSR 746 ; Commonwealth of Australia v Rocklea Spinning Mills Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 902 ; (2005) 145 FCR 220 ; Lombe v Wagga Leagues Club Ltd [2006] NSWSC 3 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 387 ; Purchas, Re; Estore Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 1222 ; (2006) 154 FCR 246 and Parker, Re; Strongest Link Pty Ltd (in liq) [2008] FCA 1007 ; (2008) 250 ALR 118. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 515">The considerations referred to in the above passage are essential to the presence of a matter and therefore the jurisdiction of this Court under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act (see also Mentha v GE Capital Ltd (1997) 154 ALR 565 at 574 per Finkelstein J; Re Gidley [2006] FCA 102 ; (2006) 150 FCR 345 ; Purchas v Estore Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 1222 ; (2006) 154 FCR 246). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1007">45 That decision was followed by Gyles J in Purchas v Estore Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 1222 ; (2006) 154 FCR 246. His Honour said at [14] and [15]:
 Counsel for the plaintiffs has pointed out that there is an apparent division of opinion in the authorities upon the critical question. The decisions of Austin J in Dean-Willcocks v ACG Engineering Pty Ltd (in liq) [2003] NSWSC 353 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 290 and Campbell J in Sports Mondial favour the conclusion that the fund is held on trust for the deed creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] NSWSC 1049">21 The deed draws a distinction between "the Funds" (as defined) and "the Company's property" (undefined). I doubt that this is intended to indicate that "the Funds" are not property of the company (cf Federal Commissioner of Taxation v All Suburbs Car Repairs Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1393 ; (1994) 14 ACSR 753 ; Lombe v Wagga Leagues Club Ltd [2006] NSWSC 3 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 387 ; Re Purchas; Estore Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1222 ; (2006) 154 FCR 246 ; Purchas; Worldwide Workers Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1223). The indication is, rather, that such property of the company as is not within either of the two designated funds is to be dealt with, together with the property within the funds, in the ways specified in relation to "the Company's property and the Funds" --- while property within a particular fund (but not other property) is to be dealt with in the ways specified in relation to that fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 1329">The material facts in Purchas, in the matter of Estore Pty Limited (in liq) [2006] FCA 1222 and Purchas, in the matter of Worldwide Workers Pty Limited (in liq) [2006] FCA 1223 are indistinguishable in substance from this case. Directions will be given and an order for costs will be made for the same reasons as those appearing in the aforementioned cases. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 1223">The material facts in Purchas, in the matter of Estore Pty Limited (in liq) [2006] FCA 1222 , which has just been handed down, are indistinguishable in substance from this case. Directions will be given and an order for costs made for reasons given in that decision.
