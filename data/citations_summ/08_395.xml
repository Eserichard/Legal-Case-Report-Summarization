An "Appeal Statement" is defined in the FCR to be a statement "outlining succinctly the Commissioner's contentions and the facts and issues in the appeal as the Commissioner perceives them": O 52B r 5(3) of the FCR. They take the place of pleadings, but they are not, in substance, pleadings: WR Carpenter at [35]; McDonald's Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2008] FCA 395 ; (2008) 69 ATR 898 at [6] ; see also Pacific Exchange Corporation Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1155 ; (2009) 180 FCR 300 at [3] (cf Rio Tinto Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 335 ; (2004) 55 ATR 321 at [22] --- [27] and [58]). Their stated purpose is different --- to give each party and the Court a practical understanding of the parties' positions and summarise the essential issues on appeal: BAE Systems Australia (NSW) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation for the Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 48 ; (2008) 69 ATR 567 at [19] . Further, they are not subject to the same scrutiny as a pleading: BAE at [19]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 592">In Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1516 , Moore J held: 
 
 ... [A]ll s 25(2) does is confer appellate jurisdiction on single judges and Full Courts to deal with applications for leave to appeal. Order 52, r 2AA prescribes, in my opinion unexceptionably, the mechanism that determines whether this jurisdiction will be exercised by a single judge, on the one hand, or a Full Court, on the other. As Buchanan J correctly observed in McDonald's Australia Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2008] FCA 395 ; (2008 69 ATR 898 , referring to his Honour's earlier judgment in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 , the provisions of O 52, r 2AA admit no debate about the existence of any such right of election. There is none.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1155">It has been observed in prior authority that the purpose of the appeal statement is one of informing a taxpayer of the Commissioner's view, at that time, of the bases of the Commissioner's rejection of an assessment objection. In this regard, it has been said that its purpose is a practical one: see BAE Systems Australia (New South Wales) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 48 ; (2008) 69 ATR 567. It has also been observed that the appeal statement is not a pleading: McDonald's Australia Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2008] FCA 395 ; (2008) 69 ATR 898. So much may be accepted. It is nonetheless a feature of an appeal statement that it forms part of an obligation which the Court has to afford the parties to a proceeding procedural fairness. One of the ways in which that particular obligation is fulfilled is by ensuring that a party to a proceeding knows the case it has to meet. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1516">

4 Mr Harding has asserted a right to elect and sought to exercise that right by having his application for leave heard by a Full Court. A submission was made by counsel for Mr Harding that the issue of whether an application for leave to appeal is to be heard by a Full Court of a single judge is addressed by s 25(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (FC Act) and O 52 r 2AA could not modify the operation of the FC Act. However, all s 25(2) does is confer appellate jurisdiction on single judges and Full Courts to deal with applications for leave to appeal. Order 52 r 2AA prescribes, in my opinion unexceptionably, the mechanism that determines whether this jurisdiction will be exercised by a single judge, on the one hand, or a Full Court, on the other. As Buchanan J correctly observed in McDonald's Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (No. 2) [2008] FCA 395 , referring to his Honour's earlier judgment in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 , the provisions of O 52 r 2AA admit no debate about the existence of any such right of election. There is none.</sentence>
