<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1011">That proposition is not obscure or difficult but has been applied on a large number of occasions. Gordon J collected many of those decisions in Cadbury Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited (No. 2) [2009] FCA 663 at [7] to which I would add, only to underscore how basic and well-expounded the principle is, the decision of Jacobson J in ICAP Australia Pty Ltd v BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 467 at [13] - [14] and my own decision in Media Ocean Ltd v Optus Mobile Pty Ltd (No. 1) [2009] FCA 421 at [2] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 300">10 In ICAP Australia Pty Ltd v BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 467 , Jacobson J referred at [13]-[17] to the competing considerations involved in an application to release a legal adviser from a confidentiality undertaking to permit the disclosure of documents to a party, including the right of a party to litigation to know the case it has to meet and to properly instruct solicitors and counsel. His Honour in that case granted access to nominated representatives of the respondent to each class of documents in dispute on the basis that the documents, although confidential, went to important matters in the proceedings and that the respondent would be prejudiced in its defence without access to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 421">Optus challenges the entitlement of the applicants to make a claim resisting production of the documents to anyone other than the external lawyers for Optus. Ordinarily, the fact that documents are confidential is not sufficient to prevent their inspection. So much appears from the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Mobil Oil Australia Ltd v Guina Developments Pty Ltd [1996] VicRp 54 ; [1996] 2 VR 34 at 38 per Hayne JA (with whom Winneke P and Phillips JA agreed); see also ICAP Australia Pty Ltd v BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Limited [2007] FCA 467 at [13]---[14] per Jacobson J. The rationale underlying that principle is that in an ordinary case the obligation resting upon litigants not to use documents or information acquired as a result of the compulsory processes of the Court, other than for the purposes of the litigation, is a sufficient protection for any confidentiality which inheres in the material. </sentence>
