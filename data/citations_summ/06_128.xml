<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 80">44 The parties made brief submissions as to costs. Suntory submitted that the case raised novel and difficult questions of law, particularly in relation to the interpretation of the Excise Act and that it was in the public interest that these issues be settled. For that reason it was submitted that the usual rule as to costs should not apply. Counsel for Suntory referred the Court to observations made in Saga Holidays Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 128 at [4] and to the decision of the Full Federal Court in Ruddock v Vadarlis (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 237. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCAFC 191">56 The Commissioner cross-appealed from the decision of the primary judge relating to costs ( Saga Holidays Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 128). His Honour had accepted Saga's submissions that there ought to be no order as to costs, since the case was in the nature of a test case and the Commissioner had waited until immediately before the hearing to concede the correctness of a substantial part of Saga's claim. In particular his Honour stated: 'In my opinion the litigation raised important and difficult fiscal issues in particular on the construction of the legislation' and referred to at least 100 foreign tour operators affected by the outcome of the litigation.</sentence>
