 (a) the Court is satisfied that the application in issue has not been amended since consideration by the Registrar, and is not likely to be amended in a way that would lead to a different outcome once considered by the Registrar; and
 (b) in the opinion of the Court, there is no other reason why the application in issue should not be dismissed.
