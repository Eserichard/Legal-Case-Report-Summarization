 Introduction 
 The plaintiffs seek to recover their legal fees from the defendant. They had a written retainer from him. The second is the conclusiveness of the result of the trial before Lander J, whether that be by way of a judgment of the court or by way of a settlement consent order (see Simington v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2006] FCAFC 118 at [27] to [30] and Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 60 at [29] and [31]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 167">31 Ground 4(d) of the amended notice of appeal, it will be recalled, claimed that the learned primary Judge had caused his discretion to miscarry by taking into account an irrelevant matter, namely that the application to set aside the costs order should have been made in the proceedings previously dismissed by Finn J; see [2007] FCA 60. Counsel for the respondents argued that this ground was misconceived, referring to Chamberlain v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 21. In that case, a Full Court of this Court held that the Commissioner of Taxation, who was moving to set aside a consent judgment, should have raised it in proceedings in the High Court after which the Commissioner had been precluded by res judicata from seeking to recover the balance of a debt which had not merged in the consent judgment. That result flowed, the Full Court held, from the application of the principle enunciated in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589. The same principle, which had been invoked in the petitioning creditors' written submissions at first instance, was, it was submitted on behalf of the present respondents, fatal to the appellant's prospects of setting aside the consent costs order or, at least, was a relevant matter weighing against the discretionary grant of an adjournment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 561">I can make such an assessment in the present circumstances because that is the assessment of the respondent himself. In his affidavit, he discloses that he requires pre-action discovery to "determine whether I have any cause of action against [the applicants] to set aside the costs agreement". In addition, given the lengthy procedural history, there is a real risk that any subsequent application by the respondent to set aside the costs order will be met with the claim that he should have raised all the matters he wished to raise in that regard in his claim for damages against the applicants in the proceedings which were determined on 7 February 2007 adversely to him, that is the decision of Finn J referred to above: Cirillo [2007] FCA 60. See for example Chamberlain v Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 21. I note further that there has been no appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of South Australia given in matter 1481/1985 on 28 February 2003 dismissing the respondent's claim for an inquiry as to the loss he had suffered by reason of the injunction, nor any appeal from the costs order which followed it. 20 In addition, the conduct of the respondent to date does not indicate that he has chosen to focus his putative attack on the costs order in a sensible way. The applicants have had to confront the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice, apparently on the basis of allegations the same as or very similar to those which are the essence of the presently asserted reason not to make the sequestration order. As noted above, despite that, the respondent declined to that time to seek to set aside the consent order or, as apparently is now more appropriate in his view, to seek pre-action discovery before determining whether he has a proper foundation to do so. The applicants have also had to confront a claim in this Court by the respondent for procuring the costs order by failing to disclose certain documents which (it was alleged) was in breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1975 (Cth) and gave rise to a claim for damages under s 82 of that Act and in tort. It was claimed that the quantum of that claim gave rise to a set-off sufficient to defeat the costs order. That claim was dismissed by Finn J on 7 February 2007: Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Pty Ltd (Formerly known as Citicorp Australia Limited) [2007] FCA 60. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 179">
 
1 In Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Pty Ltd (formerly known as Citicorp Australia Limited) [2007] FCA 60 I have ordered that the application be summarily dismissed against all respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 139">3 This matter has an exceptionally long history which some number of Judges both of this court and of the Supreme Court of South Australia have been obliged to narrate in detail. In my judgment in Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Pty Ltd (formerly known as Citicorp Australia Limited) [2007] FCA 60 I set out a chronology at some length. I will not repeat it here other than to say that Mr Cirillo sought an inquiry as to damages in respect of an undertaking given when an injunction was awarded against him in 1985 restraining him from dealing with a particular piece of property described as "the Poclain". That injunction lapsed in February 1993 and the inquiry was sought in respect of that period.</sentence>
