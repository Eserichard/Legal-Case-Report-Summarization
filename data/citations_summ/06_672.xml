<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1456">3 Conti J dismissed an appeal from that decision: SZEOX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 672. Initially, the applicant had been represented by counsel before Conti J, but counsel withdrew from the proceedings. His Honour noted that there was no basis on which Lloyd-Jones FM had erred in dismissing the claim that the tribunal had been biased or made its decision in bad faith. Conti J concluded that the applicant's submission comprised simply an assertion, in effect, that the tribunal's decision was erroneous and that it should be returned to the tribunal for a fresh hearing. His Honour concluded, and I agree, that it was inevitable that orders should be made that the appeal be dismissed.</sentence>
