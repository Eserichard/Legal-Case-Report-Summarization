<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 374">Charles has since been applied by other single judges: see Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [68] (per Weinberg J); Maghiar v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 262 at [18] (per French J); and Stanislawa Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1492 at [4] (per Tracey J). More recently a Full Court, in Hurst v State of Queensland [2006] FCAFC 100 ; (2006) 151 FCR 562 , accepted that s 46PO(3) imposed "temporal limits" on any claim brought under s 46PO(1). The Court was referred to Charles and its reasoning proceeded on the basis that Charles was correctly decided. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1449">42 Justice Weinberg has usefully set out some other key aspects of the HREOC Act in the recent decision of Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [14] to [20]. I should note that Ms Bahonko submitted that the decision of Weinberg J should not be followed. However, leave to appeal from that decision was refused by Tracey J in Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1492 and in my respectful view, the statement of the relevant principles as set out by Weinberg J is correct.</sentence>
