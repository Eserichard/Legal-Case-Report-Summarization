10 This section has been the subject of previous judicial analysis: e.g. Golden Editions Pty Ltd v Polygram Pty Ltd (1996) 61 FCR 479 ; see also Boyapati v Rockefeller Management Corporation [2008] FCA 995 ; Milwell Pty Ltd v Olympic Amusements Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 63 ; (1999) 85 FCR 436 ; Sheldon &amp; Hammond Pty Ltd v Metrokane Inc [1999] FCA 63 ; (2004) 85 FCR 436 ; Cody Opal (Australia) Pty Ltd v Dimasi [2004] SASC 357 ; (2004) 64 IPR 378 ; Kalamazoo (Aust) Pty Ltd v Compact Business Systems Pty Ltd (1985) 84 FLR 101. Adopting the language of Burchett and Tamberlin JJ in Golden Editions at 480 when considering a s 115(3) defence:
 
 
 [I]n general the question is not whether [Vawdrey] knew the identity of the owner of the copyright but whether [Vawdrey] has established a lack of awareness, and of reasonable grounds for suspecting, that the relevant act was an infringement of the copyright, in whomsoever that copyright might be vested.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1375">1 On 2 July 2008, I delivered reasons for judgment upholding the applicants' claim for infringement of copyright in 800 questions and answers in practice exams that MedEntry, a business operated by the applicants, sold as part of a preparation course for the Undergraduate Medicine &amp; Health Sciences Admission Test ("UMAT") and dismissing the cross-claimants' cross-claim. By their cross-claim, the cross-claimants alleged: (1) copyright infringement in 160 of the questions and answers in the 800 questions and answers the subject of the applicants' claim; (2) defamation; and (3) passing off and conduct in contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth): see Boyapati v Rockefeller Management Corporation [2008] FCA 995 (" Boyapati (No 1) ").</sentence>
