<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 504">In Rana v Musolino [2009] FCA 1050 , Finn J concluded that the applicant could not challenge the Trustee's decision to discontinue the proceeding in the High Court, because the cause of action relied upon was not one for damages for personal injury or wrong done to him so as to fall within the compass of s 60(4) and 116 (2)(g) of the Act.  The first claim is for a declaration that the applicant has the right to seek special leave to appeal from the High Court of Australia in respect of the decision of McKerracher J in Rana v Musolino [2010] FCA 476. The character of the proceeding about which the applicant seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court has already been decided by Finn J in Rana v Musolino [2009] FCA 1050 and affirmed by McKerracher J in Rana v Musolino [2010] FCA 476. The applicant is attempting to have those decisions reviewed through a back door. Moreover, he has not gone any distance at all to show that those decisions are erroneous.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] SADC 147">Accordingly the Master was not satisfied that the plaintiff was claiming for personal injury severed from the plaintiff's property rights which were legitimately the entitlements of his creditors. [18]  In addition it involves the complex question of the right of an undischarged bankrupt to claim, after his bankruptcy, for "personal injury without reference to his rights of property". [10] The history of the litigation 
 The subject proceedings were issued on 2 May 2003, namely after the sequestration order was made. The accompanying Statement of Claim was grossly inadequate. The defendants sought an order that the plaintiff's claim be dismissed on the bases that the Statement of Claim did not disclose an arguable cause of action; that it was statute barred; and that the defendants were immune from any such cause of action. HELD: appeal dismissed. Bankrupty Act 1966 (Cwth) s58(1)(a); District Court Act 1991 s24 , s 43 (2)(a); District Court Rules 1987 rr3.01, 3.04 and 46.18, referred to.
