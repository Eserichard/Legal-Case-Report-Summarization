<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] WASC 19">57 It is plain that the Ann Street Mezzanine Proceedings are complex: see Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) v Beck [2009] FCA 333 ; (2009) 255 ALR 324. They are connected to the collapse of the Westpoint Group of companies and there are several other proceedings which are closely related: see Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) v Beck [2010] FCA 260 [1]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSC 556">38 Fourthly, proceedings before a Court will be stayed as an abuse of process if it amounts to a collateral attack on the judgment in the earlier proceeding. Consistent with the principle that a person who has a full opportunity to present their whole case will not be permitted to reargue the case, if a person stands by and waits to see the outcome of a case in which they have a distinct interest without making themselves a party, they will be bound by the result and will not be allowed to reopen the issue in another piece of litigation. [49] As I have held, Dr Kermani had that opportunity but stood back, without making herself a party. In my view, it would be an abuse of process for Dr Kermani to re-litigate the same issues in these circumstances. Dr Kermani cannot escape that consequence because Whelan J and the Court of Appeal did not allow the guarantors to put their illegality argument in the way in which I have held that the claims in this proceeding also raise in substance. The second proceeding finally determined the dispute between SGB and the guarantors based on the costs agreement. The defendants in the second proceeding are bound by the Court of Appeal decision. In my view it would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice and bring the system into disrepute to allow Dr Kermani effectively to make a collateral attack on the refusal of the Court to allow the additional claims to be raised, by raising them in this proceeding in the circumstance where she stood by and waited to see the outcome of the second proceeding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] HCATrans 85">It is called Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) v Beck , and the media neutral citation is [2009] FCA 333.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] WASC 141">65 Similar issues arose in Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Beck [2009] FCA 333 where Finkelstein J had occasion to consider an application to strike out a cross-claim because of alleged issue estoppel affecting a party with alleged privity of interest. In that case, the question was whether or not a finding of insolvency at a particular date could be challenged by a party who was a shareholder in the company held to have been insolvent at a later date in separate proceedings. In that case, his Honour said at [25]:
 
 The principle that parties and their privies cannot call into question an issue of fact or law that has been resolved between them in litigation is referred to as estoppel by record or issue estoppel. In Blair &amp; Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Curran Adams' Will [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 532 Dixon J explained that issue estoppel as to facts is confined to 'those ultimate facts which form the ingredients of the cause of action' and 'the actual ground upon which the existence of the right was negatived'. He went on to say that subsidiary or collateral findings are not covered by the estoppel. The question here is not whether the findings of insolvency are ultimate findings, for they plainly are. Rather, the question is who is bound by them. </sentence>
