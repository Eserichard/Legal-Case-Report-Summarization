<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 820">His reasons should not be read as if he did so. In the absence of evidence about what occurred at the hearing, the appellant has no sufficient evidential basis for the grounds he seeks to raise, thus he has not, in our opinion, established that the Tribunal did not comply with the rules of natural justice. 
This has been followed subsequently in SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134 at [21] and SZILD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1703 at [14] . </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 911">The basis upon which the second Tribunal decision was challenged before the Federal Magistrates Court was apprehended bias on the part of the Tribunal. In this Court that ground is not repeated in the notice of appeal. Rather the notice of appeal contains two grounds which are as follows: His Honour erred in failing to find that the Second Respondent failed to take into account relevant considerations. 
Particulars
 
 
(a) The Second Respondent failed to consider whether or not the Appellant, by reason of his status as a repatriated asylum seeker, member of the ethnic majority belonged to a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention. His Honour, bound by authorities of this Court, erred in failing to find that the Second Respondent breached section 424AA of the Migration Act and in failing to find that the Second Respondent's breach of section 424AA gave rise to jurisdictional error. 
Particulars
 
 
(a) The Appellant asserts that a number of matters decided by this Court were wrongly decided in relation to this point, including, but not limited to SZLXI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1270 and SZLWI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1330.  As to ground 2, there are decisions of judges of this Court in respect of s 424AA which hold that the extending of an oral invitation to provide information in response to particulars furnished by the Tribunal is permissive, rather than a matter of obligation. See SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 ; (2008) 103 ALD 589 ; and SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134. The ground of appeal invites me not to follow those decisions. I would only do that if I were persuaded that they are clearly wrong. On its face, the language of s 424AA is eloquent in the contrast between the use of the word "may" in para (a), and the use of the word "must" in para (b). As a matter of construction, it seems to me that para (a) of s 424AA is, indeed, permissive. I am not persuaded, on the basis of that examination, that either of the decisions mentioned should not be followed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 558">As the Tribunal has a complete discretion to invoke the provisions of s 424AA , it was not necessary for the Tribunal to comply with section 424AA. Finally, non compliance with the provision (even if embarked upon) would likely not amount to jurisdictional error in any event: see SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 per Tracey and Foster JJ at [103] --- [104], Moore J agreeing at [1]. [15] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 471">There are a large number of authorities to support the above. (See SZMMP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 per Lander J at [63], and also SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 per Cowdroy J, SZMAE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 per Edmonds J, SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1866 per Middleton J, SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 per Gilmour J and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 per Jaggot J, cited in SZMMP at [63] and in SZMCD at [98]. See also SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [99] . ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCAFC 46">98 At [63] of his Honour's reasons, his Honour noted that his Honour's decision was consistent with decisions of other judges of this Court in SZLXI [2008] FCA 1270 (Cowdroy J), SZMAE [2008] FCA 1701 (Edmonds J), SZITH 105 ALD 541 , [2008] FCA 1866 (Middleton J), SZLWI [2008] FCA 1330 ; 171 FCR 134 (Gilmour J) and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 (Jagot J). 48 Counsel for the first respondent submitted that the only consequence of non-compliance with the specific requirements of s 424AA is that the Tribunal does not get the benefit of the provisions of s 424A(2A). It was submitted on behalf of the first respondent that this interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions was supported by five cases in this Court, namely: SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] ; SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 103 ALD 589 , [2008] FCA 1270 at [27] ; and SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134 at [19] ; SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 at [23]; and SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 105 ALD 541 , [2008] FCA 1866 at [56] ---[60]. Each of those cases was decided by a single judge sitting on appeal from a Federal Magistrate. The decisions contain the views of five judges of this Court. Each authority is recent. They constitute a consistent body of recent authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 299">Ms Nolan submitted that if the Applicants wished to challenge the Tribunal's decision on the basis that it failed to comply with s.424AA there was an onus to put on evidence, such as a transcript ( NAOA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [13] and also SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [14] at [21]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 296">Moreover as Gilmour J pointed out in SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134 (at [19]): Section 424AA does not impose any obligation on the Tribunal. It enables the Tribunal, if it chooses to do so, to give oral particulars of adverse information to an applicant at a hearing that may otherwise need to be given in writing under s 424A(1). 
Hence, if there is a failure to comply with the requirements of s.424AA(b) , the consequence is not jurisdictional error, but rather that the exception in s.424A(2)(a) is not engaged and the Tribunal is obliged to comply with s.424A. If the Tribunal is obliged to comply with s.424A then the exceptions in s.424A(3) are applicable. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 305">I have also been referred to the decision of Gilmore J in SZLWI v The Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 where his Honour said at para.19: Section 424AA does not impose any obligation on the Tribunal. It enables the Tribunal if it chooses to do so to give oral particulars of adverse information to an applicant at a hearing that may otherwise need to be given in writing under sub-s.424(1). SZMCD v The Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1039 at [56] . If the Tribunal chooses to give oral particulars of information under s.424AA but fails to comply with the requirements of s.424AA(b) the consequence is not that it falls into jurisdictional error. The consequence is that s.424A(2)(a) is not engaged. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FMCA 233">While the majority found the Tribunal's failure in that case had been a breach of the obligation to accord procedural fairness, and that, therefore, there was jurisdictional error, all allowed for the possibility that the discretion may be exercised to withhold relief (but found that there was no such reason evident in the case before them to do so). I note also what was said in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 ; [2007] HCA 26 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ at [29] on the issue of the exercise of discretion: "The present is a case in which no useful result could ensue from the grant of the relief desired by the appellants. This is so because, even if the appellants be correct as to the proper operation of s 424A, they cannot overcome the Tribunal's finding that their claims lacked the requisite Convention nexus ..." See also, for example, VQAN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigensous Affairs [2003] FCA 1541 ("VQAN") Heerey J. at [23] stated: "... [T]he court should proceed to reach a final conclusion one way or the other on the substantive merits and, if satisfied that a case of jurisdictional error is made out, then consider whether relief should be refused because of delay or other discretionary factors ..." In addition to the guidance provided by authorities referred to above, I am also guided by the approach taken by Gilmore J in SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 , a matter also involving s.91R(3) (but with different circumstances to the ones presented in the current case). Nonetheless, I note the following (at [45]): "[45] The first respondent submits that even if there has been a breach of s 91R(3), the Court should refuse relief in its discretion. There is merit in the submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCA 233">The applicant's contention as to the construction in s 424AA has been considered and rejected by other members of the Court in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 (Cowdroy J), SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 (Edmonds J), SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1866 ; (2008) 105 ALD 541 (Middleton J), SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 (Gilmour J) and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 (Jagot J). Although the reasons in those cases may not be as these reasons, I agree in the results. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FCA 217">... 

 
In MZXLB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1588 at [14] , Finkelstein J referred to NABE and observed that " (t)here is no precise standard for determining when an issue is 'raised squarely', but it is clear the tribunal is obliged to consider any claim that is apparent on the face of the material before it ". See also: SZEIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798 at [30] to [31] and [56] to [57] per Bennett J; SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 599 ; Kasupene v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1609. That which is not to be permitted is for a claimant to " reformulate his claims on an ex post facto basis ": SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [23] , 171 FCR 134 at 140 per Gilmour J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FMCA 224"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FCA 83">Section 424AA itself imposes no obligation upon the Tribunal. It provides an alternative means by which the Tribunal may give to the applicant 'information' that it is otherwise required to give in writing pursuant to s 424A(1) of the Act. A jurisdictional error will only arise if there is a breach of s 424A ( SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 at [23] ---[28]; SZLWI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [17] ---[21]; SZLQD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] ). There was no 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1) , and s 424AA was not engaged. I agree with these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] FMCA 91">Nor is there any evidence that the applicant claimed a subjective fear of persecution in China by reason of his alleged practice of Falun Gong in Australia. Accordingly, the first respondent submits that the alleged Falun Gong practice in Australia did not engage s 91R(3) and therefore this section did not require the Tribunal to make a finding of fact, or a finding as to the applicant's motives, in relation to it. Discretion to refuse relief If, contrary to the above submissions, the Court finds that the Tribunal breached s 91R(3) , the first respondent submits that the Court should exercise its discretion to refuse relief because the breach did not affect the outcome of the Tribunal decision (see SZLWI v MIAC [2008] FCA 1330 at [45] ; SZJZN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 519 at [41] ; SZMAN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1351 at [31] - [38]; SZJHG v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2007] FMCA 2050 at [47] - [48]). The Tribunal took into account the applicant's conduct in Australia in the context of considering a possible sur place claim which was not articulated by the applicant, to the applicant's benefit. The Tribunal did not rely on the conduct in Australia to find against the applicant and would have come to the same conclusion if it had made a s 91R(3) finding and disregarded the conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] FMCA 8">That testimony constituted information that was given by the Applicant to the Tribunal for the purpose of her application for review and was thereby excepted from s 424A(1) obligations by reason of s 424A(3)(b): NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [41] - [64]; VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 at [48] ; SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35]. Further, the Tribunal's appraisal of that testimony was not information: SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [18] . Accordingly, in circumstances where no s 424A(1) obligations arose there can be no jurisdictional error based on s 424AA and in any case there is insufficient evidentiary basis for inferring a breach of s 424AA: SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [19] - [21]; NAOA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 241 at [21] . Further, in respect to the Tribunal's obligation under s 425 , the Tribunal was not obliged to provide the Applicant with a running commentary on her testimony: SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 at [48] . It was natural and obvious that the Tribunal would hold suspicions about the disparate claims made by the Applicant at the hearing. Counsel for the applicant also made oral submissions in which she contended, by reference to the court book and the transcript, that a particular social group claim fairly arising from the available material had not been considered in any meaningful sense by the Tribunal. Counsel also submitted "formally" that the Federal Court's interpretation of s.424AA of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act ") in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1270 at [27] and SZLWI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1330 was wrong and that my interpretation of the section in SZLTC v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 384 at [15] - [16] should be preferred. That was a formal submission because I am bound by the Federal Court decisions in SZLWI and SZLTC to the extent of inconsistency with my own. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FCA 1866">58 It has been held on a number of occasions in this Court that ss 424AA and 424A provide specifically how certain matters are to be brought to the attention of an applicant by a tribunal, and that s 424AA enables information which would need to be given in writing under s 424A to be given orally if an applicant appears before a tribunal: see SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] per Marshall J; SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 at [27] per Cowdroy J; SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134 , 139 at [19] per Gilmour J; and SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 at [23] per Edmonds J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FMCA 1606">Mr Godwin referred the Court to SZJHG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [23] at [47], SZMAN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [24] at [31]-[38], SZJZN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [25] at [40] and SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [26] at [45]-[46] in support of the proposition that the Court should exercise its discretion and refuse to grant relief in the circumstances. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2008] FMCA 1538">In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant submitted that relief should not be withheld in the exercise of discretion on the basis that there was, for the purposes of considering the exercise of discretion, no relevant distinction to be drawn between this case and the cases considered by the Full Court in SZJGV . Counsel for the Minister submitted that no relevant distinction was there to be made on the basis that any error in this case was not to the applicant's detriment in the disposition of the case. Counsel for the Minister drew my attention to the decision of the Federal Court in SZLWI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1330 , in particular at [35] and the decision of this Court in SZMAN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1351. Counsel for the Minister sought to distinguish cases involving breaches of s.91R(3) from cases involving a breach of the code of procedure by the Tribunal involving procedural fairness considerations that were dealt with by the Full Federal Court in SZIZO v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCAFC 122. Consideration
 I accept in general terms the Minister's submission identifying the issues arising from the decision of the Full Federal Court in SZJGV .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] FMCA 1686">As stated in SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134 at [19] , s.424AA does not impose any obligation on the Tribunal. It enables the Tribunal (if it chooses to do so) to give oral particulars of adverse information to an applicant at a hearing that may otherwise have to be given in writing under s.424A(1). If the Tribunal chooses to give oral particulars of information under s.424AA but fails to comply with the requirements of s.424AA(b) the consequence is not that it falls into jurisdictional error. Rather the consequence is that s.424A(2)(a) is not engaged. Section 424A(2)(a) exempts the Tribunal from the obligation to give written particulars of information in s.424A(1) if it has given clear particulars and invited comment or response under s.424AA. It is also relevant to note that in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 1270 ; (2008) 103 ALD 589 at [27] Cowdroy J expressed the view that while s.424AA does not contain a provision equivalent to s.424A(3) , " what is not 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1) of the Act is also not 'information' for the purposes of s 424AA. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2008] FCA 1701">23 In any event, the Minister submitted that no jurisdictional error arises. Section 424AA itself imposes no obligation upon the Tribunal. It provides an alternative means by which the Tribunal may give to the applicant 'information' that it is otherwise required to give in writing pursuant to s 424A(1) of the Act. A jurisdictional error will only arise if there is a breach of s 424A ( SZLXI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 at [23] --- [28], SZLWI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [17] --- [21], SZLQD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] ). There was no 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1) , and s 424AA was not engaged. I agree with these submissions.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2008] FMCA 1547">I note that, when considering whether the Tribunal met its obligations under s.424AA it is now established (see SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 , SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 , and SZMDJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1298) that s.424AA does not itself impose any obligation on the Tribunal, but rather enables the Tribunal, if it chooses to do so, to give oral particulars of adverse information to an application at a hearing that may otherwise need to be given in writing under s.424A. If the Tribunal chooses to do so but fails to comply with the requirements of s.424AA(b) as Gilmour J stated in SZLWI at [19] "... the consequence is not that it falls into jurisdictional error " but rather that s.424A(2A) , which exempts the Tribunal from the obligation to comply with s.424A where it has given clear particulars of the information and invited the applicant to comment under s.424AA , would not apply. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] FMCA 1463">The Minister submits that even if a breach of s.91R(3) were established the Court should exercise its discretion to refuse relief (see SZLWI v Minister for immigration and Citizenship [19] at [44] and [45]). It would be appropriate to decline relief on discretionary grounds because no injustice has occurred ( SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [20] at [50]-[53]; M v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [21] at [38]; SZKGF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [22] at [13]-[16]). Conclusions
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] FMCA 1386">The Tribunal Member did not commit any jurisdictional error. In the alternative, assuming the Court does not accept that the Tribunal disregarded the applicant's conduct whilst in Australia in its findings in paragraphs 120 to 122, then the first respondent submits that the Court should refuse to grant the constitutional writ relief on discretionary grounds. In a recent decision of the Federal Court (on appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court) Gilmour J held in SZLWI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1330 (" SZLWI ") that where findings in respect of conduct engaged prior to coming to Australia independently support the Tribunal's conclusion on the question of persecution, then the Court should exercise its discretion and refuse to grant the relief sought. That is because the Tribunal has independently found a basis for rejecting the applicant's refugee claims and there would be no purpose in granting relief against the Tribunal in those circumstances. In SZLWI Gilmour J said (at [45]): The first respondent submits that even if there has been a breach of s.91R(3) , the Court should refuse relief in its discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2008] FMCA 1351">In SZJGV the Full Court left open issues that did not need to be determined on the case before it, including whether a distinction might be drawn between an applicant's conduct and the reason or reasons for which that conduct had occurred. Subsequently in SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 Gilmore J found that in the case before him the finding that the appellant was not a committed Christian in China were discrete from the findings concerning activities in Australia. The same may be said in this case about the finding that the applicant was not a committed Falun Gong practitioner. Hence the findings about the appellant's practices in China did not depend upon any conduct in Australia. In contrast in SZJXO (one of the cases considered in SZJGV) the finding that there was no real chance of the appellant being persecuted by reason of her religious beliefs on her return to China was derived from evidence which was intermixed, including her conduct in Australia. </sentence>
