<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 33">Equally, a failure to expressly mention particular material is not conclusive that it has not been taken into account. A decision-maker is not normally required in its reasons for decision to refer to " every item of evidence that was before it " and an " omission to refer to a piece of evidence does not necessarily require a conclusion that it has been overlooked ": cf. SZEHN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1389 at [58] per Lindgren J. See also: SZHPI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 306 at [15] per Branson J; Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 at [64] , [2008] FCA 236 ; 101 ALD 245 at 259 per Bennett J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] AATA 114">Mr Richards referred to [53, 56 and 57] of Bennett J's decision in Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 ; (2008) 101 ALD 245 in support of his argument that because the Respondent had not had the opportunity of reviewing a claim for nature and conditions , the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain such a claim by Mr Szabo. He referred to Bennett J's statements as follows from Sellick : 
 
 53 In Abrahams v Comcare [2006] FCA 1829 ; (2006) 93 ALD 147 , Madgwick J recognised that different descriptions can be given of the one injury and said at [18] that 'a broad, generous and practical interpretation' should be made to recognise the understanding of the lay person making the claim and different levels of medical advice and to understand whether the lay person completing it was asserting a different injury to that notified. The Tribunal said that, in applying the principles in Abrahams, it was satisfied that the proper interpretation of the claim made by Mr Sellick was for 'an injury which caused pain in the upper back, which included, but was not limited to, pain in the area of the right scapula'.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 807">Such duplication of proceedings is, in my view, most undesirable. It may be that Parliament intended that there be both a limited right of appeal from a decision of the Tribunal pursuant to s 44 of the AAT Act and a right to judicial review pursuant to the ADJR Act. Such intent would seem unlikely, save for the presence of para (y) in Sch 1. The exclusion of one category of Tribunal decisions, and the exclusion of one sub-set of that category, suggest that it was intended that Tribunal decisions be generally reviewable under the ADJR Act. The availability of two avenues for review raises the likelihood of multiple proceedings with attendant additional cost. Some consideration should be given to legislative clarification of the position so that the duplication of proceedings can be avoided. In any event it is appropriate that, despite my personal reservations, I follow the decision of Bennett J in Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 ; (2008) 245 ALR 561 at 580-582. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCAFC 146">3 The error of law asserted by the applicant was that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT) erred in concluding, based upon the judgment of Bennett J in Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 ; (2008) 101 ALD 245 , that it was confined to determining whether the applicant was entitled to compensation in respect of soft tissue injury to his shoulder. That was the decision of the AAT: see Sellick v Australian Postal Corporation [2009] AATA 158 at [31] . In effect, the AAT concluded that it could not give consideration to what Bennett J at [71] of her reasons referred to as the "additional conditions", namely aggravation of a degenerative condition of the spine, and chronic strain of interspinous ligament. As indicated, we agree with Buchanan J that the AAT properly concluded that it was confined to consider whether the soft tissue injury to the right shoulder of the applicant had resolved. Her Honour considered that the scope of the decision reviewable by the AAT in respect of pain in the right shoulder was so limited, applying Lees v Comcare [1999] FCA 753 ; (1999) 56 ALD 84.  10 The decision of the AAT was appealed to this Court under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). On 7 March 2008 Bennett J found that the AAT had committed errors of law with respect to each claim and remitted each matter for further attention ( Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1149">The applicant did argue before the Tribunal that his underlying condition had been aggravated by his employment in the sense contemplated by the definitions in s 4 of the Act. The argument was not developed much but this does not detract from the fact that the argument was put. The Tribunal was obliged to turn its mind to the argument and to deal with the question of aggravation. It was a significant part of the applicant's case before the Tribunal. The argument was seriously advanced by the applicant and was worthy of serious consideration. Whilst it is true that the Tribunal is not required to consider and address every submission made to it, serious submissions of the type to which I have just alluded must be addressed ( Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 79 ALR 267 at 276---277 per Jenkinson J). It is an error of law for the Tribunal not to consider such a submission and not to reveal its consideration of that submission in its Reasons for Decision (see Hartnett v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2004] FCA 50 at [50] ; and Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 ; (2008) 245 ALR 561 at [88] ---[89] (pp 579---480)). This statement of principle is consistent with the more general statements of principle directed to giving content to the concept of error of law made by the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Hill [2002] FCAFC 192 ; (2002) 69 ALD 581 at [59] (pp 597---598). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1057">To the extent that the Corporation in the present appeal seeks to raise a contention as to whether or not there was " any evidence " in support of particular findings, it may be noted that in Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 at [91] , 101 ALD 245 at 264, Bennett J observed that " [a] decision made under an enactment is invalid if there is a total absence of evidence to satisfy an essential element of the decision ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 302">The law is clear that failure to consider a submission of substance which, if accepted, would be capable of affecting the outcome of the case, constitutes an error of law ( Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184 ; Casarotto v Australian Postal Corporation [1989] FCA 116 ; (1989) 86 ALR 399 at 403; Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v FCT (1988) 79 ALR 267 at 276; Sellick [2008] FCA 236 at [35] ). Was the submission of the Authority in relation to previous consideration of the issue of Mr House's personality disorder a submission of substance? In my view it was. While the Tribunal was not necessarily bound by its early decision --- indeed the decision of the Full Court in Morales [1998] FCA 334 ; (1998) 82 FCR 374 indicates that the issue was one of discretion --- nevertheless the submission should have been considered by the Tribunal in reaching its decision. Failure by the Tribunal to do so in my view constitutes an error of law. Second and third grounds of appeal
  Clearly a failure by the Tribunal to advert to the content of submissions does not of itself necessarily mean that the matter was not considered ( Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v National Health and Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265 at 279, Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 at [35] ). However in this case, aside from a bare reference by the Tribunal to the existence of its 2004 decision (at [4]), there is no indication that it had taken into consideration the submission of the Authority concerning previous consideration by the Tribunal of issues relating to Mr House's personality disorder. This absence of reference to its earlier decision is particularly surprising where the Tribunal has found that Mr House had greater incapacity than that found by the Tribunal in 2004, notwithstanding the evidence before the Tribunal in these proceedings that, between August 2001 and November 2004, inter alia , Mr House had stopped drinking ( House [2008] AATA 38 at [15]), was no longer an active alcoholic ( House [2008] AATA 38 at [52] ), and Mr House was maturing and less affected by his personality disorder ( House [2008] AATA 38 at [60] ). </sentence>

 REASONS FOR DECISION 
 
 12 March 2009 Justice Tamberlin, Presidential Member
J. W. Constance, Senior Member
Dr M. D. Miller AO, Member 
 
 These reasons relate to claims for rehabilitation and compensation by Mr Allan Sellick associated with his duties in relation to the sorting and delivery of mail whilst in the employ of the Australian Postal Corporation (Australia Post). The matter has been referred back to this Tribunal for further consideration as a consequence of a decision of Bennett J delivered on 7 March 2008: see Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 wherein her Honour found that the Tribunal in an earlier decision of 1 March 2007 made errors of law in its reasons. The errors of law found by her Honour involved determinations that the Tribunal had failed to consider certain submissions and evidence or give proper reasons in relation to the way in which conditions arose out of the claimed injury.  In Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 , Bennett J reasoned that in finding liability under the SRC Act for additional conditions which had not been the subject of a Notice of Injury under s 53, a claim for compensation under s 54, a determination under s 60, or the first reviewable decision under s 62 and an application to the Tribunal under s 64, the Tribunal had failed to observe the limitations on its jurisdiction flying from these provisions, and that the procedural prerequisites to entitlement to compensation had not been observed. Section 53(1) of the Act provides for Notice of Injury or loss of or damage to property and reads: 
 (1) This Act does not apply in relation to an injury to an employee unless notice in writing of the injury is given to the relevant authority: 
 (a) as soon as practicable after the employee becomes aware of the injury ... section 54 provides that compensation is not payable to a person under the Act unless a claim for compensation is made by or on behalf of the person under s 54.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] AATA 1155">Ms Henderson acknowledged that Madgwick J in Abrahams indicated a broad interpretation was appropriate, but submitted that Ms Weekes had made a compensation claim in 2007, but that the notice of injury pursuant to section 53 had not been given back in 2003/4 when the injury was claimed to have occurred. She submitted notice and a claim were two different things. She submitted that Ms Weekes' telling Ms Ottway about wanting a job on the counter could not amount to notice of an injury under the Act, and in fact maintained that no notice of any injury had been given in 2004. Ms Henderson submitted that the 2007 claim form, which is the only claim Ms Weekes has submitted, did not mention aggravation of injury, and if Mr Richards now submitted that the claim was for two injuries, or for aggravation, then Ms Weekes had to claim separately for each. ( Australian Postal Corp v Sellick and Anor [2008] FCA 236 ; (2008) 101 ALD 245). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 988">29 Whilst it is the case that the Tribunal is required to consider the substance of the claims that are made that could affect the outcome of the review, the Tribunal does not have to deal with every point raised by an applicant ( Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 at 641, Casarotto v Australian Postal Commission [1989] FCA 116 ; (1989) 86 ALR 399 at 402-3, Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 at [35] ). In this case, the Tribunal was undertaking a merits review. It was empowered on the review to exercise the same powers as an authorised review officer. There is no doubt that an authorised review officer has the power under s 135 of the Act to vary the decision of a Centrelink officer or to set it aside and substitute a different decision.</sentence>
