<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 615">Ms Rees seeks judgment under O 35A r 3(2) of the Federal Court Rules . That rule provides that if a respondent is in default, that the Court may: 
 
 (c) if the proceeding was commenced by an application supported by a statement of claim or the Court has ordered that the proceeding continue on pleadings --- give judgment against the respondent for that relief: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the applicant appears entitled to on the statement of claim; and 
 (ii) the Court is satisfied it has power to grant; or 
 
 
 
 
 (d) give judgment or make any other order against the respondent; 
 

 The provisions of O 35A r 3 marked, at the time of their introduction, a departure from the former requirement that evidence needed to be put before the Court before a judgment of that kind could be given: see, for example, Luna Park Sydney Pty Ltd v Bose [2006] FCA 94 at [17] - [18] per Jacobson J. However, it has been accepted in this Court by a number of judges that the effect of O 35A r 3 is to dispense with that requirement and that it will be sufficient, instead of evidence being put before the Court, that 'on the face of the statement of claim there is a claim for relief sought and that the Court has jurisdiction to grant that relief': Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 1Cellnet LLC [2005] FCA 856 at [14] per Nicholson J citing Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 433 at [3] per Heerey J; see also Luna Park Sydney Pty Ltd v Bose [2006] FCA 94 at [20] per Jacobson J ; Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 at [57] per Kenny J; Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A company incorporated in Hong Kong (No.2) [2009] FCA 887 at [19] - [20] per Logan J; Turner; in the Matter of LA Technologies Pty Ltd (in Liquidation) [2009] FCA 805 at [13] per Gordon J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 340">Order 35A rule 3(2)(c) FCR may be invoked upon an event of default of a kind prescribed in O 35A r 2(2) FCR, and contemplates that judgment may be given against a respondent for relief to which the applicant appears entitled "on the statement of claim" and which the Court is satisfied it has "power to grant". In determining the relief, O 35A permits regard to be had to the "face of the statement of claim"; no evidence need be adduced to prove the factual contentions; allegations of fact in the statement of claim are deemed admitted: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 ; (2007) 244 ALR 300 at [42] . See also: Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 at [57] ; Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 433 at [3] per Heerey J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 1 CellNet LLC [2005] FCA 856 at [14] per Nicholson J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Albert [2005] FCA 1311 ; (2005) 223 ALR 467 at [6] - [7] per Jacobson J; Deisel Spa v Hwang [2005] FCA 1619 at [2] per Tamberlin J; Macquarie Bank Ltd v Seagle (2005) 146 FCR 400. The facts set out under paras 5(b), 6(b), 7(b) and 8(b) above constitute events of default pursuant to O 35A r 2 (2)(b) of the Federal Court Rules . </sentence>

 97 In Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [78] Kenny J also considered an application for summary judgment under O.35A of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 885">The applicants rely particularly on O 35A r 3(2)(c) of the Rules, which does not require proof by way of evidence of their claim. Instead, on the face of the statement of claim, there must be a claim for the relief sought and the court must have jurisdiction to grant that relief: see Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 433 at [3] per Heerey J; Diesel SPA v Hwang [2005] FCA 1619 at [2] per Tamberlin J; Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 at [57] per Kenny J; and HIT Entertainment Ltd v Lodin [2006] FCA 722 at [5] - [6] per Stone J. Having read the statement of claim, I find that these conditions are satisfied. O 35A r 3 is, nonetheless, discretionary and the circumstances attending the application must be taken into account. In some circumstances, although not here, it is appropriate to exercise some caution before granting relief: see Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey t/as DVD Kingdom [2006] FCA 727 ; (2006) 232 ALR 525 at 527 [10] per Sackville J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCAFC 149">14 In our view these comments apply with equal force to the discretion which the Court is presently required to exercise under O 35A r 3(1) (cf Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1718 at [23] and Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 at [48] - [51]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 548">18 This statement has been referred to and adopted in many subsequent cases (see, as examples only, Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 at [48] --- [50], Sheikholeslami v Brungs [2006] FCA 933 at [16] --- [17] and Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [25] ). In my respectful view it is equally apposite in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 372">Mr Mosley submitts that the Tribunal was not required to consider whether the applicants' failure to seek State protection was reasonable, in light of its finding that effective protection was available. He referred to the following authorities. "The point was considered by the Full Court in SZDWR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 36 [1] . the Full Court said: 18 The Australian jurisprudence on the issues of persecution and State protection do not support the notion of a third category of persecution. In Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 at 233 (referred to with approval in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; [2004] HCA 18 ; [2004] 205 ALR 487 ; HCA 18 at [19] ("S152/2003"), Brennan CJ said that the definition of refugee must be speaking of a fear of "persecution that is official, or officially tolerated or uncontrollable by the authorities or the Courts of the Refugee's nationality".</sentence>

9 Order 35A rule 3 (2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules is predicated upon an event of default of a kind prescribed in O 35A r 2(2), and contemplates that judgment may be given against a respondent for relief to which "the applicant appears entitled on the statement of claim" and which the Court is satisfied it has "power to grant". In determining the relief, O 35A permits regard to be had to the "face of the statement of claim"; no evidence need be adduced to prove the factual contentions; allegations of fact in the statement of claim are deemed admitted: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 at [42] ; Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 at [57] ; Macquarie Bank Ltd v Seagle [2005] FCA 1239 ; (2005) 146 FCR 400. The findings set out at paragraphs 4(b) and 6(b) above constitute events of default pursuant to O 35A r 2(2)(b). The findings set out at paragraphs 5(b) and 7(b) above constitute events of default pursuant to O 35A r 2(2)(a). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] FCA 1321">
 This proceeding commenced on 9 May 2003, with the filing by Ms Wu (referred to hereafter as the applicant) of an application and statement of claim. The history of the proceeding can be ascertained by reference to Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 and Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 792.

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2006] FCA 933">

17 In that case, the Court emphasised at 396 that even in circumstances where each non-compliance is minor - and that is not the situation in this matter- the cumulative effect of an applicant's defaults may satisfy a Judge that an applicant is unwilling to cooperate, or for some reason, is unable to do so. This conclusion would not readily be reached, but where it is reached, fairness to the respondents can require the summary dismissal of the proceedings. This principle has also been applied in later cases: see for example Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 ; Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1718 ; Brown v Zomba Music Publishers Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 324. In my view, having regard to the way in which the matter has been conducted by the applicant and the detailed submissions and evidence adduced by the respondents, these principles must apply in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2006] FCA 792">5 On 3 February 2006, I delivered reasons for judgment concerning the applicant's motion for default judgment and made the orders that Mr Armitage now seeks to have set aside: see Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 (" Wu "). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2006] FCA 727">8 Order 35A has been interpreted as dispensing with the invariable requirement that the applicant prove by evidence that the pleaded claim is well-founded. In Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 , Kenny J (at [57]) said this:
 
 'Under the former O 10 r 7, an applicant was required to file proof by way of evidence of his or her claims when seeking judgment ... Under the new O 35A r 3, it now seems that reliance may be placed on the allegations in the relevant statement of claim. Judges of the Court have held that the rule does not require proof by way of evidence of the applicant's claim, but that on the face of the statement of claim there is a claim for the relief sought and that the court has jurisdiction to grant that relief: see Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 433 , at [3], per Heerey J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 1 CellNet LLC [2005] FCA 856 , at [14], per Nicholson J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Albert [2005] FCA 1311 , at [6]-[7], per Jackson J and Deisel Spa v Hwang [2005] FCA 1619 , at [2], per Tamberlin J. ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2006] FCA 94">20 Recent authorities support the proposition that Order 35 does not require proof by way of evidence of the claim. It requires that on the face of the statement of claim there is a claim for relief sought and that the court has jurisdiction to grant that relief: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 1Cellnet LLC [2005] FCA 856 per Nicholson J at [14] and Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Limited [2005] FCA 433 ; cf Wu v Avin Operations Pty Limited (ACN 076 956 913) [2006] FCA 36 at [49] , [57] --- [58]. </sentence>
