<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 822">Dr Bell's submission was that, at least with respect to documents which have been admitted into evidence, exceptional circumstances are required for an application under O 46 r 6(3) to be refused. [34] It is true that in ACCC v ABB Finkelstein J expressed the principle in terms which reflect Dr Bell's submission. It is also true that Sackville J has expressed his agreement with the passage of the judgment; Seven Network at [25]; see also Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation v Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations [2006] FCA 606 at [14] . But in my opinion, Seven Network and other relevant authorities do not establish a rule that there must be exceptional circumstances for an application to be refused. [35] As Sackville J observed in Seven Network at [24], O 46 r 6 does not confer a right on a non-party to obtain access to documents admitted into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 123">It is, therefore, appropriate to permit access to the affidavits read on the applicant's and respondents' behalf unless there is good reason not to do so: see, eg Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation v Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations [2006] FCA 606. An order under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), or if there was some other legislative provision which directed that certain information be regarded as confidential, would probably displace that starting point: Churche v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (No 3) [2006] FCA 1168. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 783">34 It is true that in ACCC v ABB Finkelstein J expressed the principle in terms which reflect Dr Bell's submission. It is also true that Sackville J has expressed his agreement with the passage of the judgment; Seven Network at [25]; see also Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation v Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations [2006] FCA 606 at [14] .
