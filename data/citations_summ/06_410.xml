<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1561">159 I accept the evidence of Mr Mantach as to what he was told by Nicolas Robinson. Although as counsel for the Robinsons stressed, there was no contemporaneous note (other than the reference to 200 acres) and the conversation occurred some ten years ago, the fact that there was a conversation about the cropping area is corroborated by the valuation report itself made at the time, albeit that it creates a misleading impression. Although the Robinson brothers were present in the court for most of the hearing, they did not give evidence. I think the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 entitles me to infer that their evidence on this critical issue would not have assisted them. There is added significance in the fact that the absent witnesses are a party, and a person closely associated with that party in the matters the subject of the litigation: Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity 1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 410 ; (2006) 150 FCR 494 at [52] .</sentence>
