<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 60">The Court refers to the decision of Collier J in SZINP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1747 at [26] as follows: "Decisions of the Tribunal are privative clause decisions and as such are not open to review on the facts: S157/2002 v Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476. As is clear from such cases as Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 and NAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 76 errors of fact do not give rise to jurisdictional errors". 
And at [29]:
 
 "if the Tribunal made an error of fact, it is not a jurisdictional error if there is some evidence upon which the finding of fact could be made: Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 at [36] , Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 ". 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 752">The limitation is extremely confined". 

 The Court does not find the decision to be so unreasonable that no repository of the power could have taken it. As stated by Collier J in SZINP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1747 at [29] : 
 
 "if the Tribunal made an error of fact, it is not a jurisdictional error if there is some evidence upon which the finding of fact could be made: Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 at [36] , Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 ". 
 
The issue the applicant seeks to agitate is no more than an impermissible attack on the factual finding of the Tribunal. The challenge is no more than an invitation to review the merits.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 1148">The Court finds that there was evidence before the Tribunal on which its finding of fact that the LTTE were not in the East at the relevant time could be made. A jurisdictional error has not been established. Even if that assessment is incorrect, and the Court will not be drawn into an assessment of the merits, there were other independent reasons for not finding the applicant to be a credible witness and for rejecting his claims.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 1349">Mr Cleary contends that it is well-established that an error of fact does not amount to jurisdictional error: NAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 76. More recently in SZINP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1747 at [26] and [29] Collier J stated: [26] In the absence of particularisation it is difficult to deal with this ground of appeal. Decisions of the Tribunal are privative clause decisions and as such are not open to review on the facts: S 157/2002 v Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476. As is clear from such cases as Attorney-General (NSW) v Quinn (1990) 170 CLR 1 and NAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 76 errors of fact do not give rise to jurisdictional errors... [29] While the appellant may feel that insufficient weight was ascribed to evidence which he considered important, it is clear that: &#8226; the weight given by the Tribunal to evidence before it, both oral and written evidence, is a matter for the Tribunal in its role as the arbiter of fact: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 , and &#8226; if the Tribunal made an error of fact, it is not a jurisdictional error if there is some evidence upon which the finding of fact could be made: Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 at [36] , Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510. </sentence>

" </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 215">20 Section 483 is clear in its terminology and meaning. The amendments to the Migration Act in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Act 2001 (Cth) and the 2005 Act do not remove a right of judicial review of Tribunal decisions. They confer jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Court to review those migration decisions for which jurisdiction is not conferred on the Federal Court by s 476A and to place statutory limits on a statutory right of appeal. Justice Besanko observed in Epenisa v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 ; (2007) 44 AAR 456 at [11] , on the subject of the limitation imposed by s 483 of the Migration Act , that s 44 of the AAT Act is a statutory right of appeal and ' there is nothing to prevent Parliament from excluding from its purview a certain class of decision '. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 251">

7 A decision or purported decision to cancel a visa under the Migration Act is a privative clause decision or purported privative clause decision within the meaning of s 474(3)(b) Migration Act . In this case, it is clear that the decision of the Tribunal, which reviewed and affirmed the decision of the Minister's delegate to cancel the applicant's visa under the Migration Act , was also a privative clause decision or purported privative clause decision. Accordingly, an appeal to the Federal Court from a decision of the Tribunal concerning such a decision does not lie within s 44 AAT Act , and is not competent (cf Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 and Boyes v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 505). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FCA 1747">29 While the appellant may feel that insufficient weight was ascribed to evidence which he considered important, it is clear that:
 
&#8226; the weight given by the Tribunal to evidence before it, both oral and written evidence, is a matter for the Tribunal in its role as the arbiter of fact: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 , and
 
&#8226; if the Tribunal made an error of fact, it is not a jurisdictional error if there is some evidence upon which the finding of fact could be made: Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 at [36] , Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FCA 1742">20 The appellant sets out factual claims at length in his affidavit, complains that the Tribunal did not take into account evidence he submitted to it, and complains that the Federal Magistrate relied on the findings of the Tribunal. However:
 
&#8226; the claim of the appellant is misconceived to the extent that he believes that either the Federal Magistrates Court or this Court can review findings of fact of the Tribunal. The only basis upon which an appeal lies from a privative clause decision within the meaning of s 474 Migration Act is on the basis of jurisdictional error of the Tribunal - not alleged errors of fact: S157/2002 v Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 4. To that extent, it is appropriate for the Federal Magistrates Court and this Court to rely on the factual findings of the Tribunal except to the extent that a finding is not based on any evidence: Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 at [36] 
 
&#8226; the appellant has not particularised the alleged breach of s 422B Migration Act . However in any event there is no evidence before me that the Tribunal failed to apply procedural fairness as required by the provisions of Pt 7 Div 4 of the Migration Act , including consideration of relevant material before it, in deciding whether the appellant was a person to whom Australia owed protection obligations within s 36(3). I accept the submission of the respondent that the Tribunal questioned the appellant about issues in respect of which the appellant presented evidence which the Tribunal considered vague and/or unsatisfactory, and allowed the appellant every opportunity to present information and his full case
 
&#8226; in relation to the claim of the appellant in his affidavit that the "respondents did not bother to look into" a relevant claim, it is clear that the Tribunal is under no duty to inquire: Gummow and Hayne JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21-22
 
&#8226; although the appellant claimed that there was a denial of natural justice by the Tribunal in using "its traditional wording for refusal of the case", this is not a competent basis for appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2007] FMCA 829">Likewise, an error of fact might, depending on its nature, indicate that the decision-maker did not give proper and genuine consideration to a matter he or she was bound to consider which is a jurisdictional error: see Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 at [36] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2007] FCA 505">7 When these grounds are considered, it is apparent that pro bono counsel for Mr Boyes framed them as if this were an application for judicial review, doubtless because he was aware that an appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act was incompetent: see ss 474 and 483 of the Act . On judicial review, the Court cannot set aside the decision of the Tribunal except for jurisdictional error: see Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506-508 and 511 per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ; and Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 at [4] - [12] per Besanko J.
