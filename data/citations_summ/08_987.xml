<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 705">The admissibility of evidence on an application for judicial review of an administrative decision will depend on the ground of review and the circumstances of the case: McCormack v The Commissioner of Taxation [2001] FCA 1700 ; (2001) 114 FCR 574 at [38] - [40] per Sackville J. The touchstone for the determination of admissibility will usually be relevance. That is, is the evidence sought to be adduced relevant to the ground of review sought to be relied upon? Ordinarily there is no reason, in a case involving judicial review, for any evidence to be placed before the court, apart from evidence of what was before the decision-maker at the time of the decision: Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446 at [442] per Weinberg J. However, the admissibility of evidence not before the decision maker depends upon the grounds of review on which the application relies: Attorney-General for the Northern Territory v Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (1989) 23 FCR 536 at 539-540 per Lockhart J; Australian Retailers at [455]; Attorney-General (NT) v Hand (1988) 16 ALD 318 at 319-320 per Wilcox J; and Saint v Holmes [2008] FCA 987 ; (2008) 170 FCR 262 at [54] per Siopis J. </sentence>
