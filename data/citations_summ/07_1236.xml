 On 16 September 2005, Mr Carman complained to the Commissioner of Equal Opportunity ("the Commissioner") that Torrens Transit Services (North) Pty Ltd ("Torrens Transit") had discriminated against him by denying him access to employment contrary to the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 ("the Act").

 TARR v TORRENS TRANSIT SERVICES (NORTH) PTY LTD 
 [2008] SAEOT 12 

 

 Introduction 
 
 Mr Tarr complained to the Commissioner of Equal Opportunity ("the Commissioner") that Torrens Transit (North) Pty Ltd ("Torrens Transit") had discriminated against him contrary to the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 ("the Act"). The Commissioner attempted to conciliate the complaint, but was unsuccessful, and therefore referred the complaint to this Tribunal pursuant to s 95(8) of the Act for hearing and determination. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] SAEOT 2">It is clear to us from Ms Colquhoun's evidence that she has experienced an injury to her feelings within the meaning of s 96(3) because of the actions of the club. She has experienced hurt and disappointment over a number of years because of the actions of the Club, and there is now little foreseeable prospect that she will ever attain her objective of becoming a member. In all of the circumstances, we believe an award of $10,000 in damages is appropriate. In fixing that amount, we have considered the range of damages awarded in Equal Opportunity cases (eg Forest v Queensland Health [2007] FCA 1236 , Cross v Hughes &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 976 , Abdulla v Berkeley on Hindley Street P/L [2005] SAEOT 2 , Abdulrahman v Toll Pty Ltd trading as Toll Express [2006] NSWADT 221 , Molesworth v Campbell and Patcono Pty Ltd [2004] QADT 30 , Bellamy v McTavish &amp; Pine Rivers Shire Council [2003] QADT 15).

 ADMINISTRATIVE LAW - ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS 
 
 Orders sought by complainant following Tribunal's finding that the respondent breached the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 - power of the Tribunal to make certain orders considered - award of $10,000 in damages to the complainant and order for the publication of an apology by the respondent to the complainant. Equal Opportunity Act 1984 s 93(2), s 96; Associations Incorporation Act 1985 , referred to.
