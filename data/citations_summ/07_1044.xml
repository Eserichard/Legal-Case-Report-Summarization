<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] WAICmr 12">Because the dictionary definition provides only limited assistance to me, I have also had regard to decisions in other jurisdictions which, while not binding or determinant of the correct interpretation, I consider are a useful guide to the interpretation of similar language as used in the exemption in clause 14(5). In Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 123 , the Full Court of the Federal Court considered an appeal against a decision of Goldberg J of the Federal Court (in P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Limited [2007] FCA 1044) to reject the objection of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to the production of certain documents on the ground of public interest privilege because the documents would ' tend to reveal' the identity of an informer.
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 364">The practice whereby the Court gives leave for subpoenas to be issued against a third party pursuant to O 27A has survived the introduction of O 15A Federal Court Rules providing for orders of the Court relating to non-party discovery. In relation to a third party, it is clear that a subpoena duces tecum may be directed to a third party prior to trial: 
 where it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice and the proper and expeditious conduct of a proceeding that a person produce documents before the date of hearing of the application. ( Hughes v WA Cricket Association (1986) 66 ALR 541 at 543; cf P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd [2007] FCA 1044 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at 57 [23] )

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 1266">The relevant principles that apply in a determination to set aside a subpoena are considered in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Phone Directory Company Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 969 at [3] per Gordon J: [3] The Court has power to refuse to grant leave to issue or to set aside a subpoena: O 27A and O 27 of the Federal Court Rules . It is well established that a subpoena must be issued for a legitimate forensic purpose: NSW Commissioner of Police v Tuxford [2002] NSWCA 139 at [20] . A subpoena will be refused unless the documents sought to be produced "on their face, have some potential relevance to the issues in dispute between the parties": Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2004] FCA 1137 at [29] . Subpoenas may be issued to non-parties provided that they specify with reasonable particularity the documents which are required to be produced: P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1044 ; [2007] FCA 1044 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [24] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCAFC 123">4 PDN obtained leave for the issue of a subpoena duces tecum to ASIC to produce documents connected with its investigation: P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Limited [2007] FCA 1044. Leave was opposed by Multiplex, but not by ASIC. Some thousands of documents were produced. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 969">13 However, the applicants submit that the form of the subpoena is, in this case, justified by the prior correspondence with the ACC. I accept this submission. The applicants are not asking the ACC to incur the costs of ransacking their records at cost. The 1 May 2008 letter from the ACC states that the records have already been searched. Similarly, the applicants are not asking the ACC to form a judgment about matters which the ACC is ignorant; the judgment has already been formed. Moreover, public investigatory bodies like the ACC which have previously conducted or are conducting an investigation and collected documents in the course of such investigation stand in a different position to a non-party such as a bank or business that simply happens to have acquired or generated potentially relevant documents in the ordinary course of business but has no special reason to know of any litigation or relevance of its records to that litigation. Such records as the ACC has can be, and usually are, clearly and separately identifiable and identified as documents obtained in the course of a particular investigation. P Dawson [2007] FCA 1044 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [25] .  12 Ordinarily, that sort of request contained in the catch-all would be set aside, given the well-settled rule that the court will not ask a stranger to the proceedings "to go to trouble and perhaps to expense in ransacking his records and endeavouring to form a judgment as to whether any of his papers throw light on a dispute which is to be litigated upon issues of which he is presumably ignorant. " P Dawson [2007] FCA 1044 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [24] . 3 The Court has power to refuse to grant leave to issue or to set aside a subpoena: O 27A and O 27 of the Federal Court Rules . It is well established that a subpoena must be issued for a legitimate forensic purpose: NSW Commissioner of Police v Tuxford [2002] NSWCA 139 at [20] . A subpoena will be refused unless the documents sought to be produced "on their face, have some potential relevance to the issues in dispute between the parties": Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2004] FCA 1137 at [29] . Subpoenas may be issued to non-parties provided that they specify with reasonable particularity the documents which are required to be produced: P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1044 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [24] .
  15 In addition, the submission that a court will not issue a subpoena as a substitute for discovery is not apposite. First, the authorities to that effect relate to the issue of subpoenas to a party to the litigation, not a non-party such as the ACC: P Dawson [2007] FCA 1044 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [24] . Secondly, "discovery" in this context is a term of art, as was explained by Heerey J in P Dawson [2007] FCA 1044 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [24] . It means only that a court will not ask a person to ransack their records without clear instructions as to what is being sought. Again, as I have explained, that is not the case here. The ACC has already identified the documents; the subpoena is simply a formality requested by the ACC as condition precedent to their handing over the documents. 15 In addition, the submission that a court will not issue a subpoena as a substitute for discovery is not apposite.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 783">74 Dr Bell pointed to [64] --- [66] of the judgment of Wilcox J in which his Honour referred to the evidence of Mr Johnsen, stating that it contained evidence of routine downloading of ARIA Top 50 and Top 100 recordings. Dr Bell referred me to the decision of Heerey J in Dawson Nominees v Multiplex [2007] FCA 1044 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [30] to support the proposition that access to the exhibits to the affidavits ought to be granted. But the observations of Heerey J in Dawson Nominees v Multiplex are not a charter for access to documents by non-parties. His Honour's remarks were made in the context of existing proceedings where the documents had potential relevance to the issues in the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 719">52 Sometimes a Notice to Produce may be an appropriate method of case management: see eg P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd [2007] FCA 1044 ; (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [30] per Heerey J. But that would usually be where the notice, or a subpoena, would be expected to produce documents that have at least potential relevance to the issues in the case: see P Dawson at [31].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCAFC 200">159 The Multiplex parties attacked this analysis by calling in aid the remarks of Heerey J in P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd [2007] FCA 1044. That was an interlocutory application in these proceedings which was heard and determined during the period that the primary judgment was reserved in the application under s 33N.  22 The passage from the reasons for judgment of Heerey J in P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd [2007] FCA 1044 at [32] was that "the case [would] proceed in this Court in one form or other, regardless of the outcome of the s 33N application; see s 33P of the Federal Court Act". Section 33P of the Act, to which Heerey J referred, provides for a Pt IVA proceeding to continue as an ordinary proceeding brought by the applicant for its benefit alone, once an application under s 33N has succeeded. His Honour's statement is not an indication that the proceeding would continue as a Pt IVA proceeding with a modified group definition.</sentence>
