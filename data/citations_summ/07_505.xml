<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 251">

7 A decision or purported decision to cancel a visa under the Migration Act is a privative clause decision or purported privative clause decision within the meaning of s 474(3)(b) Migration Act . In this case, it is clear that the decision of the Tribunal, which reviewed and affirmed the decision of the Minister's delegate to cancel the applicant's visa under the Migration Act , was also a privative clause decision or purported privative clause decision. Accordingly, an appeal to the Federal Court from a decision of the Tribunal concerning such a decision does not lie within s 44 AAT Act , and is not competent (cf Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 and Boyes v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 505). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1108">27 Counsel for the Minister also submitted that the Minister was under no duty to make inquiries about the interests of the children: see Boyes v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 505 at [54] . In the present case, the applicant had provided limited material about his children and it was open to the Minister to consider their circumstances having regard to the material which had been provided together with such other materials as the Department may have obtained.
