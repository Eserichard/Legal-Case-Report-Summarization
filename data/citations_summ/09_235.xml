<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 754">The steps referred to in para (c) of s 44(1) were (at the relevant time) provided for under Part 8 of the WR Act, as the provision implies. In the present case, to the extent that the provisions of s 44(1) were otherwise enlivened, the respondents made it clear that they did not contest the applicant's proposition that it was an agreement under Part 8 of the WR Act which they sought to have Civil Pacific and/or John Holland make. The respondents made that concession (as their submission effectively was) as a matter of fact, while pointing out that they did not accept the construction given to s 44(1)(c) in my interlocutory judgment in John Holland Pty Ltd v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2009] FCA 235 ; (2009) 174 FCR 526 , 538-540 [43]-[46]. For present purposes, I shall proceed by reference to the concession as so made.  In my interlocutory judgment given on 17 March 2009 in the John Holland proceeding [2009] FCA 235 ; (174 FCR 526) , I divided the respondents' conduct at the project head office, with which I am presently concerned, into three categories as follows (174 FCR at 540 [48]): 
 
 (i) Activities and behaviour which could readily be described as illegitimate, if not unlawful. In this category I would place such activities as urinating on, or conspicuously in the vicinity of, the project office, damaging the applicant's property, banging on windows, abusing the applicant's staff, impeding persons in the act of entering or leaving the project office, and the like. (ii) The display of union flags and paraphernalia and the peaceful presence of a multiplicity of persons who, by their numbers and demeanour, are not intimidating. Considered in isolation, I would not regard these kinds of activities as illegitimate, even arguably. Neither do I consider that there is any sense in which the applicant's choice is negated by them. (iii) Interference with the applicant's process of hiring staff for employment on the project.... 
 

 
In this proceeding, the applicant did not rely upon the third category as such, although he placed considerable emphasis upon the conduct of the protesters towards the WorkPac crew on 10 March 2009. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 371">There are two proceedings before the court today, in each of which there is a Notice of Motion for the extension of interim orders previously made. The applicants seek to widen the scope of the orders and to apply them to additional respondents. The present occasion is not one upon which I need to rehearse the background facts of the dispute which gives rise to each of these proceedings. Those facts have been sufficiently canvassed in previous interlocutory reasons which I have delivered: see Williams v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing Kindred Industries Union [2009] FCA 86 , Williams v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing Kindred Industries Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 103 , and John Holland Pty Ltd v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing Kindred Industries Union [2009] FCA 235. </sentence>
