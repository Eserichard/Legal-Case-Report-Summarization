<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1408">On behalf of Dr Wenkart it is now contended in his written submissions that the " facts which had been assumed at the time of the 2006 Full Court Proceedings were not those which came to be actually found by Branson J in 2008 ". In Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478 , Her Honour relevantly found as follows: 
 
 [88] As I have already mentioned, on 24 April 2002 (ie earlier than the filing of the cross-claim) Hunt &amp; Hunt formally requested that the costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris be taxed and Ms Sexton was appointed Taxing Officer on 6 August 2002. However, as at 31 October 2003 Ms Sexton had not completed her taxation. For the reasons given above, it seems to me that on 21 October 2003, if not before, Mr Pantzer effectively conceded that he had filed his cross-claim before the quantum of the amount of the costs to which he was legally entitled from Dr Wenkart in respect of the costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris had been determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 866">The amounts paid during bankruptcy, namely this amount of $430,744.30, may be traced in part to the judgment of Her Honour Justice Branson delivered on 11 April 2008: Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478 , 6 ABC(NS) 37. Her Honour there reviewed the resolutions which had been passed and a schedule prepared by Mr Pantzer and concluded: 
 
 [32] I conclude that on the proper construction of the above resolution, the creditors purportedly approved Mr Pantzer's remuneration as follows:
 (a) $ 60,744.70 for the period from 28 October --- 10 December 1999;
 (b) $ 80,000 for future remuneration from 13 December 1999;
 (c) $ 11,811.40 for the period from 11 March --- 28 March 2000;
 (d) $ 68,188.60 for future remuneration from 29 March 2000; and
 (e) $ 105,000.00 in accordance with para (a)(I) of the s 73 proposal. These amounts are reflected in the first eleven payment items shown on Mr Pantzer's schedule ... 
 

 
These sums total $325,744.70. Together with the sum of $105,000 paid to Cutler Hughes and Harris on 15 March 2002, the total is $430,744.70. Notwithstanding this discrepancy, reliance is placed upon the sum as claimed as set forth in the Certificate.  Given the conclusion of Branson J in Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478 , and the subsequent comments made in Wenkart v Pantzer [2009] FCA 1086 , it is simply said that no further claim for relief may now be advanced.  And, as at 31 October 2002, Branson J has concluded that Mr Pantzer was not then entitled to " orders in aid " of the order made on 11 March 2002: Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478 at [91] .  In the present proceeding, Her Honour Justice Branson clearly regarded the Notice of Motion as filed by Mr Pantzer on 31 October 2002 as " premature ". Given the construction of Orders 1 and 2 as made on 11 March 2002, and the subsequent certification of the date after which " 28 days had passed ", that conclusion of Her Honour was clearly correct. Her Honour was also very conscious of the " regrettably long and complex history of this matter ": [2008] FCA 478 at 92, 6 ABC(NS) 37 at 60.  Notwithstanding these conclusions of the Full Court, it is nevertheless now said on behalf of Dr Wenkart that: the decision of the Full Court preceded the judgment of Branson J on 11 April 2008 ( Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478) ; there is now " an extant finding that Mr Pantzer had no claim against Dr. Wenkart when he commenced these proceedings, which were always doomed to ultimate failure "; Mr Pantzer has acknowledged in a letter dated 13 March 2003 to the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia that " I was also initially advised by my solicitors that I ought to wait until taxation was completed before making application to the court to enforce the security pursuant to the consent orders "; and " these proceedings were premature, at all times at least until 10 January 2005 (when Mr Pantzer's 'lawful entitlements' --- consisting of remuneration and costs incurred in the conduct of these proceedings --- first exceeded funds received by him at which point only did he (arguably) have a claim capable of enforcement) ". The date of 10 January 2005, it is recalled, was that fixed by the Deputy District Registrar.  But the conclusion of Her Honour, with respect, says nothing as to either: the entitlement of Mr Pantzer to claim at some time in the future amounts for costs, expenses and remuneration; or the reasonableness of either filing the Notice of Motion on 31 October 2002 or his subsequent efforts to recover the amounts to which he claimed he has a lawful entitlement. 
Indeed, it was presumably the very ability of Mr Pantzer to make such claims that may have led Her Honour not to simply dismiss the " Cross-Claim " --- as was the order previously sought by Dr Wenkart: [2008] FCA 478 at [92] .  If any question as to the date upon which Mr Pantzer may have become " lawfully entitled " is presently left to one side, it is clear that the orders made by Beaumont J embraced: not only the amounts to which Mr Pantzer was lawfully entitled as at 11 March 2002 
but also 
 those amounts to which he " may become lawfully entitled " thereafter. That construction of the orders, it is considered:
 flows naturally from the terms of Order 1 itself; is not contrary to any conclusion previously expressed by any other Judge of this Court; and is supported by the construction given to the orders when the matter came before the Full Court in Pantzer v Wenkart [2006] FCAFC 140 at [44] , [2006] FCAFC 140 ; 153 FCR 466 at 477. So much was accepted by Senior Counsel on behalf of Dr Wenkart during the course of oral submissions. That concession was properly made. The question as to when Mr Pantzer became " lawfully entitled " was resolved by Branson J as being " an agreement to pay within 28 days of the determination of the quantum of 'the same' ": Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478 at [85] , 6 ABC(NS) 37 at 58 to 59.  Notwithstanding the order made by Branson J in September 2008 for such an inquiry to be conducted, and the conclusion expressed in the decision giving effect to the inquiry thereafter conducted, it must further be recalled that the September 2008 orders were preceded by Her Honour's decision in April 2008 wherein Her Honour: concluded that as at 31 October 2002 Mr Pantzer was not entitled to " orders in aid " of the 11 March 2002 consent orders made by Beaumont J; declined to dismiss the cross-claim, as Her Honour was then invited to do by Dr Wenkart as " Mr Pantzer could simply institute a fresh application seeking to enforce the charge over the Paddington property " ([2008] FCA 478 at [92]); and proposed the ordering of the inquiry " as a first step " in the " making of appropriate costs orders " to deal with the premature filing of the cross-claim. 
That was the purpose to be served by later ordering the inquiry to be held. It is also to be recalled that in her subsequent decision in September 2008, Branson J:
 expressed a belief that Dr Wenkart accepted that in determining the cross-claim filed by Mr Pantzer " the Court could take into account amounts ... after the date on which the cross-claim was filed " ([2008] FCA 1387 at [18]); and again adverted to her earlier disinclination to simply dismiss the cross-claim because such a course would be " likely to result in the institution of yet further litigation between the parties " and because this " did not seem ... to be in the public interest or in the interests of the parties, particularly having regard to the Court's wide powers to formulate orders for costs ".  But the difficulty then confronting Mr Pantzer in recovering the amount claimed of $193,531.18 is the fact that as at 31 October 2002 he was not then entitled to " orders in aid " of the order made on 11 March 2002. So much was the conclusion of Branson J in her April 2008 judgment: Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478 , 6 ABC(NS) 37. Her Honour there relevantly concluded: 
 
 Position as at 31 October 2002 
 

 
 
 [84] ... the significance of the date 31 October 2002 is that it is the date of the filing of Mr Pantzer's deemed cross-claim seeking "an order in aid of [the Court's] order made on 11 March 2002 by appointing Warren Pantzer as Trustee for Sale of the [Paddington property]" (see [2007] FCA 1589 at [17] ). 
 

 
 
 [85] ...[I]t is, I think, uncontroversial that Dr Wenkart's agreements to pay the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is "lawfully entitled" from him is an agreement to pay within 28 days of the determination of the quantum of "the same".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1086">As concluded by Branson J in her reasons for decision in April 2008 ( Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478): 
 
 [91] I conclude that as at the date that the cross-claim was filed, Mr Pantzer, in his capacity as trustee of Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate, had received a larger amount by way of receipts than the determined quantum of the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which he was lawfully entitled. Mr Pantzer has therefore failed to demonstrate that, as at the date of the filing of his cross-claim, he was entitled to "orders in aid" of the consent orders made on 11 March 2002. 
 

 
 
 [92] Nonetheless, I do not accept the submission of Dr Wenkart that it would be appropriate simply to dismiss the cross-claim with costs. This table, it is considered, correctly sets forth as the starting point the sum of $769,191.66. Reference had been made by Branson J to an alternative figure of $797,000: [2008] FCA 478 at [6] . But this alternative figure was apparently an error attributable to submissions by Senior Counsel previously appearing for Dr Wenkart. Nothing turns on this error, it being accepted by both Counsel that the correct sum is that identified in the Certificate . The sum of $769,191.66 was the sum identified by Her Honour when making the order that an " inquiry " be undertaken. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1387">As I noted in Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478 at [1] - [8], no agreement was reached between the parties as to the orders appropriate to be made to give effect to my reasons for judgment of 16 October 2007. Indeed, after hearing further from the parties, I accepted that I had not dealt with all outstanding issues between the parties. Those outstanding issues were dealt with in Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478. When publishing those reasons for judgment I stood the proceeding over to a date to be fixed for the purpose of the making of orders giving effect to the reasons, including orders as to costs. 3 Orders giving effect to my reasons for judgment have still not been made. These reasons for judgment should be read together with my earlier reasons for judgment. 2 The history and subject matter of this proceeding is summarised in Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589 at [2] - [35]. As I noted in Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478 at [1] - [8], no agreement was reached between the parties as to the orders appropriate to be made to give effect to my reasons for judgment of 16 October 2007. Indeed, after hearing further from the parties, I accepted that I had not dealt with all outstanding issues between the parties. Those outstanding issues were dealt with in Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478.</sentence>
