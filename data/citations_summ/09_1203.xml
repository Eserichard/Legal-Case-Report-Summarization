" ... a reference to the authorities makes it tolerably plain that the court will exercise its undoubted jurisdiction to set aside a subpoena in a variety of cases, as, for example: 
 unless the subpoena was issued for the purpose of a pending trial, hearing or application ... where to require the attendance of a witness would be oppressive ... where the subpoena had not been issued bona fide for the purpose of obtaining relevant evidence and the witness to whom the subpoena had been addressed was unable to give relevant evidence ... where the subpoena has been used for the purpose of obtaining discovery or further discovery against a party ... where the subpoena has been used for the purpose of obtaining discovery against a third party... where to require a party to comply with a subpoena to produce documents would be oppressive ... where the subpoena has been issued for a purpose which is impermissible, as, for example, "fishing" ...
