<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 803">Mr Abbott's primary submission was that since neither Commissioner Keelty, nor an eligible Commonwealth Board member chaired the Board meetings on 14 June 2007 and 25 June 2008, those meetings were not conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Act, specifically s 7E. It followed, so he submitted, that the resolutions of those meetings to make the third and fourth determinations, thereby extending the period of operation of the special investigation, were invalid and in breach of the Act. He submitted that since the Act conferred extensive coercive powers on the Commission and the Board, which intruded in a significant way on the liberty and privileges of individuals, the Act should be construed strictly in accordance with its terms. In making this submission, he relied heavily on the decision of Flick J in A B Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 (" AB ") at [19] to the effect that a provision of the Act: " ...must be construed according to its terms such that no greater power is in fact exercised than the words employed by the legislature permit ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 82">81 The primary judge considered the decision in A.B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 , where Flick J considered a number of factors which indicate whether the period of time allowed for production in a notice issued under s 29 is reasonable. His Honour also referred to the decision in Ganke v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1975) 25 FLR 98 .  85 There is no statutory requirement in the Act which requires that a notice under s29 specify a time for production, rather than require production "forthwith". The appellant gave authority to support a strict construction of s 29: AB Proprietary Limited v Australian Crime Commission &amp; Sage [2009] FCA 119 ; Australian Crime Commission v NTD8 [2009] FCAFC 86 ; C Incorporated v Australian Crime Commission [2010] FCAFC 4. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 553">In the same case, at [89], the Full Court said: We agree that the sufficiency of the Statement of Reasons was open to criticism. The appellant was correct to draw attention to what counsel described as the 'formulaic approach' of the reasons and to the importance of observing the requirements of s 29(1A). As Flick J observed in AB Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 ; (2009) 175 FCR 296 (AB) at [54] , an observation that was endorsed by this Court in NTD8 at [73], "[t]hose against whom the powers conferred by the 2002 Act are exercised are entitled to have confidence that the power is being lawfully invoked". In NTD8, as here, the Statement of Reasons, the Statement of Facts and Circumstances and the Legal Submissions in Support were formulaic and uninformative and did not focus attention on the specific considerations to which the Examiner had regard. Again they seem to bear the hallmarks of a standard form document (see the observations of this Court in NTD8 at [34]; Flick J in AB at [54] and Besanko J in GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759 at [51] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] VSC 101">37 Moreover, the requirement for production of "all books and records relating to the affairs of [the] Bill Express [Group], including..." is, in the circumstances of this case, sufficient specification. In this regard, whether the books required to be produced are sufficiently "specified" for the purposes of s 596D(2) is to be considered "against the background of the knowledge and circumstances of the [examinee] and the contextual facts". [66] It was submitted that there was not sufficient specification because the applicants have to make a judgment about whether documents relate to the "affairs" of the company. The fact that the examinee may have to make a judgment as to whether a document falls within the description does not make the summons oppressive. [67] The question is whether the summons makes "reasonably clear" what documents must be produced. [68]  [55] Ibid 569---570. [56] Cf Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 25 FCR 187. Eg of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) s 264 ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (1979) 143 CLR 499; Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) s 155 ; Pyne Board Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 57 FLR 368; Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) s 29 ; AB Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119. [57] [2009] FCA 119. [58] S 29 provides: 
 
 (1) An examiner may, by notice in writing served on a person, require the person: 
 (a) to attend, at a time and place specified in the notice, before the person specified by the notice, being an examiner or a member of the staff of the ACC; and 
 

(b) to produce at that time and place to the person so specified a document or things specified in the notice, being a document or thing that is relevant to a special ACC operation/investigation. 32 In AB Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [57] Flick J considered s 29 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) [58] which bears strong similarity to s 596D. Flick J said as follows: 
 
 
 The accepted public importance of the functions entrusted to the Commission can be no reason to construe the power conferred by s 29 in any manner other than that which the words and the context naturally bear. Nor is there any reason to construe the term "specify" in s 29 in the phrase "a document or thing specified in the notice" in any different manner to the manner in which the same term is used elsewhere in that section. But that is not the manner in which any of the notices have been construed in the decided cases. The more obscure a category of "document or thing" may be, the greater may be the imperative for that "document or thing" to be described with a degree of specificity or definiteness so that the person upon whom a statutory notice is given may be capable of identifying that "document or thing" and thereafter producing it. [59] 
 

His Honour concluded that:
 
 
 A document may be specified if the description of the document required to be produced is sufficiently certain to identify it to the person upon whom a notice is served --- even if that description may mean little (if anything) to a person without such knowledge. [60] 
 

Thus, in that context, the term "specified" was construed as requiring sufficient description to identify to the person upon whom the notice is served the documents that must be produced. The authorities on other statutory provisions conferring coercive power to require production of documents make it clear that the documents required to be produced must be identified with sufficient clarity. [60] 
 

Thus, in that context, the term "specified" was construed as requiring sufficient description to identify to the person upon whom the notice is served the documents that must be produced. The authorities on other statutory provisions conferring coercive power to require production of documents make it clear that the documents required to be produced must be identified with sufficient clarity. [61] This requirement is specifically expressed in s 596D in the prescription that the content of the notice must require production of "specified books" meeting the criteria in the two sub-paragraphs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCAFC 15">35 In Australian Crime Commission v NTD8 [2009] FCAFC 86 ; (2009) 177 FCR 263 at 270, the Full Court endorsed the following observation by Flick J in AB Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 ; (2009) 175 FCR 296 at 313:
 [T] he reasons as provided bear some of the hallmarks of a lack of attention being given by the examiner to the task being undertaken and some of the hallmarks of a standard form of reasons employed in such other instances upon which the examiner may have been called upon to exercise the power conferred by s 29. There is, for instance, not only the unacceptable brevity of the reasons provided but there is also a lack of attention as to whether the examiner was conducting a "special operation" or a "special investigation". The notices record that a "special operation" was being undertaken --- but the record of the reasons does not consider it appropriate to confine itself in a like manner. Those against whom the powers conferred by the 2002 Act are exercised are entitled to have confidence that the power is being lawfully invoked. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 105">And, upon an application seeking judicial review, the onus remains on an applicant to establish the excess of statutory power being alleged. An applicant " cannot make a bare assertion of impropriety and then fish for a case: he has the onus of establishing an improper exercise of power ": Australian Securities Commission v Lucas [1992] FCA 234 ; (1992) 36 FCR 165 at 177 per Drummond J. Thus, in VAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 117 at [45] Hill, Sundberg and Stone JJ regarded it as " trite law that the onus of establishing the factual foundation for a claim of a breach of natural justice or a failure to afford procedural fairness lies on the party alleging the breach... ". The onus also remains upon an applicant alleging any other excess or abuse of statutory power: Industrial Equity Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 46 at [22] to [23] [1990] HCA 46 ; , 170 CLR 649 at 671 to 672 per Gaudron J; X v Australian Crime Commission [2004] FCA 1475 at [22] , [2004] FCA 1475 ; 139 FCR 413 at 419 to 420 per Finn J. See also: AB Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 at [8] , [2009] FCA 119 ; 175 FCR 296 at 298. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCAFC 4">89 We agree that the sufficiency of the Statement of Reasons was open to criticism. The appellant was correct to draw attention to what counsel described as the 'formulae approach' of the reasons and to the importance of observing the requirements of s 29(1A). As Flick J observed in AB Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 ; (2009) 175 FCR 296 ( AB ) at [54], an observation that was endorsed by this Court in NTD8 at [73], "[t]hose against whom the powers conferred by the 2002 Act are exercised are entitled to have confidence that the power is being lawfully invoked". In NTD8 , as here, the Statement of Reasons, the Statement of Facts and Circumstances and the Legal Submissions in Support were formulaic and uninformative and did not focus attention on the specific considerations to which the Examiner had regard. Again they seem to bear the hallmarks of a standard form document (see the observations of this Court in NTD8 at [34]; Flick J in AB at [54] and Besanko J in GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759 at [51] ). However, deficiencies of this nature will not necessarily invalidate a notice: see, for example, AB at [59] per Flick J and SS v ACC [2009] FCA 580 at [97] per Jagot J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 1027">The ACC Act gives the examiner the power to fix the time for production and this is not a case in which an Act is silent on the time within which a statutory obligation must be performed. In other words, this is a not a case in which the law must imply a requirement that the performance of a statutory obligation must take place within a reasonable time because, under the ACC Act, the examiner has the power to fix the time for performance. However, as the decision in A. B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 illustrates, that does not mean that the examiner's decision as to the time within which documents or things must be produced is unexaminable. I do not need to examine in detail the grounds upon which an examiner's decision as to the time for production may be successfully challenged because I am satisfied that "forthwith" was a reasonable time in the circumstances of this case, or at least that the applicant has not established that an examiner could not reasonably take the view that it was a reasonable time.  The applicant referred to the decision in Ganke v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia (1975) 25 FLR 98 and submitted that the examiner was bound under the ACC Act to allow a reasonable time for the production of the documents and things and that the respondent bore the onus of establishing that "forthwith" was a reasonable time. After the hearing, the applicant wrote to my chambers and referred me to the decision of Flick J in A. B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119. In that case, his Honour referred to a number of factors which are to be considered in determining objectively whether the period of time allowed for production in a notice under s 29 is reasonable. He said (at [61]): 
 
 "The objective surrounding circumstances would include the breadth of each particular notice and (perhaps) the need for a recipient to construe the terms of a notice; the classes of documents required to be produced; the apparent ability of the recipient to collate and thereafter produce the documents; the time of the year at which a notice is served and intervening disruption to business activities by reason of public or religious holidays; whether there has been a prior attempt to require the production of the same or similar documents; and the time in fact allowed. Some consideration could also be given to the amount of time an examiner thought appropriate; although that consideration would not be decisive. " 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 759">The applicant submitted that, by reason of s 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act , the second respondent was required to set out in his reasons his findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based, and that he had not done that. It was not in this case contended by the respondents, as it had been by the respondents (albeit in the context of s 29 of the Act) in A B Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 ; (2009) 107 ALD 591 at 607 [54] per Flick J, that s 25D was engaged. I do not need to examine the question of whether the second respondent set out his findings or material questions of fact and referred to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based because, in my opinion, s 25D was not engaged and, even if it was, a failure to comply with its provisions would not lead to the conclusion that the second summons is invalid. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCAFC 86">34 On the appeal, NTD8 did not by notice of contention seek to uphold the decision at first instance on the basis that the Examiner had failed to comply with s 29(1A) by failing adequately to record reasons for his decision. It is apparent from the decision of Flick J in A.B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 ; (2009) 107 ALD 591 at [53] that the Examiner's reasons follow a template and we endorse his Honour's observations at [54] about their adequacy. We do not, however, have to resolve that issue. In this case, the Court has the benefit of the Statement of Facts and Circumstances and the Legal Submissions, which were not, apparently, made available for the purposes of the decision in A.B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 ; (2009) 107 ALD 591.  34 On the appeal, NTD8 did not by notice of contention seek to uphold the decision at first instance on the basis that the Examiner had failed to comply with s 29(1A) by failing adequately to record reasons for his decision. It is apparent from the decision of Flick J in A.B.

Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 ; (2009) 107 ALD 591.  63 The statutory power in s 29 of the ACC Act to obtain documents compulsorily is a provision which intrudes into the entitlement of any person to keep documents private and confidential. If exercised, the failure to comply with a notice carries significant consequences, including imprisonment for up to five years: s 29(3) and (3A). It should, therefore, be construed carefully according to its terms: see per French J (as he then was) in Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Ltd (1989) 20 FCR 403 at 433 and per Flick J in A.B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 ; (2009) 107 ALD 591 at [19] . 61 In A.B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 ; (2009) 107 ALD 591 , Flick J considered the validity of notices issued under s 29 of the ACC Act. The complaint concerned the lack of particularity in the notices, the time allowed for compliance with the notices, and the relevance of the documents specified. It was argued that relevance was a relevant consideration which the examiner ought to have taken into account, but had not done so. In the result, the attack on the validity of the notices on that ground failed, simply because his Honour was not persuaded that the examiner had not considered the relevance of the documents to be produced: see at [55] and [56]. In the course of his reasons, Flick J at [20] said:
 It is (perhaps) surprising that the legislature has thus seen fit to specify few express constraints upon the exercise of the power conferred by s 29. But such constraints as have been imposed include the requirement that the document or thing required to be produced is "a document or thing that is relevant to a special ACC operation/investigation"; that the "document or thing" required to be produced must be "specified in the notice"; and the requirements that an examiner must be "satisfied that it is reasonable in all the circumstances" to issue a notice and that "the reasons for the issue of the notice" be recorded in writing. Given the width of the power conferred, it is (perhaps) equally surprising that that which may be the subject of a notice also has the potential to lack certainty --- a "document" can be readily identified; but that which constitutes a "thing" will presumably be resolved over time. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FCA 580">SS submitted that paragraph 6 of the ATS determination did not record a finding by the Board that methods of collecting criminal information and intelligence not involving the use of powers in the ACC Act had not been effective; accordingly, it should be inferred that the Board did not comply with the requirements of s 7C(2). SS supported this submission by reference to the width of intrusive powers consequential upon a determination that an intelligence operation is a special operation (citing AB Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 at [54] - [58]). The width of those powers, said SS, meant that the Board was obliged to create a determination in writing which, on its face, disclosed the Board's careful consideration and finding that methods not using the powers under the ACC Act had not been effective. Paragraph 6 of the ATS determination, however, was nothing more than a "formulaic recitation" of the provisions of the ACC Act itself. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCA 312">Undoubtedly, where a large number of documents or extensive information is sought within a short period of time, and where an extension of time is not possible, the specification of a short period of time may reflect upon whether the power was exercised in good faith, for a collateral purpose or was unreasonable: see, eg, A. B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 at [65] per Flick J. In fact, it was alleged that the burden imposed on the applicants was of such a magnitude that no reasonable person exercising the power under s 155 would have made the decisions giving rise to the issue of certain of the Notices. Reliance was placed on the principles stated by Lord Greene MR in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223 and s 5(2)(g) of the ADJR Act. </sentence>
