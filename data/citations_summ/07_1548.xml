<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 530">Courts exercising the current jurisdiction have identified numerous factors that may be relevant in assessing the appropriate penalty: see, for example, Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 at 228-229 [120] - [123]; Comcare v Commonwealth [2009] FCA 700 ; (2009) 184 IR 441 at 461 [71] ; Comcare v John Holland Rail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 771 ; [2009] FCA 771 ; (2009) 188 IR 415 at 428-429 [136] - [142]; Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 ; (2007) 98 ALD 67 at 68-69 [5] - [7]; and Linfox at 168 [40]. Compare too DPP v Amcor Packaging Australia Pty Ltd [2005] VSCA 219 ; (2005) 11 VR 557 at 565 [35] . To quote Flick J in Post Logistics at 585-8 [32]-[39]: 
 
 [32] In the statutory context of the present legislation, Madgwick J has focussed attention upon those considerations relevant to the imposition of a penalty in Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 793">The view taken by Gyles J in Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 ; (2007) 98 ALD 67 was that the approach to be taken for the Court when parties have reached agreement as to the quantum of a pecuniary penalty was not so much a matter of the Court deciding what figure should be proposed. His Honour said (at [8]) 'a commonsense approach is to take the agreed figure and give consideration to whether it is within the range of appropriate figures ...' But the role of the Court is, by no means, one of mere rubber stamping. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 771">The maximum pecuniary penalty that might be imposed in this case is equivalent to $242,000.00. I note that in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 662 a penalty of $198,000.00 was imposed. In Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 , a pecuniary penalty of $20,000.00 was imposed. In Comcare v Postal Logistics Australasia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 1987 ; (2008) 178 IR 200 a pecuniary penalty of $165,000.00 was imposed. In Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 700 , a pecuniary penalty of $210,000.00 was imposed. Save in the National Gallery case, which was a minor matter on any view, the other three pecuniary penalties were imposed where the consequences of contravention were the death of an employee. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1987">33 In Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 , 98 ALD 67 a penalty of $20,000 had been agreed between the parties and ordered by the Court. Whilst not downplaying the serious risks involved, the injuries sustained by the workers were relatively mild. Gyles J there further observed:
 [8] All things considered, I am satisfied that the pecuniary penalty proposed is appropriate. As the cases indicate, it is not so much a question of me deciding what figure I would independently propose and then seeing whether it accords with the figure proposed. A commonsense approach is to take the agreed figure and give consideration to whether it is within the range of appropriate figures. In my opinion it is. I make the orders set out in the draft order which I have initialled and placed with the papers.  In answering that question, the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure. It will be appropriate if within the permissible range. In Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 at [4] , [2007] FCA 1548 ; 98 ALD 67 at 68 Gyles J referred to Mobil Oil and accepted that " that decision does provide appropriate guidance ". </sentence>
