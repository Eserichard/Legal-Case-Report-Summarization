<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 282">The weight of recent authority appears to be leaning towards the stricter (or narrower) construction to s 459S(2) , on which approach, for a ground to be 'material'; it is must be 'pivotal', 'crucial' or determinative of solvency ( Grant Thornton Services; Switz v Glowbind; HVAC Construction; Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1376 at [43] - [45]). 
  In Austin &amp; Black's Annotations to the Corporations Act , the learned authors summarise the varied approach to the construction of this section at [5.459S]: 
 
In New South Wales, the court will not grant leave to dispute a particular debt if the company contends it is solvent irrespective of whether that debt is due, so the status of that debt is not determinative of the company's solvency: Switz Pty Ltd v Glowbind Pty Ltd , above . A similar approach was taken by the Federal Court in HVAC Construction (Qld) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd , above ; Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1376 ; BC200608507 at [43]-[45] and Grant Thornton Services (NSW) Pty Ltd v St George Wholesale Distributors Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1777 ; BC200810536 at [19]-[22]. The contrary view was expressed in Bayview Holdings Pty Ltd (in liq) v Zan Holdings Pty Ltd BC9805541 and the difference in the authorities was noted in HVAC Construction (Qld) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd , above at [53]. Another approach is that a particular debt need not be determinative of the company's solvency, and materiality would be established if the company was undoubtedly insolvent if the debt was owed, and may be solvent if the debt was not owed: Radiancy (Sales) Pty Ltd v Bimat Pty Ltd (2007) 25 ACLC 1216 ; [2007] NSWSC 962 at [64] . In Hanson Construction Materials Pty Ltd v FEC Civil Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 161 at [20] , Barrett J noted, but did not need to resolve, the difference between these approaches. An application for leave under this section should ordinarily be determined before the hearing of the winding up application: Switz Pty Ltd v Glowbind Pty Ltd , above . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] NSWSC 113">In HVAC Construction (Qld) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1638 ; [2002] FCA 1638 ; (2002) 44 ACSR 169 , French J (as his Honour then was) (at [53]) went no further than did Spigelman CJ in Switz Pty Ltd v Glowbind Pty Ltd except to observe that s 459S(2) should be construed strictly to minimise the opportunity for delay by ensuring that the disputes about debts do not prolong the hearing of the issue of solvency. That observation is relevant to how the discretion under s 459S should be exercised if the conditions for its exercise are met, as well as to the construction of section s 459S(2). However, it does not warrant reading the words "material to" as meaning the same as "determinative of". Nor was the matter taken further in Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1376 at [43] - [46]. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 845">The primary judge also relied upon the authorities of HVAC Construction (Qld) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1638 ; (2002) 44 ACSR 169 at 184 and particularly at [53] (per French J) and Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1376 at [43] to [45] (per Besanko J). Having considered the reasons of the primary judge in relation to the construction and operation of s 459S of the Corporations Act , I am satisfied that there is no error reflected in his Honour's approach to the authorities and his Honour's approach to the construction and application of s 459S of the Corporations Act . </sentence>

 JUDGE WITHERS. By an originating process filed on 24 June 2008 the plaintiff sought an order that the defendant company be wound up for non-compliance with a statutory demand.  The Honourable Justice Besanko in the Federal Court of Australia in Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1376 cited with approval a decision of Weinberg J in Ace Contractors &amp; Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 728. In that matter Weinberg J said (excluding from the citation the authorities to which he referred): 
 
 The authorities which govern the operation of s 459G of the Corporations Law seem to me to establish the following propositions:
 * The respondent is presumed to be insolvent and as such bears the onus of proving its solvency: ...
 * In order to discharge that onus the Court should ordinarily be presented with the "fullest and best" evidence of the financial position of the respondent: ...
 * Unaudited accounts and unverified claims of ownership or valuation are not ordinarily probative of solvency. Nor are bald assertions of solvency arising from a general review of the accounts, even if made by qualified accountants who have detailed knowledge of how those accounts were prepared: ...
 * There is a distinction between solvency and a surplus of assets. A company may be at the same time insolvent and wealthy. The nature of a company's assets, and its ability to convert those assets into cash within a relatively short time, at least to the extent of meeting all its debts as and when they fall due, must be considered in determining solvency: ...
 * The adoption of a cash flow test for solvency does not mean that the extent of the company's assets is irrelevant to the inquiry. The credit resources available to the company must also be taken into account: ...
 *The question of solvency must be assessed at the date of the hearing. However, this does not mean that future events are to be ignored: ...
 * It is no abuse of process for an applicant to seek to wind up a company presumed to be insolvent by reason of its failure to comply with a statutory demand merely because that company contends that it is solvent, or because there may be alternative means available to the applicant to vindicate its rights: ...

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 257">

 In Equity Australia Corporation Pty Ltd v Falgat Constructions Pty Ltd (2005) 54 ACSR 813; [2005] NSWSC 918 per Macready JA and in Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb's Excavations Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 96 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 684 Barrett J referred to and accepted as useful the summary by Weinberg J in Ace Contractors above. Although the decision by Barrett J was overturned on appeal, the reasoning by Weinberg J was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb's Excavations Pty Ltd (No 2) (2003) 45 ACSR 711 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 1354 ; [2003] NSWCA 163 at [16] Meagher, Handley and Santow JJA. The principle that a respondent must adduce the "fullest and best" evidence of the financial position to rebut the presumption was recently considered and applied by Besanko J in Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1376. ASIC submits that Bowesco has failed to provide the " fullest and best " evidence of its financial position and failed to discharge the burden of proving solvency. Section 95A of the Act relevantly provides the test for solvency: 
 (1) A person is solvent if, and only if, the person is able to pay all the person's debts, as and when they become due and payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 129">The Full Court had there adopted a somewhat liberal approach to materiality. It seems to me that a fair reading of the reasons of the Chief Justice is that the proper approach to materiality is the narrow one. For completeness, it should be noted that in my opinion two justices of this Court have approached the matter on the more narrow view and have certainly thought themselves to be implementing the position in Switz: see HVAC Construction (Qld) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1638 ; (2002) 44 ACSR 169 at 184 [53] per French J; Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1376 at [43] - [45] per Besanko J. That would be sufficient for me to feel obliged to approach the matter on the same basis. Mr Davidson drew my attention to a decision of White J in Radiancy (Sales) Pty Ltd v Bimat Pty Ltd (2007) 25 ACLC 1216 where at 1226 [64] his Honour said this:
 
The question is not whether the debt demanded by Radiancy (Sales) is determinative of Bimat's insolvency.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1777">21 Secondly, the learned Chief Justice indicated at 671 [36] that he did not propose to follow the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in Bayview Holdings Pty Ltd (in liq) v Zan Holdings Pty Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of Western Australia, Ipp, Wallwork and Steytler JJ, 19 October 1998). The Full Court had there adopted a somewhat liberal approach to materiality. It seems to me that a fair reading of the reasons of the Chief Justice is that the proper approach to materiality is the narrow one. For completeness, it should be noted that in my opinion two justices of this Court have approached the matter on the more narrow view and have certainly thought themselves to be implementing the position in Switz: see HVAC Construction (Qld) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1638 ; (2002) 44 ACSR 169 at 184 [53] per French J; Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1376 at [43] - [45] per Besanko J. That would be sufficient for me to feel obliged to approach the matter on the same basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1936">2 Helimount Pty Limited (in Liquidation) (Helimount) was wound up in insolvency by order of the Court made on 26 July 2006. As that order was made by the Registrar, it was reviewable. The Registrar's decision was affirmed upon review by Besanko J: Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1376. Hugh Martin (the liquidator) is the liquidator of Helimount. The winding up order was made on the application of Web Wealth Proprietary Limited (Web Wealth), based on the failure of Helimount to pay a debt which was the subject of a statutory demand dated 28 November 2005. At that time, the sole director and sole shareholder of Helimount was Domenico Callipari. It is not necessary to refer to the matters raised by Helimount in opposition to the winding up order. They are not now relevant.</sentence>
