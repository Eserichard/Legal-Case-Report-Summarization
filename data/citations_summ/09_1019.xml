<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1251">Most recently, in Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoires Servier [2009] FCA 1019 ; (2009) 83 IPR 42 , Bennett J accepted the following as a convenient summary of some of the matters that had been considered relevant when questions of delay arose (83 IPR at 57 [88]): Mere delay does not warrant refusal although the patentee must explain any delay, which should be reasonable. If a patentee becomes aware of the undue breadth of its claims, it must act to amend them without undue delay. 
There is no support here for the categorical terms in which the applicants proposed that the matter of delay should be approached.  The applicants submitted that the court should not approach the exercise of its discretion under s 105 "in a manner hostile or antipathetic to any amendment", relying in this respect upon the judgment of Sundberg J in Wimmera Industrial Minerals Pty Ltd v RGC Mineral Sands Ltd (No 3) [1997] AIPC 91-366 , and upon that of Bennett J in Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoires Servier (No 2) [2009] FCA 1019 ; (2009) 83 IPR 42 , 57 [88]. That was accepted by the respondents, and I shall act in accordance with it. Indeed, I would go further and observe that s 105 appears to have a beneficial purpose and that, generally speaking, the approach of the court should be such as will achieve that purpose. This is, of course, to go no further than to agree with the second principle to which Aldous J referred in Smith Kline , namely, that amendments will be allowed provided that they are permitted under the Act, and that no circumstances arise which would lead the court to refuse them: see ICI Chemicals and Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corp [1999] FCA 1417 at [37]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 131">77 The primary judge summarized these guidelines at [87] of her reasons: see Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoires Servier (No 2) [2009] FCA 1019 ; 83 IPR 42 at 57. Citing Bodkin, Patent Law in Australia (Lawbook Co, 2008) at [13510], the primary judge listed the following matters as relevant to the exercise of discretion under s 105: 
 &#8226; whether there has been a full disclosure of all relevant matters; 
 
 &#8226; whether the patentee has sought to obtain an unfair advantage from the unamended patent; 
 
&#8226; whether there has been any unreasonable delay in seeking amendment; and 
 
 &#8226; whether any circumstances arise that would lead the Court to refuse the amendment. 
 

Her Honour continued (83 IPR at 57 [88]):
 The court does not approach the exercise of its discretion in a manner hostile or antipathetic to amendment. However, the onus is on the patentee to satisfy the court that the amendments should be allowed. The court is concerned with the conduct of the patentee and not with the merit of the invention: Smith Kline at 569. Bodkin, 2008, at [13520] and following conveniently summarises some of the matters that have been considered relevant. They include: 
 
 &#8226; Mere delay does not warrant refusal although the patentee must explain any delay, which should be reasonable. &#8226; If a patentee becomes aware of the undue breadth of its claims, it must act to amend them without undue delay. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1169">The respondents also point to the decision of Bennett J in Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoires Servier Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 1019 ; (2009) 83 IPR 42 where, at [37]-[38], her Honour applied Lockwood and noted that coincidence of language between a claim and a consistory clause is insufficient on its own to provide fair basis if that is inconsistent with the description of the invention when considering the specification as a whole. I adopt her Honour's observations in this regard. It is clear from the authorities that the mere insertion of a consistory clause or clauses into the body of a specification is insufficient to show that the claims in a patent are fairly based on the specification. More is required. The claims must be consistent with the description of the invention disclosed in the specification when read as a whole. With this in mind I now turn to consider the two ways in which the respondents say that the claims in the Patent are not fairly based on the specification. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 983">These provisions have been considered in recent applications made to the Court by patentees to amend their patent specifications in the course of proceedings: see eg. Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoires Servier (No.2) [2009] FCA 1019 ; [2009] FCA 1019 ; (2009) 83 IPR 42 ( Apotex (No. 2) ); Zetco Pty Ltd v Austworld Commodities Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 235 ; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company v Apotex Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 814. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 814">Apotex does not oppose the making of the amendments. Although non-compliance with s 40(3) is a bar to amendment being allowed, the non-compliance must arise "as a result of the amendment": see s 102(2) of the Act, quoted below. Apotex submits that the aspects of alleged non-compliance on which it relies for the purposes of its cross-claim for revocation are pre-existing defects in the claims and, as such, are not defects that would result from any amendment which Otsuka now seeks. In Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoires Servier (No 2) [2009] FCA 1019 ; (2009) 83 IPR 42 at [28] Bennett J recognised that there may be deficiencies in an existing complete specification or lack of compliance with s 40 which do not fall for consideration at the time of an application for amendment. Be that as it may, Otsuka has stated that it accepts that, by not opposing the amendments as sought, Apotex is not and will not be precluded from relying in the principal proceeding on those parts of its currently filed particulars of invalidity that relate to non-compliance with s 40(3) of the Act should the proposed amendments be allowed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 671">Dealing first with issue waiver, it was common ground that the timing and content of the applicants' knowledge (or of facts from which the applicants ought to have had knowledge) of the need to amend the patent in suit is an issue which arises in the s 105 application. Furthermore, it seems to be an issue which the applicants themselves have no choice but to bring to the table, as it were. It seems to be accepted that the application will be required to be determined by reference to the principles adumbrated by Aldous J in Smith Kline , one of which was that the application should be rejected if the applicants knew, or should have known, that the patent should be amended at a time when they seek to obtain unfair advantage from it, and another of which was that the onus lies upon the applicants, and that they must make full disclosure of all relevant matters. I accept that these principles, as Aldous J described them, are not principles in the sense of being "fixed rules to be applied inexorably to every case" ( Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoire Servier (No 2) [2009] FCA 1019 ; (2009) 83 IPR 42 , 57 [86]), but on any view they are principles in the sense of being relevant considerations to which the court, if required by the respondents, must pay due regard. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 235">Some of the principles relevant to amendment were discussed in Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoires Servier (No 2) [2009] FCA 1019 ; (2009) 83 IPR 42 at [29] ---[37]. Relevantly, and in summary, the amendments need to be examined to determine: whether, by reason of the amendments, the proposed specification read as a whole claims matter not in substance disclosed in the specification (including the claims) as filed (s 102(1)) ; whether the proposed claim in substance falls within the claims before amendment (s 102(2)(a)). That is, if the amended claims are of broader scope than the claims before amendment, the amendments are not allowable; whether as a result of the amendment, the specification as a whole would not comply with s 40(2) or (3) of the Act (s 102(2)(b)). A specification as amended fails to comply with s 40(3) for lack of fair basis if any claim as proposed to be amended "travels beyond" the specification as amended. The amendments to the claims: s 102(1) and 102 (2)(a)

 This is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of a single judge of this Court made on 11 September 2009 ( Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoires Servier (No 2) [2009] FCA 1019).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 1069">I found the proposed amendments allowable under s 102 of the Patents Act 1990 ('the Act') but, in the exercise of the discretion afforded by s 105 of the Act, declined to allow the amendments ( Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoires Servier (No 2) [2009] FCA 1019).</sentence>
