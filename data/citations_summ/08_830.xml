<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1025">In Thoo v Kelly [2008] FCA 830 ; (2008) 169 FCR 470 , Lindgren J considered and rejected a contention that the authority of a committee to investigate services 'was limited to ... the concern that had moved the Director to act' [26]. His Honour held that ss 106H(l) and (3) 'provide a complete answer to this contention', and observed at [28] in relation to s l06H(3): 
 
 'Subsection (3), although not itself a "source" of power, had the effect that the Committee's investigation of the referred services identified above was not to be limited by the reasons given by the Director or anything else in the Director's report (or the reasons given in the HIC's request or anything else in the HIC's request). '

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 303">That passage from JL Holdings does not state and should not be taken as stating some general or universal proposition that a party is entitled to an adjournment so long as the opposing party is looked after by an award of costs. As many decisions since JL Holdings have stated, the "attainment of justice" is a goal that is not achieved without a proper consideration of the facts in any given case : Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1623 , [2]; Cassar v Hans Pet Constructions Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 1386 , [18]-[24]; Chameleon Mining NL v Murchison Metals Ltd [2009] FCA 137 , [9]-[15]; Finerty v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1136 , [29]---[31]; Smolle v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2008] FCA 1065 , [68]; Williams v Calivil Park Holsteins Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 31 , [20]-[21]. The basic premise was clearly enunciated by Lindgren J at [52] in Thoo v Kelly [2008] FCA 830 ; (2008) 169 FCR 470: 
The refusal of an adjournment may amount to a denial of procedural fairness if it is likely to deny a party a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [40] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ ( Bhardwaj ); Touma v Saparas [2000] NSWCA 11 at [27] ). The procedure that will satisfy the demands of procedural fairness may differ in order "to meet the particular exigencies of the case" ( Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 615 per Brennan J). As I stated in Ali v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1415 ; (2005) 41 AAR 410 at [27] :
 
 
Ultimately, each complaint of a failure to accord procedural fairness by reason of the refusal of an adjournment turns on its own facts. Whether an adjournment should be granted is a matter within the discretion of the trial Judge (or Tribunal), to be resolved according to the overall requirements of justice in the particular circumstances [citation omitted]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] NSWSC 1061">84 In Thoo v Professional Services Committee No 446 (2008) 103 ALD 277 ; [2008] FCA 830 , Lindgren J recently reviewed the authorities relating to the question as to whether the refusal of an adjournment constituted denial of procedural fairness. His Honour there stated:-
 

 
 
 
 "52. The refusal of an adjournment may amount to a denial of procedural fairness if it is likely to deny a party a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwha (2002) 209 CLR 597 ; [2002] HCA 11 at [40] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ; Touma v Saparas [2000] NSWCA 11 at [27] . The procedure that will satisfy the demands of procedural fairness may differ in order 'to meet the particular exigencies of the case': Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 615; [1985] HCA 81 ; 62 ALR 321 at 369-370 per Brennan J. As I stated in Ali v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 41 AAR 410 ; [2005] FCA 1415 at [27] :- 
 
 


 
 '27. Ultimately, each complaint of a failure to accord procedural fairness by reason of the refusal of an adjournment turns on its own facts.
