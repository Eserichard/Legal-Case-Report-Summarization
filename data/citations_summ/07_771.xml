Unlike in Singh's case, and the law which applied at that time, the Tribunal does not need to deliver its decision in order for its review to be complete; s.368A(3) makes this clear. Once the Tribunal's review is complete and it is functus officio as the Tribunal's file note reproduced at CB 82 reveals it was by the time Mr Stanton's letter arrived, it has no power to reopen its review or to consider further information which might, if supplied earlier, have been relevant to that review. </sentence>

 It would be inconsistent with that scheme and contrary to the ordinary reading of Div 2 of Pt 7 of the Act to treat the decision of the Tribunal as provisional in nature. In the situation where the Tribunal had, without reviewable error, disposed of an application for review of the decision of the delegate made on 11 October 1995, the Act did not confer upon the Tribunal any authority subsequently to reconsider the decision of the delegate by reason of later changed circumstances.

<sentence id="cs33" from="[2008] FMCA 321">In the alternative I am satisfied that the application should be dismissed under r.13.10(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules on the basis that the applicant had no reasonable prospect of success, having regard to the fact that the Tribunal was undoubtedly correct in finding that it had no jurisdiction to determine the application as it was functus officio by reason of its decision handed down on 28 February 2001. I note again that even if circumstances in the applicant's country had changed (although there is nothing to indicate that the applicant raised such a claim with the Tribunal on the last occasion) the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to review a decision of a delegate again on that basis, albeit that such a change may provide a basis for the Minister to permit a further application under s.48B of the Act (see SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs34" from="[2008] FMCA 343">First, it is clear that the Tribunal's conclusion that as there had been a prior review of the delegate's decision it no longer had jurisdiction to review that decision because it had discharged its functions under the Migration Act to carry out such a review was correct (see Shantha Karunaratna Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs &amp; Anor [1997] FCA 551 and SZASP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 at [4] and cases cited therein).  I am satisfied that it has been established that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting this proceeding and hence, that his application should be dismissed pursuant to r.3.10(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules. Thus it is not necessary for the Court to determine whether the proceedings are also an abuse of process (see SZASP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 771). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs35" from="[2008] FMCA 344">I also agree with Ms Palmer's submissions that the litigation history of this applicant and the unmeritorious nature of the application to the Tribunal and subsequently to this Court are factors which demonstrate that this application is an abuse of process: SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 per Moore J at [22]-[23] where His Honour stated: [22] The applications in each of the matters must be dismissed. Were leave granted, none of the appeals would have any prospect of success. Each is also an abuse of the process of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs36" from="[2008] FCA 432">14 The application for leave to appeal to this court is a part of a second round of reviews, if I can describe it in that way, of the delegate's decision. The crux of the Federal Magistrate's decision on this aspect is contained in paragraphs [15] and [16] of her reasons for decision. She earlier points to the decision of this court in SZASP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 where Justice Moore makes various observations about applications that involve an abuse of process of the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs37" from="[2008] FCA 286">27 As observed above, Barnes FM concluded that the RRT was correct in its decision that it no longer had jurisdiction to review the delegate's decision because it had previously conducted a proper review of that decision: see [9] and [10] of her Honour's decision. In reaching that conclusion, her Honour relied upon the decisions of this Court in Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 551 ; (1997) 76 FCR 301 at 311 and SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 and the decisions referred to therein. I have read those decisions and I have also read the decision of SZDMO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 989 at [6] which is to similar effect. I respectfully agree with her Honour's reasoning and the conclusion she reached that having previously conducted a proper review of the delegate's decision the RRT no longer had jurisdiction to conduct a further review. </sentence>

So much is made clear by the decisions of the High Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Thiyagarajah [2000] HCA 9 ; (2000) 199 CLR 343 and the decision of Goldberg J in Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 551 ; (1997) 76 FCR 301.

<sentence id="cs47" from="[2007] FCA 1759">9 The background to the application before me can be seen from the reasons for decision of Smith FM given 14 August 2007. As these reasons are brief, it is feasible to set them out in their entirety:
 
 
 "1. This is an application which reveals the abusive characteristics identified by Justice Moore in SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771. The applicant has brought a second application to the Refugee Review Tribunal, after his first application to the Tribunal for review of a decision of a delegate was affirmed by a previous Tribunal decision. The validity of the earlier decision was upheld in the course of extensive judicial review litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs48" from="[2007] FCA 1758">13 In this case it is clear that, so far as concerns the first applicant, her claims for review of the decision of the Tribunal, and her grounds for such claims have already been the subject of earlier decision by the Federal Court, and are res judicata . Further, it is clear that an attempt to re-litigate matters already determined is an abuse of process and should not be entertained by the Court. In Reichel v Magrath (1889) 14 App Cas 665 at 668-669, Lord Halsbury LC said that it would be: 
 
 "...a scandal to the administration of justice if, the same question having been disposed of by one case, the litigant were to be permitted by changing the form of the proceeding to set up the same case again. ...it surely must be in the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to prevent the defeated litigant raising the very same question which the Court has decided in a separate action. "
 

(see also Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police [1981] UKHL 13 ; [1982] AC 529 ; [1981] 3 All ER 727 ; Haines v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1995] NSWSC 136 ; (1995) 43 NSWLR 404 ; Rippon v Chilcotin Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 142 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 198 , the Full Court in Wilson v Commonwealth of Australia [1999] FCA 1308 at [11] - [12]; Lidden and Anor v Composite Buyers Ltd &amp; Ors (1996) 139 ALR 549 ; and Thirteenth Corp Pty Ltd v State [2006] FCA 979 ; (2006) 232 ALR 491 at 500). Indeed, the patent abuse of process this case bears similar characteristics to cases dismissed by Moore J in SZASP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 , and I note as equally applicable to this case comments of his Honour at [1], [22] and [23].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs49" from="[2007] FMCA 1878">Section 416 would not assist the applicant in the circumstances of this case. As Moore J stated in SZASP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 , in circumstances where a Tribunal had found that it had no jurisdiction to review the decision of a delegate which had already been the subject of an earlier Tribunal decision, " s.416 cannot apply in such circumstances" (at [17]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs50" from="[2007] FMCA 1849">It is clear that the Tribunal conclusion that as there had been a prior review of the delegate's decision in issue, it no longer had jurisdiction to review that decision because it had discharged its functions under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) to carry out such a review was correct (see Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 551 ; (1997) 76 FCR 301 and SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2007) FCA 771 at 4 and cases cited therein). Insofar as it may be intended to suggest in the application for review of the Tribunal decision that the Tribunal was under some obligation to invite the applicant to a hearing or otherwise investigate his claims to be a refugee, the issue for the Tribunal that was determinative was whether it had jurisdiction. The Act does not oblige the Tribunal to invite an applicant to a hearing in relation to the preliminary issue of whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction.  In these circumstances it is not necessary for the Court to determine whether the proceedings are also an abuse of process or, indeed, whether they are frivolous and vexatious. In that respect I note first, however, that in this case, in contrast to some other cases involving an application for review of a second Tribunal decision, the applicant does not have such an extensive prior history of litigation in relation to the first Tribunal decision as was considered by Moore J in SZASP v Minster for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 771. His involvement in the Lie class action did not prevent the applicant's subsequent initiation of individual proceedings seeking review of the first Tribunal decision in this Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs51" from="[2007] FMCA 1827">on 27 July 2007 these proceedings were commenced by the filing of the application already referred to. The basis of the Tribunal's decision signed on 3 July 2007 was that it had no jurisdiction to review the delegate's decision of the sittings of 21 November 2002. In reaching that conclusion the Tribunal made reference to the fact that it had already, in a differently constituted form, affirmed the delegate's decision on 14 October 2003 and then set out the progress of the applicant's judicial review application and subsequent appeal. In relation to the Tribunal's conclusion that it was functus officio , it is important to keep in mind that the delegate's decision was dated 21 November 2002 and the Tribunal gave its original decision on 14 October 2003. There has been no new decision of the delegate. The Tribunal was correct to conclude that once it has undertaken a review of a delegate's decision the Tribunal does not have power to conduct a second review of it: Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 551 ; (1997) 76 FCR 301 ; Singh v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 73 ; (2001) 109 FCR 18. As Moore J said in SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (2007) FCA 771 at [4]: It is necessary to first say something about the applicant's attempt to seek a second review of the delegate's decision in the Tribunal. The Tribunal's conclusion it no longer had jurisdiction to review the delegate's decision, as it had already discharged its functions under the Act to review the delegate's decision, is correct. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs52" from="[2007] FMCA 1663">6. In this case the applicant's application is certain to fail because the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to consider for a second time the applicant's application for review of the delegate's decision. So much is made clear by the decision of Goldberg J in Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 551 ; (1997) 76 FCR 301 and also by the decision of Moore J in SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs53" from="[2007] FMCA 1661">
 
 3. In this case it is clear that the applicant's application is certain to fail because the Tribunal was correct to conclude that it did not have jurisdiction to conduct a second review of the delegate's decision. That is clear from the decision of Goldberg J in Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 551 ; (1997) 76 FCR 301 and the decision of Moore J in SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs54" from="[2007] FMCA 1552">10. It is clear that the Tribunal conclusion that as there had been a prior review of the delegate's decision it no longer had jurisdiction to review that decision because it had discharged its functions under the Migration Act to carry out such a review was correct. (See Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 551 ; (1997) 76 FCR 301 and SZASP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 at [4] and cases cited therein. ) The applicant's claim about his failure to appear at the first hearing does not change the correctness of the Tribunal's conclusion in relation to the prior Tribunal review. The Tribunal in this instance was not under an obligation to invite the applicant to a tribunal hearing in relation to his second and invalid application. The Migration Act does not oblige the tribunal to invite an applicant to a hearing in relation to the preliminary issue of whether the tribunal has jurisdiction. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs55" from="[2007] FMCA 1424">[1] The Tribunal found that a full review of the delegate's decision had been undertaken, and that the Tribunal had already discharged its functions. [2] The Tribunal also noted that the applicant had already unsuccessfully sought judicial review of the first Tribunal decision. [3] 
 The Tribunal's conclusion that it had no jurisdiction to review the application was plainly correct [4] and the Tribunal was functus officio . [5] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs56" from="[2007] FMCA 1458">13. Moreover, there is authority that where an applicant seeks a second review of a delegate's decision, the Tribunal no longer has jurisdiction to review the delegate's decision, as it has already discharged its functions under the Migration Act to review that decision (see Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 551 ; (1997) 76 FCR 301). Hence a decision to that effect (as in this case) is a correct decision in which no jurisdictional error is apparent. (See in particular SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 at [4] and cases cited therein. ) There is nothing in the material before me to establish that there is, either on the basis of the grounds set out in the application of 24 July 2007 or otherwise, a prima facie ground for the proceeding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs57" from="[2007] FMCA 1476">7. The question is whether the Tribunal's decision is affected by jurisdictional error and whether it should be set aside. In my view, the Tribunal did not err. It was correct in concluding that it was functus officio and that it did not have power to conduct a second review of the delegate's decision. So much is made clear by the decisions of Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 551 ; (1997) 76 FCR 301 ; Singh v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 73 ; (2001) 109 FCR 18 ; in SZEBS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 456 ; and SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs58" from="[2007] FMCA 1392">8. Once the Tribunal makes a decision on an application for review of a decision of the Minister's delegate not to grant a protection visa, the Tribunal has no power to hear a further application for a review of that decision. Such is made clear by authorities such as Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 551 ; (1997) 76 FCR 301 ; Singh v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 73 ; (2001) 109 FCR 18 ; SZEBS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 456 ; and SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs59" from="[2007] FMCA 1457">This is an application which reveals the abusive characteristics identified by Justice Moore in SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs60" from="[2007] FMCA 1368">7. The applicant told me that he was unsatisfied with previous legal advice he had received which involved a strategy of filing multiple judicial review applications against the first Tribunal decision, none of which proceeded to a final hearing before that dealt with by Turner FM. If the applicant was following advice he was very poorly advised to return to the Tribunal for a second attempt to have the Tribunal review the decision of the delegate. The Tribunal's conclusion that it had no jurisdiction to review the application was plainly correct [4] and the Tribunal was functus officio . [5] That message should now have reached individuals advising applicants in circumstances like the present. However, the Court continues to see applications coming before it where applicants have returned to the Tribunal for a second attempt at review on the merits of a delegate's decision. The fact that this course is continuing to be adopted despite repeated decisions by the Courts that it is pointless suggests that it is a device to achieve objectives other than review on the merits. It is a matter meriting consideration by the Government and the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs61" from="[2007] FMCA 1403">The applicant then followed a path of lodging a plainly hopeless application to the Tribunal in circumstances very familiar to this Court, and which have been characterised as abusive by Moore J in SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs62" from="[2007] FMCA 1327">The present application, therefore, fits clearly within a pattern detected by Moore J in SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 , in which he urged the Minister to halt a plainly abusive practice which is occupying substantial resources of the Australian Federal courts, and risks bringing their processes into disrepute.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs63" from="[2007] FMCA 1318">Moore J has recently characterised such proceedings as plainly abusive (see SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs64" from="[2007] FMCA 1385">15. First, it is clear that the Tribunal's conclusion that there had been a prior review of the delegate's decision and that it no longer had jurisdiction to review the delegate's decision as it had already discharged its functions under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) to carry out such a review was correct (see Jayasinghe v MIEA [1997] FCA 551 ; (1997) 76 FCR 301 and SZASP v MIAC [2007] FCA 771 at [4] and cases cited therein). Moreover, as Moore J held in SZASP at [4] the Tribunal in that case (and also in this case) was correct in finding that: 
 
 
 ... changed circumstances did not provide any legal basis for undertaking a second review. The avenue provided by the Act to take into account changed circumstances, at least potentially, is the Minister's power to permit lodgement of a further protection visa application under s48B of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs65" from="[2007] FMCA 1176">[3] The Tribunal was functus officio and its decision is free from error.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs66" from="[2007] FMCA 1188">Having regard to the litigation history of the Applicant in commencing this proceeding and in the light of the litigation history between the parties in relation to judicial review of the Refugee Review Tribunal's decision handed down on 28 March 2002, in my view it is an abuse of the Court's process for the Applicant to have commenced the proceeding and allowing the continuation of such a proceeding is likely to bring the Court into disrepute ( SZASP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 771).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs67" from="[2007] FMCA 898">I have also been taken to the decision of Moore J in SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 771 where his Honour said at [4]:
