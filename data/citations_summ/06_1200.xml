<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 269">14 Although the thrust of authority to which I have referred places the burden of proof squarely upon the party asserting that the privilege has been lost pursuant to s 122(2) of the Evidence Act , it is to be noted that a different approach appears to have been taken by Sundberg J in Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [6] where his Honour noted: 
 
 
 Where a document which is privileged, or alleged to be privileged, in the hands of the client for whom it was prepared, is then provided to a third party, the party claiming privilege bears the burden of proving that the provision of that document to the third party did not waive privilege. That burden will be discharged by showing that the circumstances of the provision of the document to the third party were not such as to constitute "inconsistency between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality which effects a waiver of the privilege. 
 

His Honour then referred to Mann v Carnell , [7] being the judgment of Gleeson CJ, and Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ. However, with respect to the observation of Sundberg J, the High Court, did not here analyse the burden of proof. His Honour cites no authority for the position that where the document in question passes to a third party the burden of proof shifts to the claimant of the privilege under s 122 or at common law. For these reasons I decline to follow Sundberg J's approach in Rio Tinto but prefer the approach taken in the cases referred to by Rein AJ in Sharjade Pty Ltd v RAAF Landings to which I have already referred.</sentence>
