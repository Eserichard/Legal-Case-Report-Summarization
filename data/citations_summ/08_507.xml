 In my view, the decision in Zhong is distinguishable on the facts since it was concerned with non-compliance and the relevant section of the Act in that case required the Minister to have first decided that the holder of the visa had not complied with specific provisions of the Act before giving the holder of the visa a notice. While s 134(4) is subject to s 134(5) and to s 135, s 134(4) is purely about cancelling visas by giving written notice of cancellation to the visa holders, and does not itself deal with the grounds for cancellation.

 In my opinion, s 107 is only engaged where the Minister, or relevantly a delegate of the Minister, has concluded that the holder of a visa has not complied with one of the sections or subsection mentioned in s 107(1). It is only in that case that the Minister or the delegate is entitled to give notice to the visa holder in accordance with that subsection. Section 107(1) is engaged because the Minister, or a delegate of the Minister, has reached a state of mind where they consider that the holder of a visa has not complied with a relevant section. The Tribunal has to decide whether, in this case, the delegate had reached a state of mind where he considered that the holder of the visa had not complied with a relevant section. The delegate must have reached a state of mind whereby the delegate considered that one or more of the sections or the subsection mentioned in s.107(1) has not been complied with. Did the delegate consider that there had actually been non-compliance before issuing the s.107 Notice? Lander J.

On 31 July 2008, following the decision in Zhong v MIAC [2008] FCA 507 , the delegate issued the applicant with a further NOICC. The NOICC refers to the applicant's answer on the application form that he had not been married before and also his declaration that the information he provided on the application was complete, correct and up to date in every detail. The delegate noted that DIAC staff conducted inquiries which indicated that he married Ms Iranzo on 27 October 1997 and that there was no record of divorce or annulment of the marriage, so that he remained legally married to Ms Iranzo. With respect to s. 97 of the Act, the delegate noted that the applicant presented a bogus document in the form of a certificate from the National Statistics Office in Manila. This was said to be a bogus document as per s. 97 of the Act because it contained incorrect information that there was no record of his marriage in the Philippines. The delegate also noted that the applicant had not complied with s. 105(1)(a) of the Act because he failed to notify DIAC that he provided incorrect answer on his migration application. The delegate also invited the applicant to provide information with respect to the discretionary considerations.  The first NOICC was issued to the applicant in April 2008.

The Tribunal is of the view, having regard to the language of the second NOICC issued on 31 July 2008, that the delegate had not merely considered that the applicant may have breached certain provisions of the Act, but had reached the requisite state of mind to engage s.107.
