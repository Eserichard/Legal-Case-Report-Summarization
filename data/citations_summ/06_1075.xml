<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] FCA 1461">The applicant appealed to the Federal Magistrates Court. At the hearing on 21 March 2006, the applicant was expressly put on notice that his application could be dismissed if the Court was not satisfied that it raised an arguable case for the relief claimed ( MZXGP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1075 per Black CJ at [14]). He was given an opportunity to obtain legal advice under the Court's panel advice scheme and to amend his application. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1425">21 
 
At one point the applicant father complained of not having had sufficient time to have presented such evidence as he wished to present on the appeal. When it was pointed out to him that his notice of appeal of 5 May 2006 anticipated such further material and that a significant time had elapsed since then, he did not develop that point. He did, however, repeat the claim that the applicants did not have sufficient time to prepare submissions or other material for the hearing before the learned Federal Magistrate. Unlike the circumstances addressed by Black CJ in MZXGP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1075 , the applicants were notified by the Federal Magistrate that a hearing would take place to determine whether there was any arguable merit in his application. They were informed that the material then before the Court may be inadequate to support the existence of an arguable case. They were given 18 days within which to file such further evidence or particularity as they were advised. They only filed further submissions which, as observed above, the Federal Magistrate described as formulaic. </sentence>
