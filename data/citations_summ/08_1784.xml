<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 740">In more recent times, the importance to be attached to the merits of the substantive proceedings has been downgraded somewhat as a criterion to be taken into account: see Hua-Aus Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 743 at [12] per Edmonds J. In Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2008] FCA 1784 (" Culley "), Jessup J held (at [5]) that: 
 
 ... the court should be slow to reject an application for an extension of time under s 44(2A) of the AAT Act, ..., for no reason other than that the appeal, if prosecuted, would be unlikely --- even very unlikely --- to succeed. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 980">It is not necessary, or appropriate, to consider the merits of the substantive application in detail. Only "the most cursory examination of the merits to the proposed proceedings" is appropriate: Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2008] FCA 1784 at [6] . 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 743">More recently, however, the importance to be attached to the merits of the appeal has, arguably, been downgraded in its ranking among the criteria to be taken into account by the court in exercising its discretion as to whether or not an extension of time should be granted. For example, in Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2008] FCA 1784 at [5] , Jessup J observed: 
 A party to a proceeding in the Tribunal has an appeal as of right on a question of law. Such an appeal is in the nature of a new proceeding in the original jurisdiction of the court. It is unnecessary for an applicant in such an appeal to have grounds of any particular strength or intrinsic merit (although I recognise, of course, the relevance of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) in these, as in all other, original proceedings). For this reason (and perhaps the more so because of the availability of s 31A) , I consider that the court should be slow to reject an application for an extension of time under s 44(2A) of the AAT Act, where otherwise the principles in Hunter are appropriately satisfied, for no reason other than that the appeal, if prosecuted, would be unlikely --- even very unlikely --- to succeed. I note that this was effectively the approach taken by the court in Mustafa v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2000] FCA 1897 and in Wiegand v Comcare Australia [2005] FCA 1904. I consider that such an approach would be consistent with that taken by Fitzgerald J in Lucic [ v Nolan (1982) 45 ALR 411] and, because his Honour followed Lucic , by Wilcox J in Hunter . 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 154">The substantial part of the respondents' resistance to the present application was their submission that the proposed appeal, as foreshadowed by the applicant, would be bound to fail. The approach which the court should take to a submission of that kind, in my view, is that to which I referred in Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2008] FCA 1784 , at pars [5]-[6]. Culley arose under s 44(2A) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 ("the AAT Act"), but the terms thereof are relevantly indistinguishable from those of s 46(2) of the Act. </sentence>
