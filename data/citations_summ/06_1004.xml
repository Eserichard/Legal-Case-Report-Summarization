<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWDC 87">For an agreement in principle to operate as a variation, there must be consideration. The mere forbearance by one party to a contract concerning performance of obligations by the other does not effect a variation of the contract unless it is supported by consideration or recorded in a deed under seal: Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 1004 at [141] - [142], Agricultural &amp; Rural Finance Pty Ltd v Gardener [2008] HCA 57 at [68] , [84] and [96]. The applicant sought to rely upon Electronic Industries Ltd David Jones Ltd [1954] HCA 69 ; (1954) 91 CLR 288 as authority for the proposition that consideration was not necessary where the variation was a change in the date of performance of contractual obligations. However, in that case the High Court did not discuss whether consideration was necessary to support the variation of a contract. The facts in Electronic Industries were very different from those in the present case because, in Electronic Industries , neither party had performed its obligations under the contract.

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 
 THE COURT: 
 
1 On 21 March last the Court delivered judgment allowing the appeal, setting aside the judgment and orders below and ordering that the appellant bring in minutes of order covering the orders that should be made in lieu of the orders made below, including costs ( Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corporation Limited [2007] FCAFC 35). The parties have agreed upon some orders but there are issues in relation to both interest and costs which require determination. This judgment should be read with the reasons for judgment on the appeal, together with the judgment below ( Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 1004) as to the substantive issues and the further judgment of the primary judge as to costs and interest ( Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corporation Limited (No 4) [2006] FCA 1779). We shall not repeat the background to, or the substance of, those judgments.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCAFC 35">
 This is an appeal from the judgment in Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 1004. The principal question turns upon the effect of one phrase in one clause of an agreement to provide management services. The clause, with the relevant phrase emphasised, is as follows: 
 
 '8. This contention is based upon the passage from Carter J, 'Termination' in Furmston M (ed), The Law of Contract (2 nd ed, Butterworths Common Law Series, LexisNexis UK, 2003) at par 7.4 p 1319 cited by the primary Judge [2006] FCA 1004 at [170] and some statements by Lord Diplock in Paal Wilson &amp; Co A/S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal (The Hannah Blumenthal) [1983] 1 AC 854 at 915 and Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd [1980] UKHL 2 ; [1980] AC 827 at 849. It is submitted that termination of a contract by agreement, by contrast with termination for breach or default, generally involves the discharge of all obligations.  The primary Judge identified the following questions for consideration ([2006] FCA 1004 at [152]): 
 
 
 '1. Was the Agreement of May 1999 discharged or varied on 29 September 2000? 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. If it was discharged, was that discharge a termination within the meaning of cl 8.6 which gave rise to an entitlement to a Termination Payment? 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. If the discharge was a termination within the meaning of cl 8.6, did it flow from an agreement which extinguished any such entitlement? ' 
 
 
 
  The operative part of his Honour's reasons for rejecting the claim were as follows ([2006] FCA 1004 at [175]---[176]): 
 
 'The question arises whether by cl 8.6 Martech was entitled to a termination payment in the event of a discharge by agreement. Absent clear words, I do not construe cl 8.6 as extending to such a case. The bases and terms upon which parties to an agreement may agree to discharge it are many and various. The primary Judge found that the Agreement was consensually discharged on 29 September 2000 in view of the appointment of another person as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Energy World on that day and Brand's relinquishment of that office on that day ([2006] FCA 1004 at [163]). The background to, and the aftermath of, the events of 29 September 2000 are detailed by the primary Judge ([2006] FCA 1004 at [8]---[71]) and need not be repeated in full.
