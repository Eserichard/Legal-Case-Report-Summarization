<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 108">A subpoena should be set aside if: it is unreasonably wide or used as a fishing expedition ( Tamawood Ltd v Habitare Developments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 364) ; it is used as a substitute for discovery ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Shell Co of Australia Ltd [1999] FCA 212 ; (1999) 161 ALR 686) ; and/or the documents sought do not have an apparent relevance to the issues in the principal proceeding ( Plastec Australia Pty Ltd v Plumbing Solutions and Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2010] FCA 670). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1022">In my view, neither the subpoena nor the notice to produce was issued for a proper purpose in that none of the categories of documents sought had an apparent relevance to the issues raised by the present motion for an adjournment of the principal proceeding or for a limited conditional stay: see Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 90 at 102-103; Spencer Motors Pty Ltd v LNC Industries Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 921 at 927; Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 5) [2005] FCA 510 ; (2005) 216 ALR 147 at [10] ; Tamawood Ltd v Habitare Developments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 364 at [13] ; Campaign Master (UK) Ltd v Forty Two International Pty Ltd (No 4) [2010] FCA 398 ; (2010) 269 ALR 76 at [37] ---[40]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 398">In relation to the first ground, Beaumont J in Arnotts (at 103) posed questions to the following effect: Does the material sought have an apparent relevance to the issues in the principal proceeding, ie, is adjectival, as distinct from substantive, relevance established? Does the subpoena have a legitimate forensic purpose to this extent? In a similar vein, Waddell J in Spencer Motors Pty Ltd v LNC Industries Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 921 at 927 invoked the question whether the material that is sought "is reasonably likely to add, in the end, in some way or other, to the relevant evidence in the case": see also Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 5) [2005] FCA 510 ; (2005) 216 ALR 147 at [10] ; Cosco Holdings Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1997] FCA 1504 ; (1997) 37 ATR 432 at 439-440. In Tamawood Limited v Habitare Developments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 364 at [13] and [35]-[38] Collier J addressed the issue by asking whether it appears to be "on the cards" that the document sought will materially assist the party on whose request the subpoena has been issued: see Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 414 per Gibbs CJ. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 196">Although the rules governing the issuing of subpoenas vary slightly from the Federal Court, the principles governing when leave ought to be granted to issue a subpoena are set out in McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1233. The principle referred to in McIlwain is quoted also in Tamawood Ltd v Habitare Developments Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 364 per Collier J at [12] where her Honour stated: Principles governing the grant of leave by the Court to issue subpoenas were considered in detail by Greenwood J in McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1233. In that case his Honour observed, so far as is relevant in these proceedings, that: a request for a subpoena cannot be used to disguise an application for discovery of documents, or as an alternative to an application for further and better discovery; the documents for production must be identified with reasonable particularity; the category of documents must not be so wide as to be oppressive; the material sought must have an adjectival relevance, that is, an apparent relevance to the issues in the principal proceedings. The adjectival relevance looks towards the possibility whether the material sought could reasonably be expected to throw light on some of the issues in the principal proceedings (cf Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Limited (1989) 88 ALR 90) ; more specifically, the documents must be relevant to an issue raised on the pleadings and be used to elicit documents to support the Applicant's existing case. It cannot be used for the purposes of "fishing" or for the purpose of determining a preliminary question as to whether a party has a supportable case; there must be a legitimate forensic purpose for the production of documents; a wide-ranging subpoena seeking documents of doubtful relevance at great inconvenience to, or that risk compromising the commercial privacy of, a third party, may not readily attract the grant of leave; the issue of the subpoena must not, in all the circumstances, be oppressive in terms of its impact on the recipient. </sentence>
