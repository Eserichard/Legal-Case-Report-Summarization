<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 142">5 The trial judge held that the fair was an exhibition and that it was "officially recognised". However, he held that it was not an "official" exhibition or an "international" exhibition. In the circumstances, the fair did not fall within s 47 of the 1906 Act and the display at the fair of the mattress to which the design had been applied deprived the design of novelty ( Chiropedic Bedding Pty Ltd v Radburg Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1869 ; (2007) 243 ALR 334). The trial judge entered judgment in favour of the respondent on the relevant paragraph in the cross-claim and he also ordered that the registration of the design be expunged from the register. The trial judge granted the appellant leave to appeal from his orders and he stayed the operation of certain orders. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 816">19 Nevertheless, the purposive approach to statutory construction is not a carte blanche licence to courts to depart from unambiguous plain meaning. While purpose may sometimes be used to add, subtract, or clarify words in a statute or regulation ( Saraswati [1991] HCA 21 ; 172 CLR 1 at 22),
 ... where the text of a legislative provision is grammatically capable of only one meaning and neither the context nor any purpose of the Act throws any real doubt on that meaning, the grammatical meaning is "the ordinary meaning" to be applied. A court cannot depart from "the ordinary meaning" of a legislative provision simply because that meaning produces anomalies[. ] 
See also SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83 at [44] - [45] (noting that where a party contends that a provision should not be given its literal or plain meaning, such a contention may lack force absent a plausible competing construction). The only exception to this rule is where the ordinary meaning would lead not just to an anomaly, but to a result that is "manifestly absurd" or "unreasonable": Saraswati [1991] HCA 21 ; 172 CLR 1 at 22; see also Chiropedic Bedding Pty Ltd v Radburg Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1869 ; (2007) 74 IPR 398 at [23] .</sentence>
