<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCAFC 151">27 It is well accepted that the modern approach to statutory interpretation is both purposive and contextual: Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), s 15AA ; CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2 ; (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408. It is a matter of no little regret that, with s 494B of the Migration Act prescribing an easily understood and intelligible regime for the giving of documents to a person, those who drafted reg 2.55 did not adhere to that template but, rather, resorted to their own idiosyncratic language --- no more so than in the use of "post box address". The reason for regret is the greater because it has occasioned an unnecessary dispute over terminology which properly construed in context means no more than "postal address for service" or "postal address for correspondence". The terms in the present context appear to be interchangeable, as is reflected both in judicial decision on the "giving" or "service" of documents and in departmental forms when considered in the context of the Act and Regulations: see e.g. SZJIP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 694 at [6] and [19]; SZITK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 164 at [3] and [7]; SZHUT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1022 at [3] and [7]; Murphy v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 657 ; (2004) 135 FCR 550 at [5] - [10], [27] and [68]-[72].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1476">12 Upon reading the Tribunal's decision, it is apparent that the Tribunal found the claim of the appellant to be unsubstantiated and lacking information, and that independent country information was not relied upon by the Tribunal in reaching its decision. It was because of the deficiency in the information provided that the Tribunal reached the decision adverse to the appellant. No details of the appellants alleged practise of Falun Gong was provided and the Tribunal could not be satisfied that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution in the PRC for this reason. Where an applicant is unable to satisfy the Tribunal of the merits of its application, s 424A(1) of the Act is not enlivened: see SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195 at [29] ; SZCIA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238 at [9] - [12]; SZGER v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1162 at [8] ; SZHUT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1022 at [10] ; SZCCF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1089 at [21] ; SZBZO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 474 at [48] - [49].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1457">15 No detail was provided by the appellant concerning this alleged breach. The Tribunal's obligation pursuant to s 424A only extends to information which the Tribunal considers would be a reason, or part of a reason, for affirming the decision under review. The Tribunal's reasons confirm that it was unable to reach a decision favourable to the appellant because of the absence of information provided. Section 424A(1) does not arise in these circumstances: see SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195 at [29] ; SZCIA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238 at [9] - [12]; SZGER v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1162 at [8] ; SZHUT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1022 at [10] ; SZCCF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1089 at [21] ; SZBZO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 474 at [48] - [49].</sentence>
