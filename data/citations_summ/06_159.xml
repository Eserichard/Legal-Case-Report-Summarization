<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] NSWSC 1386">24 This court accepted an undertaking of the kind now contemplated in Brolrik Pty Ltd v Sambah Holdings Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 1171 ; (2001) 40 ACSR 361. The Federal Court recently adopted the same course in Re De Groot and Sydney Dive Centre Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 159. In GIO Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd v Advance International (Australia) Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 261 , this court again accepted an undertaking but on the express footing that it would be replaced by a subordination of the debt owing to the associated party by means of 

"an appropriate subordination arrangement, by which I mean that the contractual basis of the debt should be varied so that, as between the parties, restrictions will apply equivalent to those in the undertaking to the court, with the subordination so structured that a simple amending contract of the parties cannot undo it.
