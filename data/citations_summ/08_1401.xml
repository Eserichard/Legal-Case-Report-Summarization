<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1669">14 As I recently noted in a statutory interpretation case, it is always possible in hindsight to think of contractual or statutory language that would have more clearly addressed the issue now in dispute: Asciano Services Pty Ltd (formerly Pacific National (ACT) Limited) v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1401 at [22] - [23]. As a general matter, however, hindsight arguments only highlight what is already apparent - in this case, that the Deed was not artfully drafted and cl 2.1(j) did not deal expressly with taking photographs. But I greatly doubt the Deed is properly described as ambiguous. Moreover, even if it is, in the absence of a presumption in favour of either side as to how the ambiguity should be resolved (and neither side sought to argue contra proferentem, likely because that would have required going behind the forbidden veil of the mediation: see [15] below), I do not find such hindsight arguments useful. </sentence>
