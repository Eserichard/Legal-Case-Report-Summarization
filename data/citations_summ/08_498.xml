<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 40">The trial of the UWA proceedings before French J (as his Honour then was) was very lengthy. UWA's claims against Dr Gray and Sirtex were dismissed with costs. UWA's claim against CRI had been settled prior to trial. Much of the cross-claim against Dr Gray and the whole of the cross-claim against CRI failed because they depended upon the success of UWA's claim. However, part of Sirtex's cross-claim against Dr Gray was upheld and the assessment of damages was stood over for a later hearing. Dr Gray was ordered to pay the costs of Sirtex of its cross-claim against him. The parties in respect of whom costs orders had been made, which included Sirtex, were granted liberty to file and serve written submissions on or before 8 May 2008 seeking a variation of the costs order. It was open by that means for Sirtex to have applied for indemnity costs on its cross-claim against Dr Gray. It did not do so: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 20) [2008] FCA 498 ; (2008) 246 ALR 603. </sentence>

Some insight into the dividing line between invention and verification is found in the decision of French J at first instance in University of Western Australia v Gray (No 20) [2008] FCA 498 , (2008) 246 ALR 603. His Honour considered the approach to entitlement in the United States of America, and particularly the decision of the US Court of Appeals in Burroughs Wellcome Co v Barr Laboratories Inc , [1994] USCAFED 1225 ; 40 F 3d 1223 (Fed Cir, 1994).

Dr Kaczmarek's submissions concerning the validity and application of the commercialisation agreement are somewhat unclear. It seems that, in particular, he is under the impression that the decision of Justice French (as he then was) in University of Western Australia v Grey [2008] FCA 498 assists his position. However Grey at first instance and on appeal ( University of Western Australia v Gray [2009] FCAFC 116) was concerned with presumptions at law relating to the ownership of inventions made by university employees in the course of their employment. It is not a basis for suggesting that an assignment of any interest he has to another party is invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1229">On 20 October 2009, I heard submissions from counsel for the second respondent (Sirtex) and the first respondent (Dr Gray) concerning the issues that may be agitated at the hearing of the application of Sirtex for assessment of damages payable by Dr Gray, which hearing is listed to commence on 9 November 2009. The assessment of damages follows the handing down of the primary judgment of French J on 17 April 2008: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 20) (2008) 246 ALR 603 ; 76 IPR 222 ; [2008] FCA 498 ; and the order of French J made 15 August 2008: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 22) [2008] FCA 1315.  The submissions dated 23 September 2009 filed on behalf of Dr Gray are primarily concerned with two issues: First, whether the legal costs which Sirtex seeks to recover as damages against Dr Gray are recoverable at law, as damages in these proceedings. Dr Gray wishes to submit that Sirtex cannot recover any part of the legal costs it has incurred in these proceedings as damages in the same proceedings. Dr Gray says this is a question of law and does not depend upon evidence and is not a point on which evidence could conceivably be given by Sirtex so as to prevent the submission from succeeding. Secondly, the manner in which the Court should assess the damages claimed by Sirtex. In that regard the quantification of Sirtex's damages depends upon the value of the lost opportunity identified by French J at [1612] of the primary judgment in this proceeding: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 20) [2008] FCA 498 ; (2008) 246 ALR 603 at 987. That is to say an opportunity for Sirtex to resolve its dispute with UWA prior to the commencement of these proceedings. The submission of Dr Gray would address applicable legal principles, the degree of probability that a settlement would have been concluded between Sirtex and UWA and the likely form of any such settlement. The submission would rely on evidence already adduced in the primary proceeding as well as the affidavit of Dr Gray affirmed on 23 September 2009. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] WASC 213">91 When dealing with the scope of the fiduciary duty by Messrs Streeter and Cooper to the plaintiff, counsel submitted that contractual provisions may affect the scope of the fiduciary duty and that in cases dealing with an employee's fiduciary duties to the employer, the content of the duty depends as much as anything upon the nature and terms of the employment because the fiduciary relationship must be consistent with, and conform to, the terms of the contract. For this somewhat unexceptionable proposition counsel cited Victoria University of Technology v Wilson [2004] VSC 33 ; (2004) 60 IPR 597 [145] where Nettle J cited Mason J in the Hospital Products case and also referred to the decision of French J, as his Honour then was, in University of Western Australia v Gray [2008] FCA 498 , [1359] - [1360]; [2008] FCA 498 ; (2008) 246 ALR 603 , 629. That submission does not lead anywhere in the present case. The plaintiff does not assert that either Mr Streeter or Mr Cooper was ever its employee. Nor do the first or second defendants refer to any contractual provisions between them and the company as possibly attenuating or circumscribing their fiduciary duties to the company as directors. Furthermore, in Hospital Products , at the passage cited (at page 97) Mason J said:
 
 It must not be forgotten that in a large number of instances the employee's fiduciary duty to his employer, not to compete or not to make a profit at the employer's expense, will be an implied term in the contract arising from the obligation to be just and faithful to the employer and, when that is the situation, will be just as powerful and effective as if it were an express term of the contract of employment. </sentence>

Furthermore, a recent Patent Office decision ( The Commonwealth of Australia v John Murray Charlesworth [2008] APO 16) involved an entitlement dispute where, like the present case, inventorship was not in dispute but rather whether the invention was conceived during a period covered by an agreement between the parties.

The cross-claims by Dr Gray and Sirtex against UWA were also dismissed.
