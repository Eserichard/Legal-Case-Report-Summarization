<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1074">The enactment history makes clear that the terms were deliberately chosen not to say so. Keane JA, despite his reference to the "trend of established [first instance] authority", does not say so. In my respectful view, to the extent that decisions such as IMB Group (1999) ATPR 41-704 ; Blacker [2000] FCA 681 ; Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 ; Lewarne [2007] FCA 1136 and Emerald Ocean [2006] ATPR 42-096 say, or may be taken as saying, that the legal or persuasive onus of proof is shifted to the representor by s 51A(2), they are wrong. None examined the enactment history of s 51A. If it be thought, contrary to my reading of Keane JA's reasons, that his Honour's reference to Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 as "established authority" was a conclusion that s 51A(2) effected a reversal of the legal and persuasive onus of proof, I would be driven to the respectful view that his Honour was plainly wrong for the reasons that I have given.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 963">92 Trade Practices Act s 51A (and Fair Trading Act s 41) provides that where a person makes a representation with respect to any future matter and the person does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation then it shall be taken to be misleading: Trade Practices Act s 51A(1). The onus of establishing that a person had reasonable grounds for making the representation lies on the maker: Trade Practices Act s 51A(2). Trade Practices Act , s 51A(2) effects the reversal of the evidential burden of proof rather than an absolute reversal of the onus of proof, by deeming a person who makes a representation of a future matter not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation unless the person adduces evidence to the contrary: Re McGrath; Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited (in liq) v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 2 ; (2008) 165 FCR 230 per Allsop J. Some judges have taken the view that the section does indeed reverse the onus of proof and that a person making the representation can only avoid the deeming provision by establishing on the usual balance of probabilities that there were reasonable grounds for making the representation: Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1136 per Stone J and Downey v Carlson Hotels Asia Pacific Pty Ltd [2005] QCA 199. The preset proceedings do not turn on the difference between whether the defendants bear an evidential burden in the sense of an obligation to adduce evidence, rather than imposing upon the defendants the legal or persuasive burden to prove they had reasonable grounds for making the representations alleged. The debate provides a useful illustration though of the scope of the section which has been commonly applied, for example, to representations as to the profit potential of future returns from products: Digi-Tech (Australia) Ltd v Brand [2004] NSWCA 58 , ACCC v IMB Group Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 402 and Jacques v Cut Price Deli Pty Ltd (1993) ATPR 46-102. A restriction on the operation of this section is that it cannot be relied upon in proceedings for accessorial liability: Quinlivan v ACCC [2004] FCAFC 175. Mr George Dib is joined as an accessory to the Dib Group's alleged contravention of Trade Practices Act , s 52. However, here Fair Trading Act , s 41 is pleaded against him as a principal.</sentence>

In the ordinary case where a representation as to future conduct or events is alleged to have been made, that means that the burden would be upon the applicant to show not merely that the conduct or event has not come to pass but also that at the time the representation was made the respondent did not believe that the conduct or event would come to pass or that there was no basis for a belief that the conduct or event would come to pass: James v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (1986) 64 ALR 347 ; Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88; [1984] FCA 180 ; 55 ALR 25. It will be readily apparent that a representation as to future conduct or a future event will generally imply (and sometimes explicitly state) that the maker of the representation was of a particular state of mind as to the future conduct or event as at the time the representation was made. ...

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1364">

277 It has been suggested that, because the deeming within the meaning of s 51A(2) takes effect unless the corporation adduces some evidence to the contrary, this does not mean that the onus of proof (which otherwise lies with the applicant) is reversed, but merely requires the corporation to go into evidence ( ACCC v Universal Sports Challenge Ltd [2002] FCA 1276 at [46] ). The weight of authority however is that the person making the representation can only avoid the deeming in s 51A(2) by establishing on the usual balance of probabilities that there were reasonable grounds for making the representation: Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1136 at [82] , Ting [1993] FCA 524 ; 118 ALR 543 at 552, Bowler v Hilda Pty Ltd (1998) 153 ALR 95 at 108 and 117, Sykes 88 FCR 511 at 513-514, Adelaide Petroleum NL &amp; Ors v Poseidon Limited &amp; Ors (1988) 10 ATPR 40-901 at 49,700, Phoenix Court Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 (and cf other cases in support of this proposition listed at Miller , 29th ed para 1.51A.37).</sentence>

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 (revised from transcript) 
 I have before me a creditor's petition which was listed today for hearing after two adjournments by consent, the petition being filed on 13 December 2007. The petitioner is, in effect, the receiver of a partnership relating to a hotel business which has been placed in receivership by order of Stone J. The partners were the parties to the proceedings before her Honour which gave rise to her Honour's judgments in Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1136 and Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1530. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCAFC 2">In ACCC v Henry Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 at [130] - [133], Kenny J specifically referred to Universal Sports Challenge [2002] FCA 1276 and said that Emmett J was wrong. Her Honour followed what she considered to be the effect of the authorities to which Dowsett J had referred in Danoz Direct [2003] FCA 881. Nicholson J took the same approach in Emerald Ocean [2005] FCA 1703 at [176] , following "the weight of authority, at least until the issue is authoritatively decided otherwise". In Lewarne [2007] FCA 1136 , Stone J also refused to accept Emmett J's views in Universal Sports Challenge [2002] FCA 1276 , stating at [82]: 

 With respect, I am not inclined to accept this interpretation of s 51A(2). I would read the phrase 'evidence to the contrary' as meaning evidence adduced by the person making the representation that, to the satisfaction of the Court, establishes that there were reasonable grounds for making the representation. In other words, I interpret the subsection as providing that the person making the representation can only avoid the deeming provision by establishing on the usual balance of probabilities that there were reasonable grounds for making the representation. The equivalent provision of the Fair Trading Act, s 41, addresses the question more directly. There is no statutory deeming, merely a clear statement in s 41(2) that the onus of establishing reasonable grounds is on the person making the representation. 
 

 
  Some of these cases refer to s 51A(2) as reversing the persuasive onus: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IMB Group Pty Limited (1999) ATPR 41-704 at [13]; Blacker v National Australia Bank [2000] FCA 681 at [83] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Henry Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 at [133] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Emerald Ocean [2006] FCA 1703 and Lewarne [2007] FCA 1136 .  The enactment history makes clear that the terms were deliberately chosen not to say so. Keane JA, despite his reference to the " trend of established [first instance] authority ", does not say so. In my respectful view, to the extent that decisions such as IMB Group (1999) ATPR 41-704 ; Blacker [2000] FCA 681 ; Henry Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 ; Lewarne [2007] FCA 1136 and Emerald Ocean [2005] FCA 1703 say, or may be taken as saying, that the legal or persuasive onus of proof is shifted to the representor by s 51A(2), they are wrong. None examined the enactment history of s 51A. If it be thought, contrary to my reading of Keane JA's reasons, that his Honour's reference to Henry Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 as "established authority" was a conclusion that s 51A(2) effected a reversal of the legal and persuasive onus of proof, I would be driven to the respectful view that his Honour was plainly wrong for the reasons that I have given.  In Fubilan Catering Services Limited v Compass Group (Australia) Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1205 , French J approved of the views of Emmett J in Universal Sports Challenge [2002] FCA 1276 (though not referring to Stone J in Lewarne [2007] FCA 1136) when he said the following at [545]: 

 The way in which the section was pleaded was close to unintelligible. Paragraph 68 seemed to suggest that it was invoked as an element of the prohibition imposed by s 52. But s 51A "... does not of itself create a cause of action, nor ... define a norm of conduct": Ting v Blanche [1993] FCA 524 ; (1993) 118 ALR 543 at 552 (Hill J). A number of cases have addressed the issue. In a number of decisions in this Court, and elsewhere, the view has been expressed that s 51A(2) effects a reversal of the onus of proof. Sometimes, this has been expressed by some qualification such as referring to it as the "practical" onus of proof, or that "in effect" the onus has been placed on the representor: see generally, Adelaide Petroleum NL v Poseidon Limited (1988) ATPR 40-901 at 49,700; Wheeler Grace &amp; Pierucci Pty Limited v Wright (1989) ATPR 40-940 at 50,254; Ting v Blanche [1993] FCA 524 ; (1993) 118 ALR 543 at 552; Miba Pty Limited v Nescor Industries Group Pty Limited (1996) 141 ALR 525 ; Phoenix Court Pty Limited v Melbourne Central Pty Limited [1997] FCA 1101 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IMB Group Pty Limited (1999) ATPR 41-704 at [13]; Blacker v National Australia Bank [2000] FCA 681 at [83]; City of Botany Bay Council v Jazabas Pty Limited [2001] NSWCA 94 at [85] and [105]; Concrete Construction Group v Litevale Pty Limited [2002] NSWSC 670 ; (2002) ATPR (Digest) 46-224 at [156] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Henry Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 at [133] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Emerald Ocean Distributors Pty Limited [2005] FCA 1703 ; and Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1136. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 1530">1 On 7 August 2007 I delivered a judgment (the 'earlier judgment') on the substantive issues in the above matter; [2007] FCA 1136. At the request of the parties I made no orders for relief or in relation to costs at that time but allowed them a reasonable time to bring in short minutes of order for the resolution of the matter in the light of my findings and reasons. The applicant has supplied short minutes of the orders for which he contends. </sentence>
