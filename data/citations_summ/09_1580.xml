<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 58">The approach adopted in New South Wales was followed by Barker J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1579 where his Honour said at [51]: 
 
 I note that in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd , Finkelstein J of this Court, at [16], noted a number of New South Wales Supreme Court decisions that have followed the course that I now propose to adopt, but different from what his Honour there proposed. In those other decisions the Court had acknowledged the general rule that a declaration on a matter relating to a public or analogous right should not be made by consent. However, those cases considered that a declaration could be made if the Court was satisfied by evidence that it ought to be made, the "evidence" to which regard may be had, including "facts" admitted to be true about which there is no direct evidence --- facts, for example, contained in a statement of agreed facts. I am persuaded that the approach adopted in such cases as Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2004] NSWSC 836 ; (2004) 50 ACSR 500 , referred to by Finkelstein J at [16], provide useful guidance in this regard. 
 

His Honour took the same approach in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Wilson Parking 1992 Pty Ltd (ACN 052 475 911) [2009] FCA 1580. Section 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)
