<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 714">It has been held that an applicant must clearly notify the Tribunal of a change of address for service. [35] Notwithstanding the applicant's statement that he notified the Department of his change of address, he was required to notify the Tribunal directly of his change of address. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 667">It is, as Gilmore J stated in SZBHU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1614 at [65] , for the first respondent to establish that the hearing invitation letter was sent in accordance with s.441A of the Act. No issue was taken with whether the hearing invitation was dated and dispatched by prepaid post within three working days of its date as required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of s.441A(4). It is not disputed that the hearing invitation was dispatched to the applicant at the residential and mail address provided in his review application of 25 February 2005. The first respondent contended that this was the last address for both service and as a residential address provided to the Tribunal by the applicant in connection with the review and that it was not necessary for the Tribunal to send the hearing invitation to the address provided to the Court and to Phillips Fox in connection with the judicial review proceedings. There is no evidence that the solicitors informed the Tribunal of the second Campsie address and I am told that there is no indication on the Tribunal file that the Tribunal itself had any information as to the applicant's second Campsie address prior to its decision.  Section 441A(4) of the Migration Act does not specify the manner in which an applicant may provide an address for service to the Tribunal in connection with the review. In SZBHU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1614 Gilmour J suggested that it would be sufficient if this were done orally by an applicant. Hence, although there is no evidence before the Court as to how or precisely when (apart from the fact that it was during the proceedings) the applicant advised Phillips Fox of his new address, the absence of written notification would not mean that any oral notification could not come within s.441A(4). The difficulty for the applicant is that, however such notification occurred, the applicant did not provide the address to the Tribunal itself or to solicitors acting for the Tribunal in its capacity as a party to the judicial review proceedings, let alone acting for the purposes of or in connection with the review by the Tribunal of the protection visa decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 645">It has been held that the applicant must clearly notify the Tribunal of a change of address for service; SZBHU v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1614 at [45] --- [47], and the cover letter which referred to the Mildura address did not contain any clear or explicit statement that the address utilised in the application had been changed. Whilst I think that this is probably the correct interpretation of the law and, thus, there was no breach of s.425 of the Act, I would add for the sake of completeness that, even if I was wrong in this, I would propose to exercise my discretion not to grant the applicant the relief claimed because I am satisfied that he was aware of the hearing and, thus, any failure by the Tribunal to comply with the provisions of s.441A was technical. </sentence>
