Indeed, as in the present proceeding, in intellectual property cases it is not uncommon for a plaintiff to contend that the conduct of a respondent in using a domain name or a business name constitutes not only a contravention of ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act and the tort of passing off, but also a contravention of the Trade Marks Act : Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Ltd (No 1) [2008] FCA 1760 , 79 IPR 454 ; SAP Australia Pty Ltd v Sapient Australia Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1821 , 169 ALR 1.  There remain, however, a number of differences of potential significance between each of the causes of action.

Software Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1760 at [71] , 79 IPR at 475 per Collier J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 131">55 The appellant argued that the primary judge had misunderstood the nature of the relevant trade mark infringement and therefore had granted injunctive relief that was too narrow in terms. In particular, the appellant argued that her Honour had wrongly concluded that the infringement related only to the use by Bing Technologies of the mark "bing" on software and in documentary references to software: compare Bing! Software [2008] FCA 1760 at [114] . The appellant submitted that her Honour was incorrect in concluding that the first respondent might use the word "bing" to describe itself and the operation of its internet postal service without infringing the appellant's mark; and, further, that, if "bing" did not appear on software, software agreements or computer screens accessed by the first respondent's customers, then the first respondent would only use "bing" to describe itself and its internet postal service and not goods and services the subject of the appellant's mark. 13 The primary judge found that the appellant's and the first respondent's trade marks were not "substantially identical" for the purposes of s 120(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth), but that the first respondent's use of "bing" in its different forms was such that it was deceptively similar to the appellant's mark within the meaning of ss 10 and 120 (1) of the Trade Marks Act : see Bing! Software [2008] FCA 1760 at [37] and [41]. Her Honour gave the following reasons (at [41]) in support of her finding of deceptive similarity:
 
1. The parties' marks all feature the word "bing". 22 Subsequently, counsel for the first respondent explained (at 216; Bing!Software [2008] FCA 1760 at [109] ):
 In terms of the undertaking which has been provided, it's not offered to limit the injunctive relief which would be made, your Honour. It's provided, we say in a way which would avoid there being injunctive relief granted at all if you accepted our submissions in relation to the MID decision, the SAP decision, the fact that we were not using the mark in respect of the goods and services in respect of which it was registered. The purpose of the undertaking was just to, as I said, quite frankly, to bring ourselves even more squarely within the MID decision.  51 In this case, the primary judge was not persuaded that she should infer from the comparatively limited evidence of confusion that other people were likely to be actually misled or deceived by the first respondent's use of its marks into acting on the basis that the first respondent's and the appellant's goods and services had a common source. The primary judge noted and accepted "the evidence from Mr James Helm and Mr Paul Kenna indicating that a small number of people were actually confused by the first respondent's trade mark into believing (temporarily) that it was related to the applicant": Bing! Software [2008] FCA 1760 at [73] . Her Honour found, however, that the evidence of this misconception in the minds of the public was "minimal" and showed that any confusion was "transient and ephemeral"; and, furthermore, that the instances of initial confusion were resolved "at the point of inquiry": Bing! Software [2008] FCA 1760 at [75] .  7 The appellant uses the mark on "the software (on-screen), on software user guides and on the footer of Family Court documents created using the software", as well as on the appellant's software and marketing materials: see Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 1) [2008] FCA 1760 at [6] . Further, the primary judge found (at [7]) that the appellant "maintains a website www.bing.com.au featuring the Bing Trade Mark, and since 1997 has also developed software products for various markets, all incorporating the word and following exclamation mark 'BING! '".  51 In this case, the primary judge was not persuaded that she should infer from the comparatively limited evidence of confusion that other people were likely to be actually misled or deceived by the first respondent's use of its marks into acting on the basis that the first respondent's and the appellant's goods and services had a common source. The primary judge noted and accepted "the evidence from Mr James Helm and Mr Paul Kenna indicating that a small number of people were actually confused by the first respondent's trade mark into believing (temporarily) that it was related to the applicant": Bing! Software [2008] FCA 1760 at [73] . Her Honour found, however, that the evidence of this misconception in the minds of the public was "minimal" and showed that any confusion was "transient and ephemeral"; and, furthermore, that the instances of initial confusion were resolved "at the point of inquiry": Bing! Software [2008] FCA 1760 at [75] .  

30 In another set of reasons for judgment --- Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 3 ) [2008] FCA 1869 at [7] --- the primary judge explained her position as follows:
 &#8226; I found in Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 1) [2008] FCA 1760 that compliance by the first respondent with its undertaking meant a cessation of conduct infringing the applicant's trade mark, and that injunctive relief in terms of that undertaking was appropriate. In my view the alternative wording of the injunction more accurately reflects that undertaking than the applicant's preferred wording of the injunction. &#8226; The alternative wording of the injunction addresses the applicant's concerns with respect to such products as BING! 61 The respondents submitted that, since the primary judge was persuaded that, in complying with its undertaking, the first respondent had ceased to infringe the appellant's trade mark (see Bing! Software [2008] FCA 1760 at [111] ), then the primary judge properly granted an injunction in the terms of that undertaking. 26 Paragraph 1(a) of the appellant's amended application of 20 November 2007 had sought a declaration that:
 .. the conduct of the first respondent in using the name or sign BING and trading under the name or style BING in connection with the distribution sale and supply of software within Australia ... infringes the [appellant's] registered Trade Mark numbered 836622 BING!. Paragraph 2 sought an injunction restraining the first respondent "whether by itself, its servants, officers or agents from using within Australia the sign BING or any sign which is deceptively similar to the Bing Trade Mark as a sign in connection with the distribution, sale and supply of software". The primary judge held, however, that an injunction in these terms was not "warranted in light of the undertaking given by the first respondent", but her Honour was "prepared to make an order in terms of the undertaking given by the first respondent through its counsel on 11 March 2008": see Bing! Software [2008] FCA 1760 at [116] . Her Honour declined to grant a number of other orders sought in the appellant's amended application (including for delivery up and destruction, change of corporate name, transfer of domain name) as well as an order for compensatory damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1869">1 On 25 November 2008 I gave judgment in the primary proceedings in this matter ( Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 1) [2008] FCA 1760) and also in relation to a notice of motion filed 16 May 2008 ( Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 1761). In summary, I found that the conduct of the first and second respondents had infringed the applicant's registered trade mark, but that the effect of compliance with an oral undertaking given by the first respondent during the hearing of the primary proceedings was that the infringement of the applicant's registered trade mark by the respondents ceased. Notwithstanding that undertaking however, I allowed the application in part because I considered that the applicant was entitled to an injunction based upon the oral undertaking. Upon giving judgment I directed the parties to make submissions as to the terms of the injunction in light of the reasons given in my judgment. I also directed that the parties make submissions as to costs. However on balance, and after considering the submissions of the parties, I consider it appropriate to make an order in terms of the alternative wording of the injunction proposed by the applicant. I have formed this view because:
 
&#8226; I found in Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 1) [2008] FCA 1760 that compliance by the first respondent with its undertaking meant a cessation of conduct infringing the applicant's trade mark, and that injunctive relief in terms of that undertaking was appropriate. In my view the alternative wording of the injunction more accurately reflects that undertaking than the applicant's preferred wording of the injunction. &#8226; The alternative wording of the injunction addresses the applicant's concerns with respect to such products as BING! 7 In considering the form of the injunctive relief I give little weight to the possibility of a hypothetical purchaser of the applicant's business commencing litigation against the first respondent in ignorance of the reasons for judgment in Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 1) [2008] FCA 1760. However on balance, and after considering the submissions of the parties, I consider it appropriate to make an order in terms of the alternative wording of the injunction proposed by the applicant. I have formed this view because:

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1761">21 As I have noted in my judgment in the primary proceedings ( Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 1) [2008] FCA 1760) an undertaking given by a party to proceedings in Court is enforceable by order of the Court pursuant to O 35 r 11 Federal Court Rules . The submission of the first respondent that it anticipates the applicant submitting that the first respondent "giving the undertaking is not enough" is:
 
&#8226; curious in light of the power of the Court to enforce the undertaking; and
 
&#8226; indicative of the fact that the respondents, in seeking to introduce this additional evidence, are attempting a "second bite" at the case after the trial has concluded.</sentence>
