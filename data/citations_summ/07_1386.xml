<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 834">Other important factors that various decisions of the Court have pointed to in assessing whether the agreement reached was free and informed, include: Whether the parties have independent and competent legal representation: Munn at [29], [39] and [40]. Whether the terms of the proposed order are unambiguous and clear: Patta Warumungu v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 1386 at [20] . Whether the agreement has been preceded by a mediation process: Nankiriny v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 1156 at [6] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1802">27 The Central matters are variously in the process of negotiation. On 3 September 2007, part of the township of Tennant Creek was the subject of a consent determination: Patta Warumungu People v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 1386. At the same time an Indigenous Land Use Agreement in respect of parts of that township was executed. That contemplates further action following the proposed legislative amendment referred to in the preceding paragraph. The parties have reported at directions hearings of the progress of their consideration of the other Central matters claims referred to by the Registrar in his reports. The Court has not made directions for the progress of those matters which have not been complied with, and, as long as the parties adhere to the program which they have indicated, is satisfied, and is likely to remain satisfied with the progress of those claims. Consequently, I do not presently consider that the conditions specified in s 94C(1)(e) for the exercise of the power in s 94C(1) in respect of the five matters identified has arisen.</sentence>
