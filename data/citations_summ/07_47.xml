<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 724">I do not consider that the decision of Sackville J in Power v Comcare [1998] FCA 1783 ; (1998) 89 FCR 514 assists the appellant. That matter concerned the power of the Tribunal to determine whether a condition in respect of which compensation had been paid had in fact ever been causally related to his work: see at 526-527. His Honour's decision on that topic is then reflected in the Full Court in Hannaford as discussed above. Similarly, the decision of Stone J in Lang v Comcare [2007] FCA 47 ; (2007) 94 ALD 141 focused relevantly on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to have made the decision it did at [41]-[52], and then on the adequacy of the reasons for decision of the Tribunal at [53]-[56]. On the latter point, the appeal succeeded. On the issue of onus of proof, her Honour at [24] made it clear that the practical onus which was identified by the nature of the issue the Tribunal was to consider was not altered by the mere fact of the respondent having paid some medical expenses in relation to a condition apparently beyond the accepted injury; that was equally consistent with an error on the respondent's part. Her Honour at [28]-[29] was also satisfied that, although the Tribunal in that case had not specifically referred to the onus of proof, it had in substance correctly applied the onus as explained in Borg . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1057">It may reveal jurisdictional error. The Tribunal's identification of what it considered to be the material questions of fact may demonstrate that it took into account some irrelevant consideration or did not take into account some relevant consideration. 
 

 
See also: Lang v Comcare [2007] FCA 47 at [53] , [2007] FCA 47 ; 94 ALD 141 at 152. Given a statutory requirement to set out " findings on material questions of fact ", the absence of any reference in the reasons for decision of the Tribunal to those findings of fact material to the decision to be reached may preclude a conclusion that the Tribunal impliedly took various considerations into account: Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568 at [27] , [2001] FCA 568 ; 107 FCR 133 at 140. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 241">Section 43 refers to a substantive decision on the merits of the matter and not to each and every preliminary determination on the receipt or rejection of evidence, or to whether or not the Tribunal will allow argument on a specific issue sought to be raised before it. It goes without saying that there is no specific provision obliging the Tribunal to consider a previous Tribunal decision in relation to the same parties. The Tribunal had a duty to record its reasons for the substantive decision and the evidence upon which those reasons where based. The Tribunal was obliged to give reasons in relation to an application made to it. No application was made to the 2008 Tribunal in respect of the weight to be given to the 2001 Tribunal decision, nor did it form part of the evidence tendered by Ms Cheung (cf Lang v Comcare [2007] FCA 47 ; (2007) 94 ALD 141). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 236">64 The Tribunal has an obligation to give reasons that make it possible to understand its reasoning process. Failure to do so is an error of law ( Lang v Comcare [2007] FCA 47 ; (2007) 94 ALD 141 at [54] - [55] per Stone J citing TelePacific Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 158 ; (2005) 218 ALR 85). This includes an obligation to give reasons for rejecting evidence that is plainly central to a party's claim and crucial to a medical report that supported that claim ( Lang at [54] per Stone J). As was pointed out by Stone J in Lang at [53]---[55], the Tribunal is entitled to accept or reject the respective pieces of evidence before it or to accord certain pieces of evidence different weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] AATA 72">We are satisfied that the e-mail Mr Streatfield sent to his employer as a result of his meeting on 17 June 2005 with Ms Worthy is sufficient notice of the injuries described therein. It contains the essential information to be imparted for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the section 53 notice, that is, the nature of the injury or ailment and its connection with the employment [12] . The brevity of the e-mail and the lack of specific detail imparted thereby does not render it impotent as formal notice. </sentence>
