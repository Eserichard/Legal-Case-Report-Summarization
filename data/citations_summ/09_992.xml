<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 144">There can be no argument that a party to proceedings before the AAT whose first language is not English could be denied a reasonable opportunity to present their case if not provided with the assistance of a competent interpreter: see for example, Shu Uan Eao v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 992. This is because that opportunity will be at best illusory if a party is unable to understand what is being said or make themselves understood because of language problems. As Kenny J observed in Perera v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 507 at [24] the function of an interpreter is to redress this problem and : 
 
 ... place the non-English speaker as nearly as possible in the same position as an English speaker. In other words, an interpreter serves to remove any barriers which prevent or impede understanding or communication: see Gradidge v Grace Bros Pty Ltd (1988) 93 FLR at 425 per Samuels JA. An interpreter provides the means for communication between the applicant, the Tribunal and other participants in the Tribunal hearing, in cases where the applicant's own linguistic capacities are not, on their own, sufficient to that end.
