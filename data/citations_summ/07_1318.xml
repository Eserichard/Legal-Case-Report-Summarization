<citphrase id="cp42.15" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">migration act 1958 (cth), ss 6 , 6a. in an application for review of a decision of the minister for immigration and ethnic affairs made in 1984 refusing an application for a permanent entry permit to an applicant who was the spouse of a permanent resident on the basis that the applicant's marriage had been assessed as being one where the parties did not genuinely intend to continue living as a married couple in australia, it being the minister's policy to refuse permanent entry permits in such cases.  held: (1) that relevant considerations which should have been taken into account were not, thus making the minister's decision invalid pursuant to s 5(2)(b) of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (the act), such considerations being:  (i) a report made in 1981 by an interviewing officer in suva expressing an opinion that the marriage relationship was genuine, such report being part of the history of the relationship, all of which was relevant in determining the quality of the marriage as at the date of the minister deciding the application. although the report was not presented to the minister, it was on the departmental file and was accordingly to be regarded as being constructively before him.  peko-wallsend ltd v. minister for aboriginal affairs (1985) 59 alr 51 , referred to.  (ii) statutory declarations of neighbours and acquaintances as to the applicant leading a normal married life and a letter of a social worker as to the applicant's wife living at home with the applicant, such documents being available to the minister, but there being nothing to indicate that he had taken any account of them.  (2) that in determining whether an administrative decision made under statutory authority falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp42.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 160">The applicant submitted that SZIAI had not eroded the principle enunciated by Kenny J in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le and Others (2007) 164 FCR 151; [2007] FCA 1318 at [63] as follows: The concept of vitiating unreasonableness has been extended to the manner in which a decision was made. Thus, a failure by a decision-maker to obtain important information on a critical issue, which the decision-maker knows or ought reasonably to know is readily available, may be characterised as so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker would [have] proceeded to make the decision without making the enquiry. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 93">25 However, that ground cannot be supported, as the High Court recently observed in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 ; (2009) 259 ALR 429 at [25] --- [26], the duty imposed upon the Tribunal by the Migration Act is a duty of review. A failure to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact, the existence of which could be easily ascertained may, in some circumstances, supply a sufficient link to the outcome to constitute a failure to review. That may, in some cases, be sufficient to ground a finding of jurisdictional error, but such cases are rare and exceptional: see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [60] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 19">Mr Jones referred to Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 (" Le ") at [55] per Kenny J, where her Honour quotes: "... To quote Sir William Wade and Christopher Forsyth in Administrative Law (9 th ed, 2004, Oxford University Press) at 292: 'Where the validity of an administrative act or order is attacked, the incidence of the burden of proof may vary with the circumstances. The burden of proof naturally lies in the first instance upon the plaintiff or complainant. Whether he can transfer it to the defendant public authority depends upon the nature of the act. '" </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 1001">First, the applicant relies on Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 (" SZIAI ") at [25]. Of course what was explained there must also be understood by this Court in the context of what was also said in SZMJM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 309 per Bennett J (with reference to Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 per Kenny J at [60]) at [30]: "... A Tribunal's failure to inquire may ground a finding of jurisdictional error because the failure renders the ensuing decision manifestly unreasonable, but such circumstances are rare and exceptional ..." </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 984">The first respondent submits that the authorities established that the Tribunal has no general obligation to initiate enquires or to make out an applicant's case. See Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [60] and the authorities referred to therein. It is further submitted, that on the other hand, there is authority for the limited proposition that, in certain rare or exceptional circumstances, the Tribunal's failure to enquire may ground a finding of jurisdictional error because the failure may render the ensuing decision manifestly unreasonable in the sense used in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp. [1948] 1 KB 223. It is the first respondent's submission that the present case is not a case which involves unreasonableness in the Wednesbury sense.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 1041">The appellants relied on the decision of the High Court in SZIAI as authority for the proposition that in this case, the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by failing to make inquiries. Prior to SZIAI , it had been held in this Court that a failure to inquire could, in certain circumstances, amount to jurisdictional error. In Prasad v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 , Wilcox J held (at 170): 
 
 But, in a case where it is obvious that material is readily available which is centrally relevant to the decision to be made, it seems to me that to proceed to a decision without making any attempt to obtain that information may properly be described as an exercise of the decision-making power in a manner so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have so exercised it. 
 

To similar effect is the decision of Kenny J in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 , in which her Honour held that in the circumstances of that case (which she described as "exceptional") the failure to make an inquiry constituted Wednesbury unreasonableness. Her Honour relevantly held at [79]:
 
 
 ...the present is a case where the failure by a decision-maker to make a straightforward enquiry for information that was apparently readily available and relevant to critical issues can be characterised as unreasonable in the Wednesbury Corporation sense.

The critical underlying question remains whether the decision is vitiated by jurisdictional error. The failure to inquire must constitute a failure to undertake the statutory duty of review or otherwise be so unreasonable as to support a finding that the Tribunal's decision was infected by jurisdictional error (SZIAI at [26]; see also Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Dhanoa [2009] FCAFC 153 ; (2009) 180 FCR 510 at [46] ---[51] per Jagot and Foster JJ and SZNBX v Minister of Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1403 at [30] per Bennett J).

The Tribunal is normally not bound to make further inquiries to establish the authenticity or truth of corroborative documents, and there is no circumstance in the present case which brings the situation within the extraordinary circumstances in which a duty to make further inquiries might arise. I have assumed that Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZIAI (2009) 259 ALR 429 , [2009] HCA 39 at [25] gives continuing life to the principles previously applied in cases such as Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [77] , and SZJBA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 at [59] - [60].

It has not been established that there is any arguable case that it misdirected itself, failed to take into account a relevant consideration or acted in a " capricious or unreasonable manner " ( MZXTA at [32]) in the exercise of its discretion under s.426A.

Telstra submits that this statutory duty may be no less than the duty developed at common law in connection with Wednesbury unreasonableness, and refers to Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-170 per Wilcox J; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 ; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [60] - [79]; Visa International v Reserve Bank of Australia [2003] FCA 977 ; (2003) 131 FCR 300 at [623] - [627].

No jurisdictional error arises from this omission.

It was the Tribunal's overall assessment of the evidence given by the applicant at the hearing in relation to her understanding of Christianity and her claimed faith and other aspects of her claims which led it to conclude that she was not a credible witness. While one aspect of that evidence was her responses to questioning about her understanding of Christianity and the Shouters faith, the Tribunal was entitled to have regard to information from third parties when assessing the applicant's claims. There was evidence before it on which it could form a view that the applicant's knowledge about the person known as Witness Lee was relevant to the credibility of her claim to be a Shouter (but see NATC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 52 at [25] --- [27]).

It is also clearly distinguishable from SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 98 ALD 270. See also SZICU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 1 at [29] .

<sentence id="cs88" from="[2008] FMCA 217">The circumstances are not such that the Tribunal decision has been shown to be illogical in a manner constituting jurisdictional error. In reaching this conclusion I have had regard to principles of unreasonableness in the context of the Migration Act (as to which see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 97 ALD 112 and the general statement of principle by Kenny J at [63] to [64]). This is of particular relevance insofar as it may be intended to suggest that the Tribunal failed to obtain information on the extent of the applicant's injuries or to seek medical evidence in that context. This is not a case in which the decision was unreasonable in a manner constituting an improper exercise of power on the principles that were considered in cases such as Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155. Nor more generally, is it a case in which unreasonableness has been established in the sense of a failure to act judicially as discussed by Allsop J in NADH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 at [131] ---[135] and see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 77ALJR 1165 at [8] and [9] per Gleeson CJ and [34] --- [37] per McHugh and Gummow JJ. It has not been established that the Tribunal acted capriciously, arbitrarily or by whim. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs89" from="[2008] FMCA 26">If a decision whether or not to exercise the discretionary power under s.427 to summon a witness or to require the Secretary to make an investigation was so unreasonable that no reasonable Tribunal could ever have made it, then it may ground a finding of jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 per Kenny J at [60]-[64]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs90" from="[2007] FCA 1592">60 The same conclusion is to be reached by the application of the principles that in certain circumstances the decision of a Tribunal or decision-maker will be vitiated if some inquiry is not made. Most recently, Kenny J examined these cases in her Honour's comprehensive judgment in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318. It can readily accepted, as her Honour said, that there is no general obligation to inquire found in s 424(7), nor is there a general obligation to initiate inquiries or to make an applicant's case for him or her. I refer, without repetition, to the long list of cases referred to by Kenny J in Le [2007] FCA 1318 at [60] .

I refer, without repetition, to the long list of cases referred to by Kenny J in Le [2007] FCA 1318 at [60] . The absence of such a general obligation of inquiry can be accepted, without denying the limited proposition supported by numerous other cases that, in certain exceptional cases, a failure to make some inquiry may ground a finding of jurisdictional error if it was plainly necessary to make some reasonably straightforward inquiry before the making of the relevant decision: Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-70. Kenny J discusses this in Le at [60]-[67].</sentence>
