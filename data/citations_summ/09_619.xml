<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 447">It is part of the substantive law [145] and not simply part of the rules of evidence, by which the Tribunal is not bound. [146] The Tribunal must be mindful of concurrent proceedings or investigations involving those who come to it lest its administrative proceedings be regarded as constituting a contempt of criminal proceedings, as prejudicing, undermining or interfering with the conduct of those criminal proceedings or undermining the right of a person facing prosecution against self-incrimination. [147] 
 
 
100. The extent to which it is bound depends on the enactments conferring jurisdiction and powers, whether express or necessarily implicit, on the Tribunal and on the substantive law and not on adjectival law or matters of procedure that attend the exercise of jurisdiction in a particular court or in a court of a particular character or status. [148] That follows from the fact that the Tribunal is a creation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (AAT Act).</sentence>
