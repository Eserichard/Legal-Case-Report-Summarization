Thereafter, if those orders are to be varied, recourse must be had to O 25 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules or s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): Metso Minerals (Australia) Ltd v Kalra (No 2) [2007] FCA 2108.  5 Once the materials and documents had been seized, the order was thereafter first varied, with the consent of those from whom the materials had been seized, on 14 December 2007 ( Metso Minerals (Australia) Ltd v Kalra (No 2) [2007] FCA 2108).
