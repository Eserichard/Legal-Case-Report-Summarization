<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1357">Fourth, the proposed scheme is an "intra-group" scheme, that is to say, the policies are being transferred not from one corporate group to another, but within the Swiss Re group. Because the transfer will not involve any real change in the practices and "culture" of the insurer, there seems to be a reduced imperative for notification. This consideration has been relied upon as supporting the granting of a dispensation: MMIA Pty Limited and QBE Insurance (Australia) Limited [2008] FCA 1239 at [24] ; Calliden Group Limited at [62]. </sentence>
