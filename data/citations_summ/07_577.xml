<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 350">The proposed appeal, as one from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court under s 24(1)(d) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is not an appeal de novo, nor is it an appeal in the strict sense. As with appeals from a judgment of a single judge of this Court it is by way of a rehearing of the initial application: Murdaca v Accounts Control Management Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 577 at [12] . The Court's powers on such an appeal are exercisable only if the appellant can demonstrate that, having regard to the evidence before the appellate court, the judgment under appeal is a consequence of some legal, factual or discretionary error: Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1558 at [4] . In short, an error by the Federal Magistrates Court would have to be shown: MZWVH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1016. Consideration

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 600">On or about 17 October 2007 or 18 October 2007, after Mr. Marzukie had been served with this Appeal's filed documents, I received 3 phone calls from Mrs. Marzukie, which I did not answer, and an SMS message from her "Offering me part-time work", which I did not respond to. 
 
 CONSIDERATION 
 
18 The first issue in this appeal is the resolution of the appellant's application seeking leave to adduce further evidence in the appeal. 19 There was debate before me as to the relevant considerations that may lead to the reception of further evidence by reference to a number of authorities: see for example Orr v Holmes [1948] HCA 16 ; (1948) 76 CLR 632 , at 640-642; Arnotts v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 97 ALR 555 at 612; Greater Wollongong City Council v Cowan [1955] HCA 16 ; (1955) 93 CLR 435 at 444, and generally Murdaca v Accounts Control Management Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 577. 20 Section 27 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Federal Court Act') permits this Court in its discretion to receive further evidence. The exercise of the discretion to receive further evidence must be exercised judicially and consistently with the judicial process.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1968">36 In Murdaca v Accounts Control Management Services Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 577 Stone J, after discussing a number of relevant authorities, said (at [6]) that the evidence "must have sufficient probative value that it is likely to have produced a different result had it been presented at the trial". </sentence>
