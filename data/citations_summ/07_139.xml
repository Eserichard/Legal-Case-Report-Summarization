<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1452">18 A debtor cannot " satisfy " the Court, for example, by showing no more than the fact that a claim is made and how the claim may be made out: Re Duncan, Ex parte Modlin (1917) 17 SR (NSW) 152 per Street J. It is not sufficient that a debtor believes he has a genuine claim; what is required is that the Court must be satisfied that it is just that the claim should be determined before the bankruptcy proceedings are allowed to continue: Dekkan v Evans [2008] FCA 1004 at [54] per Jacobson J. See also: Dekkan v Macquarie Leasing Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1431 per Buchanan J; Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 139. Mere production of a statement of claim, without more, is not sufficient: Re Cox (1934) 7 ABC 98. Nor is a " shadowy " claim that could not fairly be litigated: Re Rivett; Ex parte Edward Fay Ltd (1932) 5 ABC 182 at 188.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 167">3 The petition for a sequestration order was based on the appellant's act of bankruptcy in failing to comply with a bankruptcy notice served on him in respect of the judgement debt. The bankruptcy notice had been served on the appellant on 22 June 2006, and the appellant applied to have it set aside claiming that he had a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand against the respondents that was equal to, or greater than, the amount of the judgment debt. That application was dismissed by Finn J on 16 February 2007; see Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property (formerly known as Citicorp Australia Ltd) [2007] FCA 139. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 561">2 The petition for a sequestration order was based on an active bankruptcy on the part of the respondent in failing to comply with a bankruptcy notice due to be served on him in respect of the costs order. The bankruptcy notice was served on him on 22 June 2006. The respondent applied to set the bankruptcy notice aside on the ground that he had a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand against the applicant that was equal to or greater than the amount of the costs order. That application was dismissed on 16 February 2007: Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Pty Ltd (Formerly known as Citicorp Australia Ltd) [2007] FCA 139.  4 At the commencement of the hearing on 22 March 2007, the respondent by counsel renewed the application for an adjournment of the petition to a date to be fixed. In essence, the adjournment was to enable the respondent to prosecute further proceedings in the Supreme Court action in relation to the costs order. Alternatively, but rather faintly, it was argued that on the material before the Court, the existence of proceedings seeking pre-action discovery, either alone or in conjunction with the claims of the respondent about the possibility of setting aside the costs order, should provide other sufficient reason to dismiss the petition. The applicants, in anticipation of that application, had filed further material showing the general history of the matter. That history is also noted briefly in the reasons for decision of Finn J in Cirillo [2007] FCA 139 , at [3]. The hearing was therefore adjourned to the following day to enable counsel for the respondent to fully consider that additional material advanced on behalf of the applicants. 18 The respondent has not yet commenced any proceedings to set aside the costs order. On his own evidence, he was aware of the sale of Citicorp to Consolidated Press at least by September 2006 if not earlier. Despite that, he did not then bring proceedings to set aside the consent order. In Cirillo [2007] FCA 139 Finn J remarked at [8] that the respondent had "steadfastly refused to entertain the prospect of an application to set aside the costs order. " Only belatedly, on 21 March 2007, did the applicant commence proceedings in the Supreme Court of South Australia for pre-action discovery under r 32 of the Supreme Court Rules to seek an order for the production of further documents to determine whether there was a proper basis for him to commence such proceedings. If, as the form of that application suggests, the respondent presently does not have a sufficient basis to apply to set aside the costs order, he could and should in any event have commenced an action for pre-action discovery much earlier than the present time.</sentence>
