<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 690">It was put that there was controversy about this issue. The respondent pointed to the judgment of Greenwood J in John Holland v CFMEU [2009] FCA 786 ; (2009) 186 IR 408 at [181] where his Honour said: 
 "The quality of the conduct engaged, is hindering and obstructing any person and the second limb engaging the notion of otherwise acting in an improper manner, takes its character from intentional acts of hindrance and obstruction. " 
  Here both parties have made submissions about the decision at first instance of Greenwood J in John Holland Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 786 ; (2009) 186 IR 408. That was a case that turned on whether or not union officials have a valid right of entry onto a work site and, once again, was a s 760 case, not a s 756 case. The significance of this decision lies in Greenwood J's observations about the nature of conduct constituting "acting in an improper manner" and the extent to which such conduct requires intent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 834">Order 3 contemplates, it seems to me, that the primary judge is to give further consideration to those issues identified by the Full Court which were either not addressed in the primary reasons in resolving the questions agreed by the parties for resolution set out at [24] of the reasons for judgment of 24 July 2009 ( John Holland Pty Ltd v [CFMEU] [2009] FCA 786) or were addressed on a footing which having regard to the reasons of Dowsett J (Spender J agreeing) reflect the application of an incorrect test for determining whether contraventions of the sections are made out by the applicant. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 865">These reasons are to be read in conjunction with the reasons for judgment in John Holland Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 786. </sentence>
