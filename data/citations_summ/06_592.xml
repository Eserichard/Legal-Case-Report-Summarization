<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 632">What is illegitimate is a question of fact to be decided in the circumstances of the particular case: Canturi v Sita Coaches Pty Ltd (supra) at 43. Illegitimate pressure including unlawful threats or pressure amount to unconscionable conduct. It can also include unlawful conduct in relevant circumstances: Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authorities (1999) 93 FCR 34 at [367]. The requirement to enter into an AWA does not need to be an issue for duress to arise: Bishop v Ropolo Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 592 ; (2006) 153 FCR 357 at [21] . Neither is it an essential element for a contravention of s.400(5), for the will of the employee to be actually overborne: Granada Tavern v Smith [2008] FCA 646 at 75. </sentence>

Illegitimate pressure may include unlawful threats, unconscionable pressure, and, in relevant circumstances, lawful conduct: Geraldton Port Authority, ALR at 125 per Nicholson J; FCA at 367 per Nicholson J. In order to continue to be employed in the same job at the same place Franklin had to agree to the standard not negotiable terms of the AWA, and was not able to be employed on or negotiate any other form of industrial instrument in relation to that employment. Further, after the probationary period she might be terminated from the job she had been doing if she did not perform. That, and the refusal to negotiate a different industrial instrument and terms and conditions demonstrated, and were an exercise of, the power disparity between Franklin and the Respondents. In the circumstances that constituted the application of duress in relation to her as an employee in connection with an AWA. [79] </sentence>
