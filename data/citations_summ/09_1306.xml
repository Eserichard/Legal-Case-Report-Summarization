<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 479"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 107">Instances can be provided where, in the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 47A(1) , evidence has been permitted to be given by way of video link: eg, Reinsurance Australia Corporation Ltd v HIH Casualty &amp; General Insurance Ltd (in liq) [2002] FCA 1549. In Sheldon &amp; Hammond Pty Ltd v Metrokane Inc [2002] FCA 1561 , Conti J permitted evidence to be given by way of video link where a witness was too ill to travel to Sydney. Instances can also be cited where there has emerged a reason for requiring a witness to attend in court in person. In Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Ltd [2007] FCA 1502 , for example, leave was refused in circumstances where the estimated cross-examination was lengthy. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v StonesOnline International Inc [2009] FCA 717 , leave was also refused where the use of a video link facility was opposed and where there was ( inter alia ) anticipated difficulty in cross-examining by way of video link. Similarly, perhaps, in Campaign Master (UK) Ltd v Forty Two International Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 1306 at [78] , [2009] FCA [2009] FCA 1306 ; 1306 ; 181 FCR 152 at 171 Buchanan J stated that he did " not share the view expressed by Katz J ". </sentence>
