<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] VSC 504">52 For the reasons set out in paragraphs 49 to 51 of this judgment, Cornall and cases that ha [21] applied its reasoning21 can be distinguished. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 987">127 In any event, the question of whether a party has been denied procedural fairness must be assessed by reference to the whole process ( Phan v Kelly [2007] FCA 269 ; (2007) 158 FCR 75) ( Phan ). The evidence discloses that Dr Saint had legal representation at the hearing before the Committee, that he was provided with a draft report by the Committee which clearly identified the issues in respect of which he was at risk of an adverse finding and that he made very extensive submissions in response to the draft report. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 984">
 

66 As I understand Dr Carrick's submissions concerning the sampling methodology adopted by the Committee, she does not contend that the Committee breached any express requirement of the Determination. Rather she argues that it is necessarily implicit in the Determination that the Committee was required:
 
 'to find for itself and inspect a fresh pool of randomly selected medical services to examine, instead of examining a set of 30 from the 40 provided to them by the Director. ' 
 

Again, as I understand it, this is a re-run of an argument unsuccessfully advanced before Tamberlin J in Phan [2007] FCA 269.  79 The second error claimed to affect the methodology adopted by the Committee was that the preliminary random sample was not a random sample in the hands of the Committee because it had already been the subject of consideration by the Director. This argument was rejected by Tamberlin J in Phan [2007] FCA 269 at [52] . His Honour there observed:
 
 'In my view, the sample used in the present case was in accordance with the requirements of the Act. The evidence is that the Commission drew a preliminary random sample and that the Director required the production of records which he examined. 
 
 

47 Appendix 2 to the Adjudicative Referral was a list of the first 40 randomly selected MBS item 30487 services (and the full medical records for the patients identified in that list) from the list of randomly selected MBS item 30487 services provided to the Director by the Commission. Dr Carrick's outline opening statement indicated that her case concerning the Adjudicative Referral was that the discretion of the Director to refer the matter to a Committee hearing miscarried because he included in his referral 'the already examined patient medical files of [Dr Carrick] for the Committee for it to examine again' (emphasis in original). This appears to be a re-run of an argument unsuccessfully advanced before Tamberlin J in Phan v Kelly [2007] FCA 269.
