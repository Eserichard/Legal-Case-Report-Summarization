<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1327">25 Section 191(2) and s 193(2) and reg 9 impose requirements as to the giving notice of the Scheme and other procedural matters. On 22 June 2007 dispensation with certain requirements was granted pursuant to s 191(5) of the Act ( Re MetLife Insurance Limited and Challenger Life No. 2 Limited [2007] FCA 937). I was carefully taken through the evidence by senior counsel for each of the applicants and was satisfied that there had been compliance with all requirements. The only debatable issue concerned typographical errors in the Scheme's summary. I was also satisfied that the Scheme complies with s 190(3) and that there was no issue with the mechanics of it.
