<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 383">It has formerly been concluded that the letter dated 16 November 2006 from Mr Rickus' legal advisers is, without more, a letter confined in its terms to the provision of legal advice and that it did not extend to an agreement in itself as to the fees payable in respect of the subsequent litigation: [2009] FCA 1221.  Why the Court should now have any greater confidence that the resolution of these further issues will assist in the resolution of the outstanding dispute may be doubted. The inability of the parties to sensibly resolve their dispute without the intervention of this Court has previously been the subject of criticism: [2009] FCA 1221 at [3] .  The position now agreed between the parties, however, was that the following table sets forth the amount of legal costs involved and the date upon which those moneys were claimed and paid:
 TAX INVOICE DATE TOTAL AMT PAYMENTS/DATE 14062 31/10/2007 $50,301.78 07/01/2008 --- $34,288.09 22/09/2008 --- $620.00 10/12/2008 --- $8,909.00 14283 29/11/2007 $64,901.16 22/09/2008 --- $18,000.00 02/12/2008 --- $15,000.00 10/12/2008 --- $3,784.00 14477 21/12/2007 $16,616.14 10/12/2008 --- $4,807.00 TOTAL 
 $131,819.08 $85,408.09 
 
The costs incurred in the hearing and resolution of the current Notice of Motion --- it may safely be assumed --- far outstrip the quantum of the amount dividing the parties. That amount, if calculated by reference to the Federal Court scale of fees, is approximately $55,000 to $60,000: [2009] FCA 1221 at [10] .  That Notice of Motion came on for hearing on 28 October 2009. On that occasion the course pursued was to resolve only a question as to the ambit of a Letter of Retainer dated 16 November 2006. That was a letter sent to Mr Rickus by the legal advisers he had retained in South Australia. It was anticipated by the parties that the resolution of that discrete question would considerably assist the complete resolution of the outstanding dispute as to costs. That question was resolved: Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Rickus (No 5) [2009] FCA 1221. Rejected was a submission made on behalf of Mr Rickus that the letter on its terms extended beyond the mere provision of advice and extended to the terms upon which the subsequent litigation was conducted. </sentence>
