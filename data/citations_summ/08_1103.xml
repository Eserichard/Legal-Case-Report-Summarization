<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 61">27 The other decisions on which Ascot Four relied (cited at [30] of the Full Court's decision in Prouds Jewellers [2008] FCAFC 199 and at [15] above) do not lead to any conclusion contrary to that reached by the primary judge on the facts of the present case. None of the decisions tested the extent of the potential representation conveyed by dual pricing because none involved facts where the strike through price had been the ticketed or offer price. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Carrerabenz Diamond Industries Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1103 involved a plea of guilty in circumstances where it was admitted that the items had never been offered for sale at the strike through price. Nevertheless, the plea of guilty was to each allegation including that "each advertisement would have led [the consumer] to believe that if they purchased the diamond in question in each instance, that they would obtain a substantial saving, which amounted to the difference between those two prices" (at [6]). Trade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd and Cue &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1996) 85 A Crim R 500 also involved guilty pleas in circumstances where the items had never been offered for sale at the higher price. Again, the same situation (that is, no previous offer for sale at the higher price) existed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) v Terania Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 732. Ducret v Chaudhary's Oriental Carpet Palace Pty Ltd (1987) 16 FCR 562 also did not call for determination of the question whether the representation extended beyond a mere offer, albeit for different reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 28">36 Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Carrerabenz Diamond Industries Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1103 concerned six counts of contraventions of s 75AZC(1)(g) of the TP Act by six separate newspaper advertisements in a daily newspaper circulating in Melbourne, Sydney (2), Perth (2) and Adelaide. Those advertisements offered in all 25 items of diamond jewellery at a "usual mark . price"" and a "crazy price".</sentence>
