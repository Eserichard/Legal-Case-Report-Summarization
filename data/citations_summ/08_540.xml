<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 796">In setting forth matters that the Court " may take into account " when considering an application for security for costs, Rule 3 does not attempt either to provide an exhaustive statement of the factors that may be taken into account or to fetter the broad and unfettered discretionary power otherwise conferred by s 56: Tan Kah Hock v AWAP SGT 26 Investment Ltd [2008] FCA 540 at [3] to [4] per Gilmour J. </sentence>

 To make or refuse to make an order for security for costs involves the exercise of a discretionary judgment. That means that the court exercising the discretion must weigh all the circumstances of the case. The weight to be given to any circumstance depends not only upon its own intrinsic persuasiveness but upon the impact of the other circumstances which have to be weighed. A circumstance which may have very great weight when only two or three circumstances have to be weighed may be of minor significance when many circumstances have to be weighed. However, for over 200 years, the fact that a party, bringing proceedings, is resident out of the jurisdiction and has no assets within the jurisdiction has been seen as a circumstance of great weight in determining whether an order for security for costs should be made. Indeed, for many years the practice has been to order such a party to provide security for costs unless that party can point to other circumstances which overcome the weight of the circumstance that that person is resident out of and has no assets within the jurisdiction.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1542">13 BAT relies upon the broad unfettered discretion conferred upon the Court by s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to order an applicant to give security for the payment of costs that may be awarded against that party. The jurisdiction is not delimited by Order 28, r 3 ( Bell Wholesale Co. Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (No. 2) [1984] FCA 34 ; (1984) 2 FCR 1 ; Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 496 ; James v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (No. 1) (1985) 9 FCR 442). In exercising the discretion under s 56 , the practice in Australia for a very long time has been that a party who is not ordinarily resident in this country and has no assets within the jurisdiction, is normally ordered to give security for costs. These two factors are regarded as circumstances of "great weight" in determining whether such an order should be made ( Chellaram &amp; Co. Ltd v China Ocean Shipping Co. (1991) 102 ALR 321; (1991) 65 ALJR 642). The qualification upon the weight to be attributed to these factors was put by McHugh J in Chellaram at p 323 (ALR) and at p 643 (ALJR) in these terms, "... unless that party can point to other circumstances which overcome the weight of the circumstance that that person is resident out of and has no assets within the jurisdiction". These well established principles have been applied more recently in Logue v Hansen Technologies Ltd [2003] FCA 81 ; (2003) 125 FCR 590 at [38] and [39]; Tan Kah Hock v AWAP SGT 26 Investment Ltd [2008] FCA 540 [7] and [8]; Cheng XI Shipyard v The Ship "Falcon Trident" [2006] FCA 759 at [9] . </sentence>
