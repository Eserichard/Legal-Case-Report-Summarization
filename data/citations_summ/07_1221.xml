 68 Recently in this country, the principle was affirmed by Finkelstein J in Ox Operations Pty Ltd v Landmark Property Developments (Vic) Pty Ltd in liquidation: [31] 
 
 
 The usual course when a company is improperly made a plaintiff is to stay or dismiss the action and require the solicitor who purported to act for the company to pay the cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 284">Deterrence is an important factor. This is also acknowledged by the respondent. The respondent says: [20] In any event, there is significant deterrence in the bringing of the proceeding which has cost the Respondents time and money: see Ponzio v B&amp;P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (2007) FCA 1221 at [25] , [31], [34] and [35]; Ponzio v B&amp;P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 at [138] and [164] per Jessup J but see F Lander J at [102]; Pine v Expoconti Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1434 Kenny J at [15]-[16]; Pine v Casello Constructions Pty Ltd (2005) FCA North J at [9]; Ponzio v D&amp;E Airconditioning Pty Ltd (2005) FCA 964 North J at [20], [29] and [30]; Furlong v Maxim Electrical Services (Aust) Pty Ltd (No. 3) (2006) FCA 1705 Marshall J at [20]. ... [22] Further, the achievement of a negotiated outcome at an early stage in this case, is an advantage to the regulator, the Australian Building Construction Commission. It has the effect of releasing resources that may have otherwise have been devoted to this matter and allowing those resources to be used in pursuit of other suspected contraveners which, in turn, increases deterrence. (see Mobil at [55]. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 265">(above) will serve a deterrent purpose. 18. There is significant deterrence in the bringing of the proceeding itself: See Ponzio ---v- B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd &amp; Others [2007] FCA 1221 at [25] , [31], [34] and [35]; Ponzio ---v- B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd &amp; Others [2007] FCAFC 65 at [138] and [164] per Jessup J; Pine v Expoconti Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1434 Kenny J at [15] --- [16]; Pine v Casello Constructions Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1854 North J at [9]; Ponzio v D and E Air Conditioning Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 964 North J at [20], [29] and 30]; Furlong v Maxim Electrical Services (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1705 Marshall J at [20]. 19. Further, the achievement of a negotiated outcome at an early stage in this case, is an advantage to the regulator, the Australian Building Construction Commission.</sentence>
