<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] QSC 233">Accordingly, it was argued that the present case is distinguishable from O'Connor. [43] The applicant also sought to draw on similar judicial attitudes to those outlined already in the area of sham contractual documents in contract law. The courts have long recognised a preparedness to look behind contractual documents which parties do not intend to effect their legal relations but rather are used as a sham: see also Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallen Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; Raftland Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 109. In Pickersgill and Harvey v Tsoukalas [2009] SASC 357 White J, with whom Anderson J agreed, summarised the contractual principles as follows: 
 
 "[35] The conventional contractual principle is that, absent some vitiating element such as misrepresentation, duress or mistake, or a claim for equitable or statutory relief, a person signing a document which is intended to effect legal relations is bound by its terms. A second principle is that ordinarily direct statements by contracting parties of their subjective intentions are inadmissible to contradict the language of the written contract.</sentence>
