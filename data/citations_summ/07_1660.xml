<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1305">32 It is no coincidence that this proceeding, with additional Respondents, including Mr Whittle, who had not hitherto featured in Mr Rogers' litigation, came to be instituted after de Jersey CJ made his orders and on the same day that Collier J dismissed an application brought on 14 June 2007 by Mrs Rogers against those who are the present First to Seventh Respondents: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1660 , 1 November 2007. I note that, in those proceedings (at [38] &amp; [39]), Collier J reached a like conclusion in relation to circumvention when ordering the removal from that file of affidavits sworn by Mr and Mrs Rogers respectively. If nothing else, for like reasons, a like fate in these proceedings should be visited on Mr Rogers' affidavit of 1 November 2007 pursuant to O 14 r 8 of the Federal Court Rules . Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 1371. 01.11.07 Justice Collier dismissed proceeding QUD173/2007, with costs. Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 1660. 08.11.07 Mrs Rogers commenced proceeding QUD375/2007 against the First to Seventh Respondents in which she seeks leave to appeal against the decision of Justice Collier in QUD173/2007.  8 By coincidence, in the ordinary operation of this Court's docket system, it has fallen to me (in QUD375/2007) to decide whether to grant to Mrs Rogers leave to appeal in respect of some of her litigation namely, proceeding QUD173/2007, Rogers v Asset Loan Pty Ltd and Ors [2007] FCA 1660 , 1 November 2007, Collier J. There was no objection made to my having each matter. Nonetheless, I have expressly considered whether, in light of that coincidence and the conclusion reached by me in the preceding paragraph, I ought not to hear one of the applications made with respect to Mr and Mrs Rogers' respective proceedings with the other being transferred to another judge to hear and determine. In my opinion, the rules of natural justice do not require that course to be taken. </sentence>
