<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 510">The legal principles with respect to the disqualification of a Federal Magistrate for apprehended bias are firmly established and may be summarised as follows: the test is whether a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the Federal Magistrate might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question required to be decided; [96] the application of the test requires two steps: the identification of what it is said might lead a Federal Magistrate to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits; and an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits; [97] the fair minded lay observer is a person who is: informed, objective, and taken to be reasonable; [98] not assumed to have a detailed knowledge of the law or the character or ability of a particular Federal Magistrate, but rather a general knowledge of ordinary judicial practice and the actual circumstances of the case; [99] the Federal Magistrate being observed is a professional judicial officer who by training, tradition and oath or affirmation is required to discard the irrelevant, immaterial and prejudicial; [100] a Federal Magistrate's duty is to hear and determine the litigation before the Court, and not to accede too readily to suggestions of an apprehension of bias, lest parties be encouraged to seek such disqualification without justification; [101] disqualification is only made out by firmly establishing that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias by reason of prejudgment, that is that the Federal Magistrate's mind is so prejudiced in favour of a conclusion already formed that it is not susceptible to alteration of that conclusion irrespective of the evidence or arguments presented; [102] and comments made by a federal magistrate must be considered in the context in which they are made, including the context of: ordinary judicial practice; the exigencies of modern litigation.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 73">90 During the course of the hearing, Ms Luck asked that we stay the proceedings pending her filing an application for removal into the High Court. She told us that the application for removal proposed to challenge the refusals of Graham J and Rares J to disqualify themselves for the reasons that they gave separately on 7 May 2008: Luck v University of Southern Queensland [2009] FCA 479 and [2009] FCA 521. The Full Court refused that stay. It was not appropriate to interrupt the business of the Court in that way.
  95 I have already found that the primary judge did not err in rejecting the allegations of bias which Ms Luck put to him. Subsequently, she sought to raise before us further allegations of bias against his Honour. Another Full Court constituted by Moore, Lindgren and Bennett JJ rejected those same allegations in Luck [2009] FCAFC 54 at [82] - [83]. Ms Luck had relied on the new allegations to establish a claim that his Honour was biased in her attempt to appeal from the decisions the primary judge had made in proceedings VID 488 of 2008. Ms Luck's new allegations were that the primary judge first, had undertaken work when counsel for the Australian Government and, secondly, had been appointed in December 2008 as President of the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal. Moore, Lindgren and Bennett JJ found that a reasonable and informed lay person would not think that these new allegations taken individually or cumulatively would render his Honour to be predisposed to decide in favour of the respondent and against Ms Luck in the primary proceeding. I agree with their Honours' conclusion that these new allegations should also be rejected in these proceedings, because no fair minded and informed lay person might reasonably apprehend having regard to any of those matters, separately or collectively, that the primary judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of Ms Luck's matter: Ebner 205 CLR at 334 [16] and see too: Luck [2009] FCA 479 at [10] per Graham J and [2009] FCA 521 at [5] - [6] at [18]-[20] per myself (see too [81]-[82] above).
