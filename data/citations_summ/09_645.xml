<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 751">These provisions were carried over into the current legislation by Division 3 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW). Section 77 confers a right of entry in the terms quoted in the above agreed statement of facts on a defined group of union officials, who must hold instruments of authority issued under the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) (see John Holland Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (New South Wales Branch) [2009] FCA 645 ; (2009) 178 FCR 461 at [18] - [27]). When exercising the right, the authorised union official is obliged to present evidence of his or her State authority only "if required to do so by the occupier" (see s.79). The right of entry may be exercised without formal or informal notice being given to anyone before entry. The authorised official is not required to explain or justify his or her entry to anyone, before being allowed to enter or remain on site. Informal notice of the official's presence on site after entry is usually required "as soon as reasonably practicable" , but is not required where this would defeat the purpose of the investigation, or cause unreasonable delay, or where the occupier is aware of the entry (see s.78). The official has powers to make searches and inspections, take photographs and recordings, require assistance, and require production of documents concerning OH&amp;S matters (see s.81). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 771">In advancing the submission that Messrs Hanlon, Kera and Mitchell did not have a " right of entry ", Counsel on behalf of the Respondents relied upon the decision in John Holland Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (New South Wales Branch) [2009] FCA 645 , 178 FCR 461 (" John Holland "). In that decision, Moore J concluded that a person who was not an " officer " as then defined in the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) was not an " authorised representative " for the purposes of s 76 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) and had no right to enter a work site. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AIRC 868"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 269">In a very recent decision of the Federal Court, Moore J faced a not completely dissimilar fact situation to that which is before this Court. In John Holland Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union , [90] members of the respondent union sought to enter the site of the construction of Sydney's desalination treatment plant at Kurnell. His Honour made findings of fact that the union first contacted the Group General Manager (Human Resources) of the applicant company with a view to arranging to go to the site to "check it out. " His Honour also found that the union was advised to contact the "People and Capabilities Manager," a Ms Friedlander, at the site regarding protocols for entry, and that the union did so. She "requested details about the safety breach the second respondent had raised. " [91] It would appear that no objection was taken to such a straight-forward inquiry.
