<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] SADC 93">It was accepted before me that the learned Master identified the appropriate test to be applied. The learned Master identified case law to the effect that the mere fact that a corporate plaintiff has a minimal paid-up capital and acts as a trustee company is sufficient to constitute "credible evidence". Reference was then made by the learned Master to Olivaylle Pty Ltd v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA [5] where Finn J referred (with approval) at paragraph 12 to an earlier decision of the Federal Court where Heery J had said: 
 
 Today's companies with very small paid-up capital may be solvent and prosperous while others with balance sheets showing impressive sums in this regard may have no more than wistful memories of past glories to show creditors. [6]

 Miscellaneous Appeal 
 
 
 ANDERSON J. 
 Introduction 
 This is an appeal from a decision of a master who refused an application by the second defendant Baulderstone Hornibrook Pty Ltd ("Baulderstone") for an order for security for costs. Mr Dal Cin submitted that even if the assets were to be given their auction value, consideration should be given to the value of the respondent's enterprise as a going concern. Mr Dal Cin referred to the decision of Quinn J in Olivaylle Pty Ltd v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co [2007] FCA 56 in which the applicant had refused to provide evidence of its ability to pay an adverse costs order. Quinn J found that there is no onus on the applicant to adduce such evidence and he emphasised that the court has a wide discretion to grant security. Quinn J took into account the fact that the applicant seemed to have a substantial business and that there was no evidence to suggest it would be unable to pay its debts, in deciding not to make an order for security for costs against it. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 571">The then docket judge had made directions on 27 July 2007 which required Olivaylle to file its material on or before 7 September 2007. Flottweg had made earlier that year one unsuccessful application for security for costs: Olivaylle Pty Ltd (ACN 080 670 640) v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA (ABN 95 101 547 424) [2007] FCA 56 (It was shortly to make another: Olivaylle Pty Ltd (ACN 080 670 640) v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA (ABN 95 101 547 424) (No 2) [2007] FCA 1892 , heard 14 September 2007). Olivaylle had the benefit of a costs order in its favour from the earlier application. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1892">1 This is the second application that has been made by the respondent, Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA, for security for costs in this matter. In February of this year I dismissed the first application: see Olivaylle Pty Ltd (ACN 080 670 640) v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA (ABN 95 101 547 424) [2007] FCA 56. I incorporate by reference those reasons into the present ones. It is unnecessary for present purposes that I reiterate the background facts referred to on the first application as also the statement of applicable principles which are not now in controversy. The only additional matter to which I would make reference is that in addition to relying upon s 1335 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) the respondent also invokes the court's jurisdiction to order security under s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). </sentence>
