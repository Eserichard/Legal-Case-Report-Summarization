<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] ATMO 20">The opponent's trade mark REBELLION is wholly contained within the applicant's trade mark. There are numerous Federal Court cases and decisions from the Registrar's delegates where deceptive similarity has been considered with respect to the applicant's trade mark containing the whole of the opponent's trade mark. Some examples where deceptively similarity has been found include ERA and NEW ERA [5] , JEST and EASYJEST [6] , PARKER KNOLL and KNOLL [7] , PACE and OLIN PACE [8] , BRATS and BONZA BRATS, [9] and more recently NEXT and NEXT GENERATION [10] . It is, however, equally clear that despite a common element between the two trade marks, where a trade mark conveys a different idea or concept, deceptive similarity may not result (such as in HEALTH PLUS and INNER HEALTH PLUS [11] or BULL and BULL TRADER [12] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] ATMO 3">The parties disagreed as to whether section 60, which was amended by the Trade Marks Amendment Act 2006 , applied to this opposition in its amended or unamended form [6] . I need not enter into that debate as it has no influence on my reasoning in this case. The establishment of both section 60 and section 42(b) has a common dependency upon proof of reputation in the Opponent's trade mark in Australia before 22 November 2005. Accordingly I first examine the Opponent's claim to reputation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1380">The respondents submitted that the relevant date was the same as for passing-off, namely the date of commencement of the impugned conduct: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Pty Ltd (1980) 32 ALR 387 at 397; Thai World Import &amp; Export Co Ltd v Shuey Shing Pty Ltd (1989) 17 IPR 289 at 302-303; Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd (2008) 75 IPR 478 ; [2008] FCA 100 at [76] ; Sydney Markets Ltd v Sydney Flower Market Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 124 at [103] ; Anheuser-Busch Inc v Budejovicky Budvar (2002) 56 IPR 182 ; [2002] FCA 390 at [237] ; Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd v Q &amp; Q Global Enterprise (2003) 61 IPR 98 ; [2003] FCA 1404 at [124] ; Hansen Beverage Co v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd (2008) 75 IPR 505 ; [2008] FCA 406 at [52] ; Nature's Blend Pty Ltd v Nestle Australia Ltd (2010) 86 IPR 1 ; [2010] FCA 198 at [12] - [13]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] ATMO 119">The opponent submitted that when an applicant has been put on notice that intention is in issue, the onus of establishing its intention to use the trade mark shifts to the holder. Justice Jacobson, in Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd and Others [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 stated: 
However, there is authority for the proposition that where an applicant for registration has been put on notice that its intention to use the mark was in issue, and has not responded to the opponent's evidence, a finding of lack of intention may be made: Philip Morris Products SA v Sean Ngu [2002] ATMO 96 ; Tommy Hilfiger Licensing Inc v Tan (2002) 60 IPR 137 ; Shanahan at [11.110]. The principle which underlies these authorities seems to me to be that the evidentiary onus shifts to the applicant for registration where an opponent makes a prima facie case of lack of intention to use the mark. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1293">As to the matter pleaded in para 68 of the Defence, this relies upon: 
(1) The general discretion that the Court has not to grant relief under s 88 notwithstanding that a ground is otherwise made out ('a prescribed court may'), and see Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 at [204] to [205], and the authorities there cited; and
 
(2) the discretion that the court has under s 89(l)(b) and (c) not to grant relief under s 88 even if (contrary to Spirits' case), the grounds pleaded in paras 56(b), 57(b), 58 to 59 of the FACC were otherwise made out, on the basis that Spirits satisfies the Court that the ground relied upon by FKP 'has not arisen through any act or fault of the registered owner'. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] ATMO 93">However, the emphasis and timing relevant to paragraph 92(4)(a), the ground for removal at issue here, is quite different. The opponent bears the onus of demonstrating either that it had an intention at the time of filing to use the trade mark on the goods specified, or that it has used the trade mark in good faith in the period up to one month prior to the date the removal application was filed. A removal application based on this ground may be made at any time after a trade mark application is filed. Its unpopularity with removal applicants is testament to their quite limited prospects for success under it, should the application be opposed. [6] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 638">In Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 (" Health World "), Jacobson J at first instance considered the s 59 ground of opposition in the context of an application for rectification. His Honour stated (at [158]): 
 
 
 In order to make good the s 59 ground in its application for rectification under s 88(2)(a), Health World must establish that, as at 7 May 2001, Shin-Sun did not intend to use or authorise the use of the HEALTH PLUS trade mark in Australia: see s 59(a). 
 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCAFC 58">
 

38 The concerns specific to opposition under s 59 of the Act do not readily translate to s 58 of the Act. In Health World , a case concerned with opposition under s 59 of the Act, Jacobson J said at [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 at [161] - [163]:
 
 
 [161] The subjective nature of the intention, the presumption of intention flowing from the application for registration and the onus on an opponent usually make it difficult for an opposition, or an application for rectification, to succeed on this ground: see Shanahan at [2.120], [11.110]; A Dufty and J Lahore, Lahore, Patents Trade Marks and Related Rights , LexisNexis Butterworths, Sydney, 2006 at [55,580]. 
 
 
 
 [162] However, there is authority for the proposition that where an applicant for registration has been put on notice that its intention to use the mark was in issue, and has not responded to the opponent's evidence, a finding of lack of intention may be made: Philip Morris Products SA v Sean Ngu [2002] ATMO 96 ; Tommy Hilfiger Licensing Inc v Tan (2002) 60 IPR 137 ; Shanahan at [11.110]. 
 
 
 
 [163] The principle which underlies these authorities seems to me to be that the evidentiary onus shifts to the applicant for registration where an opponent makes a prima facie case of lack of intention to use the mark. 37 We turn to consider Television's alternative argument in relation to the shifting onus of proof in relation to the grounds of opposition in ss 58 and 59 of the Act. The judge below recognised that there are no cases concerning s 58 in which the onus has been held to shift, in any way, to the applicants: Her Honour said:
 
 
 [34] The principle that the evidentiary onus in relation to ownership shifts in the circumstances submitted by the applicant has previously been promulgated in the context of opposition to a trade mark on the basis of s 59 ( Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 at [163] ) but not, so far as I am aware, s 58. 72 As has been noted, the filing of an application for registration of a mark is prima facie evidence of an intention to use that mark. Once an opponent has made out a prima facie case that there was a lack of intention to use a mark, it has been held that the onus shifts to the applicant to establish that intention ( Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478). </sentence>

In the present matter, in contrast, there is no scope for such debate or for any consequent misapprehension.

 Aggrieved person 
 
 In order for s 88(1) to be enlivened, so as to enable Health World to invoke the grounds of opposition under ss 42 , 59 and 60 , Health World must be an aggrieved person. The expression "an aggrieved person" is to be given a wide interpretation: see In the Matter of Powell's Trade Mark (1893) 10 RPC 195 at 201 (CA UK); (1894) 11 RPC 4 at 7---8 (HL); see also Continental Liqueurs Pty Ltd v G F Heublein &amp; Bro Inc [1960] HCA 37 ; (1960) 103 CLR 422 at 427. An aggrieved person is one who has a real interest in having a trade mark removed from the register, or one who would be appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense if the trade mark remained on the register: Continental Liqueurs at 427; Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 at 193---4 ; 95 FLR 418 at 451; 88 ALR 217 at 254; 12 IPR 417 at 454; Kraft Foods Inc v Gaines Pet Foods Corporation (1996) 65 FCR 104 at 112---13; 136 ALR 68 at 77; 34 IPR 198 at 207. It is not sufficient that an applicant for rectification of the register is in the same trade as the registered owner of the mark; what is required is that the applicant have a desire to use the mark, or be likely to be hampered in some other way by the registration of the mark that the applicant seeks to have expunged: Shanahan at [14.90]. I do not consider that Health World has any genuine desire to use the HEALTH PLUS mark. It is true that Health World has filed an application No 1121282 for the series trade mark HEALTH PLUS including a number of variations. That application was filed on 28 June 2006, approximately 6 months after Health World commenced the rectification proceeding, and 3 days after it commenced the Health World non-use proceeding.

S 60 was amended by the Trade Marks Amendment Act 2006 (Cth) with effect from the date of Royal Assent to that Act, which was 23 October 2006 . While that Act specified that the amendments to ss 62, 58A and 61 would apply to applications filed but not yet accepted at the date of Royal Assent, it was silent as to whether the amendments to s 60 would also apply to applications which had been filed but had not yet been accepted at that date. It has been well established that where an application was filed and accepted before 23 October 2006, s 60 applies in the form as it stood before that amendment. [17] 
 
It seems also that the practice of the Office is to apply s 60 in its unamended form to applications which were filed before 23 October 2006, regardless of whether or not they had been accepted by that date.

A major point of comparison was with the additional word in the trade mark creating a different overall meaning: 
"...The two marks convey different ideas and concepts. Healthplus conveys, to the ordinary person, an impression of enhanced health and well-being. It is directed at the idea of overall or general health. It is not concerned with specific aspects of bodily health such as internal health. " [Jacobsen J, at 136]
 
The same cannot be said for the two trade marks under comparison here. The essential meaning of "Sleep Well" has not altered due to the addition of the word "Snooze" in fancy script in the applicant's trade mark. </sentence>

"Use" in relation to goods is relevantly defined as "use of the trade mark upon, or in physical or other relation to, the goods (including second hand goods)". The grant of a licence to use a trade mark, in the absence of the control required by s 8, will result in use by the licensee that does not enure for the benefit of the owner under s 7(3). The relevant connection between the owner and the trade would be severed in such a case, consistent with the common understanding of the old law, that to grant a licence to use a trade mark invalidated it but if the licensee sold or advertised goods under the trade mark, there would undoubtedly be trade mark use: Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478. </sentence>

This is a hearing de novo and the parties have adduced evidence in this hearing directed to the exercise of discretion.

The evidence with respect to post-relevant period convergence and potential for confusion has simply validated that prediction. The facts relevant to the exercise of the discretion
  The expression "person aggrieved" has been discussed in Kraft Foods Inc v Gaines Pet Foods Corporation (1996) 65 FCR 104 by Sackville J (with whom Sheppard and Tamberlin JJ agreed) and by Jacobson J in Health World Ltd (ABN 73 010 636 165) v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 060 792 163) [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 .

 The power to order rectification under s 88 is expressed in discretionary terms. However, in EOS Australia Pty Ltd v Expo Tomei Pty Ltd (1998) 42 IPR 277 at 287, Branson J expressed the view that the terms of s 89 suggest that s 88(1) does not vest a true discretion in the court. In my opinion, there is force in Branson J's view because s 88(1) is subject to s 89, and s 89 confers a discretion, to be exercised in limited circumstances, not to grant an application for rectification. Nevertheless, this approach has not been taken in other courts: see, for example, Toddler Kindy Gymbaroo Pty Ltd v Gymbaree Pty Ltd (2000) 100 FCR 166 ; 51 IPR 1 ; [2000] FCA 618 at [97] ; Mayne Industries Pty Ltd v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Ltd (2008) 75 IPR 102 ; [2008] FCA 27 at [75] . Lahore observes at [57,155] that s 89 may be seen as codifying the case law on blameworthy conduct; accordingly, it deals with the circumstances in which a particular discretion may be exercised without detracting from the general discretion found in s 88(1). I propose to proceed on that basis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2008] FCA 1415">10 As to intention to use:
 
(1) The required intention is "a real and definite intention to use the mark publicly in Australia as a trade mark, although not necessarily immediately or within any limited time" ( Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 at 203E --- F). The required intention has been described as "a resolve or settled purpose" to use the mark ( In Re Ducker's Trade Mark [1929] 1 Ch 113 at 121) as distinct from "a mere general intention of extending ... [a] business at some future time to anything...desirable" ( In Re the Registered Trade-Marks of John Batt &amp; Co [1898] 2 Ch 432 at 439 --- 440). (2) The ground of lack of intention is difficult to establish because it depends on proof of the state of mind of the person seeking registration and the act of applying is itself evidence of the requisite intention. However, if an opponent makes a prima facie case of lack of intention to use the trade mark, failure to rebut that evidence may be relevant to establishing this ground ( Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd (2008) 75 IPR 478 ; [2008] FCA 100 at [160] --- [174]).
  4 The opponent claimed that the trade mark application ought to have been rejected under ss 42(b) , 44 , 59 and 60 of the Act (the opponent's notice of appeal also referred to s 58 , but no submissions were put with respect to that ground). Because the trade mark application has a priority date of 15 November 2005 (ss 6(1) and 12 of the Act) the statutory provisions as in force at that date are relevant ( Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd (2008) 75 IPR 478 ; [2008] FCA 100 at [31] )).  48 These conclusions with respect to ss 44 and 60 of the Act mean that I also accept the opponent's objection based on s 42(b) (use of the trade mark would be contrary to law). I accept that use of the respondent's trade mark would be likely to mislead and deceive consumers in relation to the supply of the nominated goods; the circumstances described above mean that some consumers confronted by the "HUGGIE" MUMMY mark in the course of the respondent's authorised use will be likely to identify the opponent as the source of the goods or think that there is an affiliation between the opponent and the respondent's services. By reason of s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) this is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of s 42(b) of the Act ( Health World (2008) 75 IPR 478 ; [2008] FCA 100 at [156] ). </sentence>

The registered proprietor of the mark had died in 1972 and no steps had been taken to transfer the mark until 1997. The beneficial interest in the mark had at all times resided directly or indirectly in members of the Henschke family. The only " formal " deception which could be pointed to was an impression that it may have been the partnership, rather than the executors, who owned the " Hill of Grace " trade mark.
