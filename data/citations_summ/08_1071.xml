<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] QSC 342">[1] CVC and Glennington also rely on representations alleged to have been made on behalf of Suncorp to persons representing, among others, Glennington, that investment properties were quarantined from, and not cross-collateralised with, development funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1915">39 There is no general rule that parties having knowledge of a prior contract between different parties may not subsequently enter into a contract with fundamentally inconsistent terms. As I explained in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 4) [2008] FCA 1071 at [98] - [100], the lack of any such rule is the inevitable consequence of the efficient breach theory of contract, which, although it has occasionally been criticised, remains the controlling theory of contract damages under Australian law: Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd [2001] FCA 1040 ; (2001) 110 FCR 157 at [159] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1700">This was less than the amount claimed by AVS to be secured by the second mortgage: it claimed it was owed in excess of $14 million. In those circumstances it was ordered that the balance be paid into an interest bearing account in the name of the receivers pending the determination of what was due to AVS: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 3) [2008] FCA 448 ; (2008) 246 ALR 580 . On the taking of accounts it was established that the principal due to AVS was $4,100,282.64 and that interest calculated to 17 March 2008 (the day the money was paid into the receivers' account) was $1,573,613.32: Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 4) [2008] FCA 1071 . Those amounts were paid to AVS on 22 September 2008. The question in issue is whether AVS is also entitled to interest on its debt from 17 March 2008 to 22 September 2008 either at the rate specified in the mortgage (14.71 per cent per annum) or at the rate accruing on the deposit.</sentence>
