<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 730">5 In Bailey v Veda Advantage Information Services and Solutions Limited [2007] FCA 1664 (the Earlier Reasons), I described the general nature of the nine proceedings as follows (at [3]-[6]):
 3 All nine are brought by individuals on behalf of themselves and others whose complaints concern information provided by Veda to credit providers relating to the creditworthiness of the applicants and of the group members they respectively represent. Veda is a credit reporting agency, that is to say, it is a corporation that carries on a credit reporting business (I am using expressions taken from the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), ss 6 and 11A ). 4 Credit providers subscribe to Veda in order to have the benefit of information related to the creditworthiness of individuals who apply to them for credit.</sentence>
