 [28] In his affidavit, Mr Langford states that he is a qualified anthropologist and has been employed by Central Desert Native Title Services since 3 July 2008, working primarily in the area covered by the Wiluna native title claim. Whilst the Tribunal is not a court and is not bound by the rules of evidence, the Federal Court's observations about the role anthropological evidence plays in native title cases are of assistance in this matter and support the Tribunal's acceptance of such evidence. The Federal Court has found that expert anthropological evidence of traditional laws and customs and connection to country based on field work, which accords with the member of the native title claim group's evidence, is probative: Neowarra v Western Australia [2003] FCA 1402 at [388] ; Rubibi Community v Western Australia [2005] FCA 1025 at [263] ; Jango and Others v Northern Territory and Others (2006) 152 FCR 150 ; [2006] FCA 318 at [291] - [292]. [29] As the Full Court of the Federal Court has noted, an anthropologist such as Mr Langford may observe and record matters relevant to both the social organisation of a native title claim group and the nature and content of their traditional laws and traditional customs. There may also be circumstances in which an anthropologist may give evidence about the meaning and significance of what Aboriginal witnesses say and do so as to explain or render coherent matters which, on their face, may be incomplete or unclear: Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakaya Native Title Claim Group and Another (2005) 145 FCR 442 ; (2005) 220 ALR 431 ; [2005] FCAFC 135 at [89] .</sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] FCA 474">The relevant society to which the claimants belong is the Western Desert Social and Cultural Bloc (WDB). The WDB has been well-documented by anthropologists (see eg R Berndt, "The concept of the tribe in the Western Desert of Australia", Oceania 30 (2): 81-107 1959) and has been recognised in numerous Federal Court decisions (see eg James on behalf of the Martu People v Western Australia [2002] FCA 1208 ; Jango v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 318 ; De Rose v State of South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 ( De Rose ). </sentence>

In any event, as counsel for the Applicants submitted in reply, the fact that some particular laws and customs may also be acknowledged and observed by other Aboriginal groups is not inconsistent with the existence of a south-west society: see Jango v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 318 at [350] . Counsel for the State went on to say, correctly in my opinion, that there is 'no evidence of any overall unity or political organisation amongst the various Aboriginal groups at sovereignty. In particular there is no evidence that the Aboriginal people in the south-west of Western Australia had a sense of identity as a distinct people'.</sentence>
