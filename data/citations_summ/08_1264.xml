<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 932">Although the Franchise Agreement has a specific law provision providing that it is governed by the laws of Queensland and that the parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Queensland courts, in this regard (and also in relation to the Queensland FT Act ) the Court adopts, with respect, what was said by the Federal Court in PEP Community Services Inc. t/as PEP Community Services v Jobs Futures Ltd [85] where the Federal Court said that: 9. It is to be noted that cl 35 is not an exclusive jurisdiction clause but I accept that it does disclose an intention on the part of the contracting parties to the litigation to prefer any dispute arising under the contract to be conducted in courts within the specified State: Australian Co-operative Foods Ltd &amp; Anor v National Foods Milk Ltd [1998] FCA 376 and Aquila Resources Limited v Pasminco Limited [2004] FCA 39 at [36] - [41]. 10. However, I also accept the applicant's submission that such a clause in a change of venue application does not carry weight where federal legislation is involved: Plantagenet Wines Pty Ltd v Lion Nathan Wine Group Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 247 at [61] per Siopis J. It is true also that little weight is attached to such a clause where State legislation is involved providing that such legislation is reasonably uniform in nature: Westpac Banking Corporation v O'Brien [1997] ACTSC 107 ; Rothwells Ltd (in liq) v Connell [1995] QSC 30. In this regard, it may be that the Court is required to construe the New South Wales Restraints of Trade Act 1976 (NSW) but no particular difficulty in doing so was advanced in argument...
