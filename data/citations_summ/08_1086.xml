<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 363">NOPL contends that the costs of and incidental to the notice of motion ought to be reserved on the footing that, in the circumstances, neither party could be said to have been entirely successful on the hearing of the motion; consistently with the decision of Buchanan J in Walker v Body Logic Resources [2008] FCA 1086 , it is not appropriate to make a separate order for costs until the determination of the merits in the principal proceeding; and, the notice of motion was scheduled for a day on which the matter was listed for directions and thus Tarong and NOPL would necessarily have been appearing before the Court in any event. </sentence>
