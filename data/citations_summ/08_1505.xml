<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 167">
 
 
 82 In Kirby v Centro Properties, [37] Finkelstein J said of this power under Part IVA of the Federal Court Act: 
 
 
 It is convenient to deal first with the application under s 33ZF. [52] This is a "new phenomenon", commented upon by Finkelstein J: 
 
 
 This is litigation where the lawyer investigates the potential for a claim and recruits the plaintiff and often the group on whose behalf a class action is initiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] QPEC 63">Federal Court decisions which refer to Lewis and bespeak a concern at the unnecessary complications and costs generated by separate representation include Hamod v State of New South Wales [2001] FCA 157 at [57] and Kirby v Centro Properties Ltd [2008] FCA 1505.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] VSC 70">22 ASIC contends that the purpose of this rule is to promote efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation and thereby to save public and private resources, time and cost. ASIC contends that the Courts have consistently said that so far as possible issues that have already been determined by the court should not be re-litigated. It says that consistently with this principle, the courts strive to ensure that multiple proceedings raising the same or similar issues are not tried separately since this could lead to inconsistent decisions and the waste of scarce public and private resources. As authority for these propositions, ASIC refers to and relies upon: Kirby v Centro Properties Ltd; [4] Hughes Motor Service Pty Ltd v Wang Computer Ltd; [5] Commonwealth v Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd; [6] Silbermann v CGU Insurance; [7] A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v The Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union; [8] Business and Professional Leasing Pty Ltd v Dannawi; [9] McMahon v Gould [10] ; and Spitfire Nominees Ltd v Thompson &amp; Hall. [11] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] NSWDC 273">15. Finkelstein J in Kirby v Centro Properties Ltd [2008] FCA 1505 , handed down on 10 October 2008, noted (at [11]) in a case concerning the difficult question of what is sometimes called "lawyer-led litigation" (in other words, class actions):
 

 
"It is true that separate representation is sometimes allowed. For example, it was allowed in Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd (1999) 56 ATPR 41-679 at [70], but only on the basis that the solicitors agreed jointly to engage one set of counsel to represent the named plaintiffs. But if there is a falling out between separately represented co-plaintiffs, one would have to be removed as plaintiff and added as a defendant: Holden v Silkstone and Dodworth Coal &amp; Iron Co Ltd (1881) 45 TLR (NS) 531. "</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1657">5 When a subsequent check, after the writing and just prior to the delivery on 10 October 2008 of my reasons for decision in relation to the respondents' motion for a stay ( Kirby v Centro Properties Limited [2008] FCA 1505) , revealed Motown's holding, I promptly disclosed it to the parties in open court. In response to further inquiries from Freehills, who act for CNP and CPT Manager, the respondents in two actions, by letter dated 17 October 2008 (a Friday), my staff provided most of the historical information set out above in an email sent on Monday, 20 October 2008. </sentence>
