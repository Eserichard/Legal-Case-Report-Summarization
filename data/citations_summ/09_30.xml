<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 691">(j) The Republic of Hungary has, further, refused and failed to inform the Applicant or the Minister how the Applicant would be able to have a fair trial in accordance with international standards, when he will be unable to access relevant official documentary evidence (destroyed in the time elapsed since 1944) about the movement of his unit of the Royal Hungarian Army that would enable him to establish that he was not in Budapest at the time of the commission of the alleged offence in Budapest. (k) The Minister, in the absence of such information and assurances and without making any further enquiry, has made his determination that the Applicant should be surrendered for extradition, apparently because the Military Panel is bound by the provisions of the ECHR and ICCPR and that it is therefore not for the Australian Government to enquire into or make judgments about whether the Military Panel and its procedures will, in fact, be able to comply with the international standards for a fair trial (Departmental Attachment C paras 103, 219). (l) In that regard, the Minister has been misled by the selective reference in the Departmental Attachment C (para 33, dot point 7 and para 190) to the decision of this Honourable Court in Mokbel v Attorney-General for the Commonwealth (2007) 162 FCA (sic-FCR) 278 at [58]-[59], said to be authority that in accordance with the principle of comity a degree of respect is to be accorded by a requested country to the laws and institutions of another country, but omitting reference to Snedden v Republic of Croatia [2009] FCA 30 (a decision of the Full Federal Court to which the Applicant referred in his Supplementary Submissions to the Minister dated 26 October 2009) in which the contrary proposition was stated, namely that Australian court may , in an appropriate case, determine that a country requesting the extradition of an Australian citizen cannot provide a fair and unbiased trial in the event of extradition, and if so, that extradition must be refused. (m) The Minister, in accepting that "comity" prevents him from considering whether, having regard to the particular evidentiary problems presented by the non-availability of key witnesses, the procedures of the Military Tribunal are actually capable of affording the Applicant a just and fair trial in accordance with relevant international standards has fettered his discretion and abdicated his responsibility to address that question. (n) The Minister has in that regard asked himself the wrong question: the issue is not whether the Military Division is capable of providing a fair trial because it is bound by the ECHR and ICCPR ; it is whether the Hungarian authorities can provide assurances to the Australian Government as to how they can, in fact, afford a fair trial to the Applicant in accordance with the ECHR and ICCPR in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] HCA 14">On 12 April 2007, a magistrate of the Local Court of New South Wales (Cloran DCM) determined that the respondent was eligible for surrender to Croatia pursuant to s 19(9) of the Extradition Act . The respondent applied for a review of the magistrate's decision in the Federal Court of Australia pursuant to s 21(1) of the Extradition Act . On 3 February 2009, Cowdroy J dismissed the application for review [58] . The respondent appealed to the Full Court, which allowed the appeal on the basis that an "extradition objection" existed in terms of s 7(c) [59] . The respondent relied solely on s 7(c) where previously he had relied on both ss 7(b) and 7 (c) [60] . 
  The respondent failed to satisfy the magistrate that there were substantial grounds for believing that any extradition objection existed. The magistrate determined that he was eligible for extradition. The respondent failed again in review proceedings before a judge of the Federal Court pursuant to s 21 of the Extradition Act [2] . However, on 2 September 2009 the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia found an extradition objection made out on the basis that, in sentencing for offences of the kind alleged against the respondent, prior service in the Croatian armed forces was treated by Croatian courts as a mitigating factor and was ipso facto not available to those who had fought on the Serbian side of the conflict. It held there were therefore substantial grounds for believing that the respondent might be punished, detained or restricted in his personal liberty by reason of his political opinions [3] . The Full Court allowed the appeal against the decision of the primary judge of that Court and directed that the respondent be released from custody.
