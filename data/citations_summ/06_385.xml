<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 1442">509 The scope of any retainer and the ambit of the implied duty to carry out the retainer with reasonable care, depends upon the facts peculiar to the relationship between the solicitor and the client in each case: Larsen v Lynch [2006] FCA 385 at [27] . Reference was made in that case to the observations of Oliver J in Midland Bank Trust Co Limited v Hett, Stubbs &amp; Kemp (A Firm) [1979] 1 Ch 384 at 402; "there is no such thing as a general retainer in that sense. The expression 'my solicitor' is as meaningless as the expression 'my tailor' or 'my bookmaker' in establishing any general duty apart from that arising out of a particular matter in which his services are retained" .</sentence>
