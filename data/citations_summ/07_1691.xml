<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1046">While an aspect of the Tribunal's reasons for decision was that the applicant gave certain evidence to the previously constituted Tribunal in response to its questioning and that those answers were inconsistent, implausible and not credible, as conceded by the applicant such evidence from the applicant to the Tribunal as originally constituted is within the exception in s.424A(3)(b) as information that the applicant gave for the purposes of the review. It is well established that when a matter is remitted to the Tribunal for reconsideration the evidence before the Tribunal as originally constituted does not lose its character as information presented " to the Tribunal " for the purposes of the review (see SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Another [2006] FCAFC 107 ; (2006) 159 FCR 291 at [39] ; SZJHX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1337 at [45] ; SZJXH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1691 at [25] ; SZGNY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural [2006] FMCA 1142 at [21] ; and SZHUI &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 1042 at [62] --- [63]) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 679">Further, I note that in SZJXH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1691 , a matter on appeal from this Court, Greenwood J said at [25]: "One question which has arisen for particular assessment is the question of whether it was appropriate for the Tribunal in evaluating the evidence of the appellant to have regard to evidence given to the Tribunal constituted in its earlier form. It is clear however, that information given to the earlier Tribunal is information given by the appellant as part of the 'application' and there is no failure to comply with s 424A(1) having regard to the exception contained in s 424A(3)(b) of the Migration Act . I regard the legitimacy of recourse by the Tribunal to the earlier evidence given by the appellant to an earlier Tribunal, as an entirely settled matter. Note the observations in SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 at [39] . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 2037">My conclusion of jurisdictional error which is explained above does not require me to choose between some differences in judgments of the Federal Court in relation to the power of the Tribunal to rely upon a previous Tribunal's conduct of a hearing under s.425 and upon evidence given at such a hearing. Until recently, the position identified by the present Tribunal had been taken in this Court, and was upheld in the Federal Court (see, for example, my decisions in SZFAS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 1029 ; (2006) 201 FLR 312 at [16] - [17], SZGNY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 1142 at [18] - [22], and SZILQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 483 at [24] - [36]). Emmett J upheld my judgment in SZGNY (see SZGNY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 384). Greenwood J in SZJXH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1691 at [25] said: "I regard the legitimacy of recourse by the Tribunal to the earlier evidence given by the appellant to an earlier Tribunal, as an entirely settled matter" . </sentence>
