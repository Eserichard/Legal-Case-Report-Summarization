<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 698">

 
 We note that the third order of the Draft Orders is expressed to extend the time for the lodgement of a notice of Variation (Variation) under section 650D(1)(a) of the Act, to the date of the Court's orders. We think that this should refer to either section 650D(1) or alternatively section 650D(1)(b). We note that in the matter of Re Emerald Capital Limited [2008] FCA 1739 the Court made orders extending the period for the bidder to give a new notice under section 650D(1). 

 
 We further note that under section 650C(2) of the Act, where a bid is subject to a defeating condition, the bidder may extend the offer after the publication of the notice under section 630(3) only if certain prescribed events occur after that date. Those prescribed events do not apply to Blaze's bid and the proposed Variation purports to extend the bid in circumstances where Blaze had not given the notice required by section 630(3). Contrary to Target's contention, Blaze contends the effect of proposed order 3 is to firstly extend the time for the service of the notice under s 650D extending the offer period and, secondly, to impose conditions on the grant of relief. It is the conditions which affect the form of the notice which will be given if an order is made, and make it different, in form, from that given on 11 June 2009, that is, the substance of the notice, extending the offer period, to 17 July 2009 will be the same. The substance of the order, is reflected by the following words:- 
 The time to lodge a notice of variation as required by Section 650D(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ( Notice ) with ASIC is extended to 4pm on the date of these orders. (Emphasis in original) 

and is essentially the same as the order made in, for example, Re Emerald Capital Ltd [2008] FCA 1739 and the same form of words as used in order 1 in Re Emerald Capital and could, if the Court thinks appropriate, be adopted. In Re Emerald Capital , the order permitted the plaintiff to serve a:
 
 new notice under sections 650D(1) , 630 (2) and 630 (3) of the Act. (Emphasis supplied)
