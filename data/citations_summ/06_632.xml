<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] SASC 27">There has been much discussion about the approach to be taken when considering the question of when a debt is due. [14] The preferred position is that a debt is due when it is legally repayable. The conduct of a creditor in not seeking to recover a debt, or from taking other enforcement action, does not mean the debt is not due and payable. In considering whether a debt is due, the Court will look to the legally binding agreement between the parties. Often, creditors will withhold taking action to enforce a debt. This may occur for a variety of reasons, including that a creditor may not wish to put at risk an ongoing commercial arrangement, or the creditor may be prepared to give the debtor time because the creditor believes the debtor has temporary liquidity problems. The Court will have regard to commercial reality and, in considering the question, will take into account whether there has been an express or implied agreement between the creditor and debtors to extend the time stipulated for payment, and whether there has been a course of conduct from which it can be concluded that debts are payable, other than as stipulated in the contract.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1121">An inability to produce timely and accurate financial information to display the company's trading performance and financial position and make reliable forecasts. Such of these factors as are present in a given case will carry different weight according to the circumstances of the particular case. Further, they interplay one with another. Finally, and at the risk of repetition, it is not a checklist exercise in which one is engaged, but rather an overall assessment as against a statutory test of the circumstances revealed on the evidence in respect of the company. In that fashion, for example, and as has been observed by Emmett J in Quick v Stoland Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 1200 ; (1998) 87 FCR 371 at 380, that there may exist an excess of current liabilities over current assets is not conclusive of a company's insolvency and "cannot be more than a rule of thumb" as to the same. In like fashion, a failure to pay a debt is not, without anything else, conclusive of insolvency: Truefor Service Pty Ltd v Jenkins (No 2) [2006] FCA 632 ; (2006) 232 ALR 532. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 133">It is true that it is possible to find authority which stands for the proposition that the tendering of exhibits in the course of the evidence of an applicant's witness's evidence does not preclude the ability to make a no case submission at the end of an applicant's case: see True Floor Service Proprietary Limited v Jenkins (No 2) [2006] FCA 632 ; (2006) 232 ALR 532 (True Floor Case). That is not this case. Here, the position is akin to a desire to make a no case submission after the oral evidence in chief of the respondent has been received but before that respondent is cross-examined. </sentence>

 [1] Twelve years ago, in 1996, a group of neighbours entered into legally binding arrangements together to develop and subdivide some of the land of which they were individual owners ("the land owners"). This litigation unfortunately has revealed the unforseen perils of that course, perhaps suggesting that, in accordance with the views of the curmudgeonly neighbour in Robert Frost's poem "Mending Wall", "Good fences make good neighbours. " 
 [2] The neighbours owned property set in bushland a few kilometres west of Nerang on Mt Nathan Road which is the road between Beaudesert and Nerang. In addition, the information given to them by the directors showed that even if the company was not then insolvent, it was likely to become insolvent. [112] Insolvency is a question of fact to be determined in the particular circumstances by the application of legal principle. [14] The classic exposition of insolvency is found in the statement of Barwick CJ in Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 670: 
 
"Insolvency is ... an inability to pay debts as they fall due out of the debtor's own money. But the debtor's own moneys are not limited to his cash resources immediately available. They extend to moneys which he can procure by realization by sale or by mortgage or pledge of his assets within a relatively short time --- relative to the nature and amount of the debts and to the circumstances, including the nature of the business, of the debtor.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1292">19 In the present case, for the reasons indicated at the hearing, I determined that I would not rule on whether the respondents should be required to make their election until after the parties had addressed argument on the no-case submission, and as to whether the respondents should be required to make an election. It seemed to me that it was appropriate to take this course in order to understand the nature of the argument the respondents sought to make in saying that they had no case to answer. This was the approach adopted by Fullagar J in Union Bank of Australia Ltd v Puddy [1949] VicLawRp 46 ; [1949] VLR 242 (" Puddy "); by Finkelstein J in Compaq Computer ; by Branson J at first instance in Rasomen (see Rasomen Pty Ltd v Shell Co of Australia Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 540 at 543); by Sundberg J in Tru Floor Service Pty Ltd v Jenkins (No 2) [2006] FCA 632 ; (2006) 232 ALR 532 (" Tru Floor ") at 537; and approved by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Protean . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] VSC 68">2), [22] Sundberg J referred to Protean, Sarkis, Rasomen, and the decision of Finkelstein J in Compaq Computer Australia Pty Ltd v Merry, [23] and concluded [24] that, where a judge sits alone, the function of the judge was "no different from that which has to be performed by a judge who has heard all the evidence in the ordinary way and who has to give final judgment. 2) [2006] FCA 632 , [37] --- [40] (Sundberg J).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] NSWSC 998">166 An excess of current liabilities over current assets is not conclusive of a company's insolvency and "cannot be more than a rule of thumb": Quick v Stoland [1998] FCA 1200 ; (1998) 29 ACSR 130 at 139 per Emmett J; Tru Floor Service Pty Ltd v Jenkins (No. 2) [2006] FCA 632 ; (2006) 232 ALR 532 at 543 [43] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1182">

41 The same submission that was thus rejected in Protean was put to the Full Court of this Court in Rasomen . The submission is recorded at 75 FCR at 227. It was rejected in reliance on what had been said in Protean . At 228 the Full Court said:
 
 "the function to be performed by a trial judge sitting without a jury ... is no different from that which has to be performed by a judge who has heard all the evidence of the parties in the ordinary way and who has to give final judgment. In both situations, the judge must make findings of fact, after assessing the quality of the evidence. "
