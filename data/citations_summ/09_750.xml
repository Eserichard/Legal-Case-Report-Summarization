 Before leaving this matter, I should record that after I reserved my decision on 16 June 2009, Mr Boyce submitted some further written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 187">2 The appeal is from a judgment of a single judge of the Court, published as Communications Electrical Electronic Energy Information Postal Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Blue Star Pacific Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 750. On 30 June 2009, his Honour made a declaration to the effect that Blue Star had not complied with its obligation under s 340(2)(a) of the Workplace Relations Act and a declaration that the proposed agreement, the Blue Star Pacific Employee Agreement 2009 - 2013 had not been approved validly pursuant to s 340. His Honour's reasons for judgment were published on 14 July 2009. Declarations substantially in the form made by his Honour were sought in the proceeding at first instance by the respondent to this appeal, the Communications Electrical Electronic Energy Information Postal Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia ("the CEPU"), an organisation of employees registered pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act at the time, and now pursuant to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (Cth).
  72 The primary judge held, firstly, that the appellant was required to, but did not give, its employees a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they wanted to approve the proposed agreement because, in all the circumstances, it did not afford them the opportunity to meet together at the same time and place and discuss the proposed agreement as a group (see Communications Electrical Electronic Energy Information Postal Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia v Blue Star Pacific Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 750 at [62.1] ). Secondly, his Honour held, at [62.2], that the employees were likely to be adversely affected by false information on the relevant ballot paper about the period of operation of the proposed agreement, such that they were denied a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they wanted to approve the proposed agreement.</sentence>
