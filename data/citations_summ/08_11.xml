<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 108">The Migration Act and the authorities clearly disclose the basis for mandated judicial review. Section 65 of the Migration Act provides that the Minister is to grant a protection visa application if he is "satisfied" that the relevant criteria have been met and deny the application if he is "not so satisfied". However, the Minister (or the Tribunal: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 (' SGLB ') at 20 [37]) is only empowered to make a determination regarding the relevant state of satisfaction where that determination is based on findings or inferences of fact that are grounded upon probative material and logical grounds: see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMDS [2010] HCA 16 ; (2010) 266 ALR 367 (' SZMDS ') at 376-77 [37] ---[42] per Gummow ACJ and Kiefel J (dissenting as to the application of law to facts) (citing, amongst other authorities, SGLB 207 ALR at 20-21 [37]-[38] per Gummow and Hayne JJ; WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 80 ALD 568 (' WAIJ ') at 573-74 [17]-[26] per Lee and Moore JJ 573-74 [22]; and SZLGP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1198 at [15] per Gordon J) and 388-389 [102]-[105], 393-96 [121]-[131] per Crennan and Bell JJ (citing, amongst other authorities, Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 (' Avon Downs ') at 360 per Dixon J; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu (1999) 197 CLR 611 (' Eshetu ') at 657 [147] per Gummow J). As stated by Gummow and Hayne JJ in SGLB (207 ALR at 20 [37]-[38]):
 The satisfaction of the Minister is a condition precedent to the discharge of the obligation to grant or refuse to grant the visa, and is a "jurisdictional fact" or criterion upon which the exercise of that authority is conditioned. .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] MRTA 586">The term "character test" in PIC 4001 is not defined in the Regulations. However, the Federal Court has held that the reference to the character test in PIC 4001 is a reference to the provisions of s.501(6) of the Act: Awa v MIMIA (2002) 189 ALR 328 at [11] and SZLDG v MIAC [2008] FCA 11 ; (2008) 166 FCR 230 (Lindgren J, 17 January 2008) at [86]. This approach is consistent with s.13(1)(b) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 , in that expressions used in a legislative instrument have the same meaning as in the enabling legislation unless the contrary intention appears. Subsection 501(6) of the Act, which is entitled "Character Test", provides as follows: 
 
 For the purposes of this section, a person does not pass the character test if: 
 

 
 
 (a) the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection (7)); or 
 (b) the person has or has had an association with someone else, or with a group or organisation, whom the Minister reasonably suspects has been or is involved in criminal conduct; or 
 (c) having regard to either or both of the following: 
 (i) the person's past and present criminal conduct; 
 (ii) the person's past and present general conduct; 
 the person is not of good character; or 
 (d) in the event the person were allowed t o enter or to remain in Australia , there is a significant risk that the person would: 
 (i) engage in criminal conduct in Australia; or 
 (ii) harass, molest , intimidate or stalk another person in Australia; or 
 (iii) vilify a segment of the Australian community; or 
 (iv) incite discord in the Australian community or in a segment of that community; or 
 (v) represent a danger to the Australian community or to a segment of that community, whether by way of being liable to become involved in activities that are disruptive to, or in violence threatening harm to, that community or segment, or in any other way. 
 

 
 Otherwise, the person passes the </sentence>
