<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 824">Insofar as the applicant's contention was that the information the Tribunal had obtained from the previously constituted Tribunal should not be regarded as information which he had given to the Tribunal and that such information must be put to him under s.424A(1) of the Migration Act , information provided to the Tribunal as originally constituted is information provided for the purposes of the review within s.424A(3)(b) of the Migration Act (see SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [17] ; SZITD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1343 at [22] and SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Another [2006] FCAFC 107 ; (2006) 159 FCR 291 at [39] ). The Tribunal as reconstituted was entitled to have regard to such evidence and the information or material provided to the first Tribunal whether in writing or orally at the first hearing (such as the applicant's claims about handing out flyers to strangers, his place of residence or his detention in March 2003). It was information which he provided to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review and is not subject to the obligation in s.424A(1) of the Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 228">It was an attempt by the Tribunal to comply with what it perceived to be its procedural obligations under s.424A(1). As it turned out, it was not obliged to put the information referred to in the 424A letter to the applicant pursuant to s.424A(1) as the information in the applicant's application for protection visa did not in its own terms constitute rejection, denial or undermining of the applicant's claims and the appraisal of that information was not itself information: SZBYR at [17]-[25]. The remainder of the applicant's evidence was given by the applicant to the Tribunal for the purpose of his application for review, notwithstanding that it was given to previously constituted Tribunals, and was excepted from s.424A(1) by reason of s.424A(3): NBKT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (2006)156 FCR 419 at [41]-[64]; SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 at [39] ; SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [17] ; SZITD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1343 at [22] ; SZGYV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 1313 at [5]. The Tribunal was entitled to make reference to the evidence that the applicant had given to the Tribunal as twice previously constituted: SZJBE. To the extent that the reasoning in SZHLM is inconsistent with Full Federal Court authority in SZEPZ that reasoning is erroneous and the Court should apply the Full Federal Court authority of SZEPZ and the authorities of SZJBE, SZITD and SZGYV which have clearly applied SZEPZ or are consistent with the propositions accepted by the Court in SZEPZ.</sentence>
