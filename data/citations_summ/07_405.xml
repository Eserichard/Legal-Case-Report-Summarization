Accordingly the decision under review denying liability will be set aside and a decision in substitution, finding liability will be made. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 393">22 A Statement of Facts and Contentions should obviously not be construed with the constraints appropriate to a pleading in a Superior Court. Nor should a Statement of Facts and Contentions be filed with such generality that all issues which potentially may emerge will be held subsequently to fall within one or other of the matters set forth. But it should be drafted with a sufficient level of precision to enable both an opponent and the Tribunal to know the facts and contentions being raised for consideration. The procedures of the Tribunal are sufficiently flexible to permit of any subsequent need to revisit a Statement which has been filed if that is necessary to ensure that the " correct or preferable decision " is reached and reached in a manner which permits all parties to have a " reasonable opportunity to present his or her case ": Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), s 39(1). Within those broad limits, the procedures followed by the Tribunal should be sufficiently flexible to permit new or additional contentions to be raised, where that is necessary to ensure that the Tribunal properly discharges its functions, and sufficiently flexible to ensure that contentions which may have been initially raised at the outset of proceedings are able to be later abandoned (eg, Comcare v Holt [2007] FCA 405 at [33] , [2007] FCA 405 ; [2007] FCA 405 ; 94 ALD 576 at 583 per Mansfield J). </sentence>
