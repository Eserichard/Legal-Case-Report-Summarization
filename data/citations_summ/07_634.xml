<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 67">60 This argument fails. The power in s 98(3) is expressed as a power to cancel an approval in the exercise of a discretion. It is not in terms a discretion to make, grant or issue an instrument, being the notice. A notice of the cancellation in writing is required to be given to the pharmacist by s 98(3). The notice is made necessary, doubtless, so that the pharmacist will be informed of the fact that his or her approval has been cancelled. It is the mode prescribed by s 98(3) of communicating the making of the decision to exercise the discretion to cancel. Importantly, s 105AB(8A) of the Health Act gives a pharmacist a right to apply to the Tribunal for a review of a decision of the Secretary under s 98(3) to revoke an approval. That suggests that the relevant exercise of power under s 98(3) is one of cancellation not a power to make an instrument or issue a notice: Nicholson-Brown v Jennings [2007] FCA 634 ; (2007) 162 FCR 337 at 349 [27] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 63">Given this conclusion, it is probably unnecessary to consider the alternative basis on which the power to decide not to cancel exercised on 26 May 2009 is said to have arisen, namely by operation of s 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act which would require, as I understood the submission, the provision conferring power to cancel an approval as also conferring a power exercisable from time to time to rescind or revoke the cancellation. Having regard to the nature of the power and the statutory scheme requiring, in some circumstances, a procedure to be followed leading to a recommendation by the Authority before an approval is given, I would have thought that the NH Act evinced an intention that the cancellation power, once exercised, could not be exercised again to rescind or revoke the cancellation with the practical and legal consequence of creating an approval. In addition, I doubt that the power conferred by s 98(3) of the NH Act is a power of the type addressed by s 33(3) to "make, grant or issue any instrument" even though notice of the cancellation must be given in writing. It is simply a decision which must be evidenced in writing: Laurence v Chief of Navy [2004] FCA 1535 ; (2004) 139 FCR 555. The subsection concerns a power to cancel an approval and not a power to make, grant or issue any instrument: Nicholson-Brown v Jennings [2007] FCA 634 ; (2007) 162 FCR 337 at [27] .
