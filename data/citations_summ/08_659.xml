<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 236">This was not a satisfactory way to conduct this litigation, particularly given the nature of the orders made on 7 March 2008. Having regard to the circumstances above, I am of opinion that in the exercise of my discretion under s 85A(1) of the Act and s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) I should order the Jangga People to pay the costs of the State and Mount Isa Mines in respect of the notice of motion. I discussed the principles applicable to the exercise of the discretion to order costs in Birri Gubba (Cape Upstart) People v State of Queensland [2008] FCA 659 at [20] - [25]. And, I consider that it is appropriate to require the Northern Queensland Land Council to show cause why it should not be ordered to pay those costs on party/party basis having regard to its apparent (on the material before me) responsibility for the costs I have ordered the Jangga People to pay: Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178. I certify that the preceding twenty-seven (27) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares. Associate:
 
 
Dated: 18 March 2009
 
 Solicitor appearing for the Jangga People: Mr P van der Eyk

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1696">In March this year, I made, once again, directions to regularise both matters with a view to assisting in the proper formulation of a claim for the persons truly entitled to bring applications under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth). At that time the applicants were in default in the Birri-Gubba case. This resulted in the State seeking an order for costs against the Birri-Gubba applicants for wasted time and effort that had been incurred in previous failed attempts to obtain preservation evidence. After hearing argument I ordered that the Birri-Gubba applicants pay 50 per cent of the costs of the State relating to its preparation for and appearance at directions hearings in relation to the issue of what evidence ought to be preserved for the period between 1 December 2006 and 17 October 2007: Birri-Gubba (Cape Upstart) People v State of Queensland [2008] FCA 659. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 926">55 The issues involved are, at one level, complex. The applicants in the first motion have not been represented by solicitors or counsel. I would not, in the circumstances, be prepared to characterise the conduct of the applicants in the first motion as being unreasonable. This is so, even though I have concluded that the first motion has no reasonable prospect of success. The position may well have been different if the applicants in the first motion had been represented by experienced lawyers: cf Birri-Gubba (Cape Upstart) People v State of Queensland [2008] FCA 659. [37] These observations should not be seen in any way as a reflection on Ms Hanigan. Ms Hanigan is a law student who I have no doubt has been doing her best to represent the interests of the applicants in the first motion. They are not in receipt of public funding. </sentence>
