<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1272">Order 53 r 3(2)(a), as interpreted by the Full Court in Etheridge 149 FCR at [16], requires a question of law to be stated with precision as a pure question of law. Question (a) in notice of appeal does not do that. It is ambiguous. It does not identify the manner in which the Tribunal failed properly to apply the SoP. The Tribunal may have made an error of fact, of mixed fact and law or of law, in applying the SoP. Cf Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambrouglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524, 529; Roper v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1610 ; (2008) 108 ALD 16 at [21] , [29] and Price Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 154 ; (2007) 97 ALD 593 at [23] . I do not accept the appellant's submission that question (1) at [24] is capable of falling within question (a) in the notice of appeal. Even if it does, that would not assist, because the latter does not comply with s 44(1) and rule 3(2)(a). </sentence>
