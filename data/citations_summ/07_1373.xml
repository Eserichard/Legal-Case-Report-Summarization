<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 49">40 The third ground complains of the Federal Magistrate's use of the term "impressionistic criteria" at par [44], when describing the criteria for the visa. In granting leave to appeal, Spender J said that it is open to argument whether the factual integers in Reg 1.15A can properly be described as "impressionistic criteria": Ally v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1373 at par [37] . However, we see no error in the use of this description as an appropriate label for the criteria of a mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others and a relationship that is genuine and continuing.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 355">In the present circumstances, when considering the merits of the proposed appeal, it is important also to consider the risks of doing an injustice. If other factors favour the granting of the relief sought, the fact that the appeal might not ultimately succeed but nevertheless is reasonably arguable should not stand in the way of granting relief. In Ally v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1373 it was said that 'the fact that an appeal is unlikely to succeed is a different question from whether an appeal has any prospect of success or is arguable'. At [41] --- [45], Spender J said:
 
 The respondent submits:
 
 The sole basis for the respondent's opposition to the application is that, in the respondent's submission, the proposed appeal does not have sufficient prospects to justify the Court's discretion being exercised in the applicant's favour. It was submitted, in short, that the proposed appeal would be bound to fail.</sentence>

 14. This passage was approved by Spender J in Ally v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1373 at [29] , although his Honour gave leave for an appeal from my failure to be satisfied that such an error was shown in the Tribunal's reasoning in that case.</sentence>
