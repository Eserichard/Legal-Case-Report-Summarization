<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] AATA 402">It was Mr d'Assumpcao's submission that, although there were half-brothers and a half-sister of the applicant involved, these were not relevant in the consideration of the third primary consideration because there was no evidence of a parental or other close relationship involving the applicant. When questioned by the Tribunal about the applicant's relationship with his half-sister, Bonnie, Mr d'Assumpcao submitted that the words "other close" in paragraph 2.3(c) of the Direction were qualified by the word "parental". The operation of paragraph 2.3(c) was considered by Lander J, in the Federal Court, in Lam v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 445 where, at paragraph 83 he said: 
 "83. Because Ministerial Direction No. 21 identifies the class of children whose best interests are required to be a primary consideration in the decision making process, an applicant cannot have a legitimate expectation that the best interests of any other child or children not within that class would be the subject of an assessment by the decision maker considering the application generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] AATA 1100">This contention is contrary to the decision of Lander J in Lam v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 445 at [57] and [59], insofar as it is based on the relationship between Mr Hancock and his grandchildren, rather than Ms Nget and the grandchildren.</sentence>
