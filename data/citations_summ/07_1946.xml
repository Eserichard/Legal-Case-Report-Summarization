<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1244">In those circumstances, and in view of Mr Eau's failure to oppose Mr Pascoe's present application, I accept the submission that I should characterise the amounts held in the Westpac account, both before and after Mr Eau's bankruptcy, as gross business receipts of his business intended primarily for payment of its creditors, and not of the nature of personal income of Mr Eau under the ordinary concepts of income. The usual tests for the ordinary concept of income were applied in the context of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) by Finkelstein J in Lockwood v Vince [2007] FCA 1946 ; (2007) 166 FCR 305 at [15] : Whether or not a payment is income according to ordinary concepts depends upon the characterisation of the payment in the hands of the recipient. A payment will be income if it is received as a reward for the provision of services or for some other revenue producing activity: Scott v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1966] HCA 48 ; (1966) 117 CLR 514 ; Hayes v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1956] HCA 21; (1956) 96 CLR 47 ; Squatting Investment Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1953] HCA 13 ; (1953) 86 CLR 570. That is, for a payment to be income the payment must be remuneration obtained from personal exertion (eg wages), from carrying on a business (eg profit) or from the use of capital (eg dividends, interest). (see also Lockhart J in In the Matter of the Bankrupt Estate of John Lawrence Sharpe; Re John Lawrence Sharpe; Ex Parte: Max Christopher Donnelly [1998] FCA 6). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] NSWSC 928">


21 Thus, in effect, on separation Ms Barbour had or took over complete control of the Classic No 2 Account, and the car loan account, and used the NEVS account for her own purposes after the video store business was sold and that account should have been closed. Ms Barbour also controlled Classic No 1 Account, but part of its use was a joint purpose of repaying the home loans. Being a joint holder does not exclude arrangements that alter the beneficial entitlement to monies in the account: see the discussion in Croton v The Queen [1967] HCA 48 ; (1967) 117 CLR 326 per Barwick CJ at p 332, with whom McTiernan J agreed, and see James v Oxley [1939] HCA 1 ; (1939) 61 CLR 433 , 454 per Dixon J cited in Batty (infra); Lockwood v Vince [2007] FCA 1946 ; (2007) 166 FCR 305 at [24] per Finkelstein J on the question of control.</sentence>
