<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 635">This could overcome the issue I identified in GE Capital Finance v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 558 ; (2007) 159 FCR 473. Of course, in GE Capital Finance the Court was not dealing with the associated enterprises articles, so the above argument was not raised by the parties nor considered by me. Legislative Provisions

 Preamble 
 
 This publication provides you with the following level of protection: 
This publication is a draft for public comment. It represents the Commissioner's preliminary view about the way in which a relevant taxation provision applies, or would apply to entities generally or to a class of entities in relation to a particular scheme or a class of schemes. 24. [2008] AATA 639 ; 2008 ATC 10-036 ; (2008) 70 ATR 703 (Roche) . Other cases have touched on the general issue of the status of the treaties, though none dealt with transfer pricing issues: see McDermott Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v. Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 67 ; (2005) 142 FCR 134 at [2] ; Commissioner of Taxation v. Lamesa Holdings BV (1997) 77 FCR 597 at 600-1; Chong v. Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 635 ; (2000) 101 FCR 134 (Chong) at [26] ; GE Capital Finance Pty Ltd v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 558 ; (2007) 159 FCR 473 at [36] , [37] and Undershaft (No 1) Limited v. Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 41 (Undershaft) at [45] , [46]. In Undershaft, Lindgren J cited, inter alia, Chong and reiterated that the tax treaty does not give the contracting State a power to tax, or oblige it to tax but, rather, avoids the potential for double taxation by restricting one contracting State's taxing power. </sentence>
