<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] HCATrans 541">On the same day Justice Finn ordered that the application in relation to the third respondent, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, be dismissed ( Clarkson v Commonwealth (No 2) [2006] FCA 1839). Further, so far as the plaintiff is in these proceedings seeking to challenge Justice Finn's orders in Clarkson v Commonwealth (No 2) [2006] FCA 1839 , the correct course, if he is so advised, is to exhaust the appellate process in the Federal Court of Australia if he has not done so and then to seek special leave to appeal.</sentence>
