<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] AATA 194">The question is one of fact and will depend on the evidence: Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 90 ALD 31 and whether a psychological condition such as depression is a disease rather than a mental injury may depend on how an applicant puts his or her case: Dunstan v Comcare [2006] FCA 1655 ; (2006) 93 ALD 390. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 449"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 895">Mr Dube argued that the question whether the events complained of by the Applicant are "employment" is a vexed one. He submitted the Federal Court held in Dunstan v Comcare [2006] FCA 1655 ; (2006) 93 ALD 390 that the scope of the Act does not mean that every event which befalls an employee at work, and which leads to an ailment such as depression is work-related in the relevant sense. He submitted that the clearest example of that was the Christmas party in December 2004, and that the issues arising from that event were because of the friendship between the various people, rather than constituting something employment related. He submitted that the Applicant's contention that the Christmas party was an "employment related event" ignores the requirements of Semlitch and the definition of employment. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 504">In my opinion, it is quite clear that, in carrying out its statutory function of deciding a claim for compensation in the manner in which it did in this case, Comcare could not be guilty of discrimination in the respect alleged by Mr Dunstan. Furthermore, the existence of a full appeal on the merits to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affords the appropriate remedy. Mr Dunstan availed himself of that remedy and as the result of an appeal to the Court has had some success ( Dunstan v Comcare [2006] FCA 1655 ; (2006) 93 ALD 390). There is no basis upon which providing the medical report to explain rejection of a claim could amount to harassment as claimed. The proceeding against Comcare has no possibility of success and will be summarily dismissed with costs. </sentence>
