("Would be" not "what was". ) I note also that Federal Court authority does allow for consideration of the Tribunal's decision record in these circumstances, but only as it may assist in what the Tribunal considers "would be" the reason at some anterior point in time ( SZLPJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1721 at [15] to [16], SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 at [14] to [17] and SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] ).

Nevertheless it has also been held that in determining whether information is within s.424A(1) , the Court may have regard to the reasons of the Tribunal, not as a starting point but as material relevant to whether an inference should be drawn that the Tribunal considered particular information would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review (see SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] per Siopis J; SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2009] FCA 99 ; (2009) 107 ALD 121 at [17] --- [18] per Jacobson J; SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 51 ; (2009) 255 ALR 407 at [31] and now see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLFX [2009] HCA 31 at [26] ). As the Full Court of the Federal Court pointed out in SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCAFC 198 ; (2007) 164 FCR 578 (at [33]), the obligation under s.424A(1) is only enlivened where the Tribunal forms the opinion that particular information would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. </sentence>

That is, it is to be determined at the time that the "issue" is formulated in the mind of the Tribunal and not with regard only to the decision record. However, it is the case that reference can be had to the decision record, so long as that reference comprehends that it is for the purpose only of drawing inferences in informing what "would be" the reason or part of the reason at some earlier point in time.

Nonetheless, the Federal Court has made it clear that it is permissible to have regard to the Tribunal's reasons, not as the starting point, but in drawing inferences as to the proper characterisation of information and in determining whether at any anterior time it would be material that the Tribunal considered was the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. (See, for example, SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] , SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 at [17] and SZLPJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1721 at [15] --- [17]. ) </sentence>

His Honour referred with approval to the observations of Siopis J in SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] as follows: [T] he assessment of whether the information enlivened the obligation on the Tribunal under s 424A(1) is made by reference to the time at which the Tribunal becomes aware of the information. Accordingly, and significantly, in light of the submission made by the first respondent, the assessment is not dependent upon the use that the Tribunal subsequently made of the information, although, in my view, that may be a relevant consideration in drawing inferences as to the proper characterisation of the information. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FMCA 425">That information was capable of being characterised as information that may undermine the Applicant's claims. It was information given by the Applicant to the Department orally and was therefore not excluded by s.424A(3)(ba) of the Act ( SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [17] ; SZLPJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1721 at [15] and [16] per Perram J; SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] per Siopis J; SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 at [17] - [18] per Jacobson J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FMCA 333">It must be said that there are some difficult questions about the drawing of an inference in relation to whether s.424A(1)(a) was enlivened where particular information was raised in some way at a Tribunal hearing but was not used in the Tribunal decision (see SZJZB , MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 and SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99). The mere fact that an issue was discussed in some way at a hearing should not of itself preclude the drawing of an inference that s.424A was not enlivened (see SZLPJ at [13]). Nor should it compel an inference that particular information " would be" the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review.  However, rather than suggesting a point of distinction, such contentions appear to me to take issue with the correctness of the approach taken in SZJZB to the scope of s.424A of the Migration Act . I am of the view that it is not open to me to take such an approach in relation to the decision in SZJZB (cf SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 in which Jacobson J distinguished SZJZB at [19] on the basis that " the information in question was considered ... to be relevant by the Tribunal , either explicitly or by inference from the review process " (emphasis added)).  On this basis, in determining whether s.424A(1)(a) was enlivened I have considered what inferences can be drawn from the material available as to the Tribunal's state of mind at the anterior point or points of time as considered in SZLPJ and SZLJF , consistent with SZBYR at [17]. I note in that respect that as Jacobson J observed in SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 99 at [17] --- [18]: [17] The question of whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision must be a question of fact. As Siopis J observed in SZMFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1890 at [36] : [T]he assessment of whether the information enlivened the obligation on the Tribunal under s 424A(1) is made by reference to the time at which the Tribunal becomes aware of the information. Accordingly, and significantly, in light of the submission made by the first respondent, the assessment is not dependent upon the use that the Tribunal subsequently made of the information, although, in my view, that may be a relevant consideration in drawing inferences as to the proper characterisation of the information. [18] That is to say, in a proper case, the Court, in making its assessment, may draw inferences from the Tribunal's reasons as to whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FMCA 281">[29] Whether the Tribunal has attained that state of mind is a question of fact. It has been suggested that the Tribunal's reasons for decision are not the starting point in resolving the question; but, whether or not this is so, the question must be answered in the light of all the relevant evidence including the reasons. [30] In the present case, the only evidence of the Tribunal having become aware of the expiry of BSS's approval is a two-line paragraph in its reasons, noting that 'Departmental systems' showed the approval to have been granted for two years on 29 August 2006. [31] The point is not taken up in the Tribunal's reasoning. [32] Nor is there any other indication in the documents that the Tribunal: reached any final view about the accuracy of the departmental record (or asked for or received any of the documentation relating to BSS's approval); or analysed the consequences, for the purpose of the Applicant seeking to meet cl 457.223, of the period of BSS's approval having expired.</sentence>
