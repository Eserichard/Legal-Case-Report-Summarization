30 Item 4 raises the question of alternative proposals. Often the savings of cost and time can be achieved, without creating the procedural complexities that arise when formal consolidation is ordered, by ordering that the proceedings be heard together, and perhaps also the evidence in one be received as evidence in the other: see, for example, Thompson v HFA Asset Management Ltd [2008] FCA 1926. If two or more the proceedings raise a common question of law, while there are some different matters of facts, the court has power to make an order for separate determination of the question: UCPR 28.2; and see International Advisor Systems Pty Ltd v XYYX Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (No 3) [2008] NSWSC 430 , at [8] per Brereton J. 40 Fox v Olsen was a case in which orders were made that proceedings be heard together (not consolidated). More recently, in Thompson v HFA Asset Management Ltd [2008] FCA 1926 , at [6], Jagot J listed a series of obstacles to consolidation, including the issue of whether the applicants should be permitted to be represented separately, and concluded that "the Court could not be 'affirmatively satisfied' that the orders would not result in unfairness to [the relevant party]". Her Honour took the view that much of the prejudice that would arise from consolidation, including prejudice as regards separate representation of plaintiffs, would be avoided if the order was simply that the proceedings be heard together.</sentence>
