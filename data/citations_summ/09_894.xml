<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 225">The following principles were also submitted in Australian Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union v Rail Corporation New South Wales [2009] FCA 894 and adopted by Jagot J at [17]: "(a) Industrial instruments are not to be interpreted narrowly or pedantically: Kucks v CSR Ltd (1996) 66 IR 182 at 184 per Madgwick J . (b) The aim is to determine what meaning was intended by the framers, keeping in mind that they "were likely of a practical bent of mind": Kucks at 184. (c) It is necessary to have regard to the practical purpose of the instrument intended to be served by the parties and the context in which it was made: Kucks at 184. In this regard, Jagot J in dealing with an industrial agreement in Australian Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union v Rail Corporation New South Wales [2009] FCA 894 at [20] , applied the principle enunciated by Marshall J in respect of the interpretation of industrial awards in Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union v Treasurer of Commonwealth (1998) 82 FCR 175 at 178. That principle states that it is impermissible to have regard to the conduct of parties subsequent to the making of the award in interpreting an award. In the circumstances, I accept counsel for the applicant's submission that the conduct of the parties subsequent to the making of an agreement is entirely irrelevant in its interpretation: Ryan v Textile &amp; Footwear Union of Australia [1996] VicRp 67 ; (1996) 66 IR 258 at 285-286; Brambles Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council [2001] NSWCA 61 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 153 at [26] ; AWU v Pasminco Australia Ltd [2003] NSWIRComm 365 ; [2003] NSWIRComm 365 ; (2003) 131 IR 1 at [39] . 5.
