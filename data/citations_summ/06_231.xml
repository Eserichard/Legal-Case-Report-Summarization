<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] HCA 16">The approach to be derived from the emphasised statement had been foreshadowed in Minister for Immigration v Eshetu (" Eshetu ") where Gummow J referred to "findings or inferences of fact which were not supported by some probative material or logical grounds" [69] . The approach was also anticipated in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (" S 20 ") where Gleeson CJ noted that one of the grounds of challenge to the Tribunal's decision was that it "was illogical, irrational, or was not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds" [70] . It was said by the appellant that since S20 a range of views had emerged in the Federal Court as to whether an illogical process of reasoning in the course of reaching a conclusion of fact amounts to a jurisdictional error [71] .

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 911">This aspect of the Tribunal's reasoning may have been subject to the objection that the Tribunal should first have alerted the husband to the adverse inference which it might draw from his earlier silence. [12] Had such an argument been advanced by the appellants, it would, in my view, have been bound to fail. The Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence does not constitute 'information' for the purposes of s 424A of the Migration Act : see VWFP and VWFQ v The Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 231 at [70] . Furthermore, the Tribunal's rejection of the claim that a deliberate attempt had been made to harm the husband was founded on a range of additional considerations which, standing alone, would have supported the conclusion to which the Tribunal came : see reasons at paras [57] and [58].

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1918">17 Mr Estcourt QC for the appellant submitted in summary as follows:
 
&#8226; the conclusion of the Tribunal that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution because:
 
 
 o he was only an apostate and not a Christian proslytizer
 o he had not criticised the Islamic Revolutionary government since he first went to live in the United States 25 years ago
 o he only reached the "lowly" rank of airman in the United States Navy and therefore he would not be a person the authorities in Iran would have any interest in punishing 
 

was " Wednesbury unreasonable" and both irrational and illogical
 
&#8226; it was illogical in the extreme, perverse and manifestly wrong in the sense discussed by Young J in VWFP and VWFQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 231 to conclude that the Iranian authorities would examine the appellants Navy service records and satisfy themselves that they did not disclose that the appellant was any threat to Iran
 
&#8226; the Tribunals' conclusion in relation to the assertion that the appellant "can inform them that he was never properly rewarded for his study efforts in the navy" and other quantitative aspects of the appellants United States Navy serve was capricious, perverse and disclose manifest error going to jurisdiction
 
&#8226; it was not relevant how long the appellant served in the United States Navy, or the level of his rank, or whether he felt sufficiently rewarded or appreciated by the United States Navy to whether he would be of interest to the Iranian authorities. What would be of moment was the authorities' perception of the political conduct of an Iranian opponent of the current government who evaded military conscription in the service of his own country and fled to and joined the armed services of Iran's enemy
 
&#8226; the Tribunal's unreasonable approach failed to appreciate and decide upon the full import of the evidence before it concerning the position as to Iran
 
&#8226; given that the Tribunal found that the appellant would come to the attention of the authorities in Iran and that the legal sanction for apostasy is the death penalty, and given the appellants overall history, the chance of him suffering serious persecution was not one which could be discounted as "farfetched" "remote" or "insubstantial"
 
&#8226; the Tribunal failed to take into account the very relevant considerations of arbitrary arrest, imprisonment of people solely on account of their beliefs, torture and ill-treatment of detainees, the refusal of Iran to adopt laws against torture and the role of "morality forces" in attacking opponents of the regime to determine whether the appellant (who has 21 years of residence in the United States and served in the United States Navy) has a well-founded fear of persecution
 
&#8226; the Tribunal accepted the appellant's characterisation of the United States as Iran's "sworn enemy"
 
&#8226; to have concluded otherwise than that the appellant had more than a "remote", "insubstantial" or "farfetched" chance of a threat to his liberty or physical harassment or ill-treatment at the hands of the Iranian authorities was so totally unreasonable that no reasonable Tribunal could arrive at such a conclusion and it is an irrational and illogical conclusion not based on any evidence or findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds.

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FCA 792">12 Fourth alleged breach: The inability of the appellant to state at hearing in which month of 2003 the false charges were laid against him given the time frames stated in the protection visa application. The Federal Magistrate determined that this information was not covered by s 424A(1) as the Tribunal relied on lack of knowledge about the month the appellant knew of the false charges and not the false charges themselves. Referring to the decision of Young J in VWFP &amp; Anor v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 231 at [62] --- [63] His Honour held that, once information was given at hearing about the charges, it was apparent that the claims were vague and the answers were inconsistent.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FCA 516">24 The law as to what constitutes 'information' for the purposes of s 424A has recently been addressed by a Full Court in NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195. Young J (with whom Gyles and Stone JJ agreed) said:
 
 'The meaning of 'information' was considered in the context of s 424A(1) by Allsop J in SZEEU at 259-260 [204]-[205]: 
 

'The assessment whether the Tribunal has complied with s 424A(1) requires close attention to the reasons of the Tribunal, because it is the information that the Tribunal considers relevant that must be assessed in order to see whether, prior to the decision being made, it would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision. Information is that of which one is told or apprised; it is knowledge communicated concerning some particular fact, subject or event: The Complete Oxford English Dictionary (2 nd Ed 1991). In this context, the word has been taken as referring to knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to, or received by, the Tribunal: Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 at [3] , approved in VAF at [24] or knowledge which has come to, or has been gained by, the Tribunal: Paul at [95]. '
 
 
 In contrast with the above, the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations are not information for the purposes of s 424A: Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 at [54] , Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 ('Paul') at 428 [95] per Allsop J and VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 ; (2004) 206 ALR 471 ('VAF') at 476-477 [24] per Finn and Stone JJ. The concept of information does not extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps: WAGP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 266 ; (2002) 124 FCR 276 at 282 [26] - [27]. The distinction between 'information' that is part of the Tribunal's reason on one hand, and 'subjective appraisals', 'thought processes' and 'determinations' of the Tribunal on the other hand, may be plain in some cases, but in other cases it may prove to be very fine, if not elusive: Paul at 428 [95]; VWFP and VWFQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 231 [36] ('VWFP') . 
 
 It is not necessary that the information is integral to the Tribunal's reasoning process; s 424A(1) is enlivened even if the information forms only a minor or subsidiary part of the Tribunal's reason for affirming the decision under review: SZEEU at 252 [158] per Weinberg J and at 262 [215] per Allsop J; and SAAP at 179-180 [68] and 184-185 [83] per McHugh J, 203 [173] per Kirby J and 211 [208] per Hayne J.
