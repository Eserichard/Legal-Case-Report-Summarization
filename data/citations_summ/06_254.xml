<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 481">the draft Personal Insolvency Agreement [16] is in the interests of creditors; the draft Personal Insolvency Agreement requires revision to best serve the interests of creditors; or bankruptcy, or the ceasing of the controlling trustees' control of the Debtor's property, would be better alternatives. [17] In all the circumstances, the controlling trustees consider that an additional six to eight weeks is necessary to fully consider all of these issues. [18] Grounds for extension of time application
 The grounds for the extension of time application are those set out in the Affidavit summarised above. Power to extend time
 The power to extend time for purposes including the s.194 meeting of creditors, is a power vested in this Court under s.33(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act . That power has been referred to and upheld in 
 Re Gowing; Ex parte Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy , [19] Application of Melvyn Malcolm Posner [20] and Application by Benjamin Peter Piggott. [21] As Pretorius v Daltons Carpet Tiles Pty Ltd, [22] Council of the New South Wales Bar Association v Eddy [23] and Piggott make clear, it is only under s.33(1)(c) that time for a meeting of creditors under s.194 can be validly extended. Exercise of discretion
 In terms of the exercise of the discretion to extend time, no criteria for extending the time for a meeting of creditors under s.194 is set out in the Bankruptcy Act . In the Court's view, it is appropriate to apply principles similar to those ordinarily applied by courts in determining whether to extend time, namely to have regard to: the fact that relevant time limits ought not be lightly ignored; the length of the delay and whether there is an acceptable reason for the delay; the merit of the substantive matter; and whether there is prejudice suffered by an affected party. [24] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 67">The power to extend time is vested in this Court under s.33(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act , and includes generally the power to extend time for the required meeting of creditors under s.194 of the Bankruptcy Act . [6] And, it is only under s.33(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act that time for a meeting of creditors under s.194 of the Bankruptcy Act can be validly extended. [7] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 23">various intermittently imposed property use (i.e. prohibited operation of machinery or vehicles) or access bans attributable to fire risks, 
have resulted in the controlling trustee's investigations being delayed. [5] 
 Grounds for extension of time application
 The grounds for the extension of time application are set out in the Affidavit as follows: I seek an extension of time for the holding of the first Meeting of Creditors to enable me to: (a) Make such enquiries and investigation in connection with the Debtor's property and examinable affairs as I consider necessary (Section 190(2)(b)) and in accordance with my duties as Controlling Trustee (Section 190A(f)) ; and (b) Deal with the Debtor's property in any way that will, in my opinion, be in the interests of creditors (Section 190(2)(d)) , given the number of issues and complexities concerning the Debtor's affairs in this regard . [6] Power to extend time
 The power to extend time vested in this Court is a power under s.33(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act to extend time for purposes including the s.194 meeting of creditors; that power has been referred to and upheld in Re Gowing; Ex parte Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy , [7] Application of Malcolm Melvyn Posner [8] and Application by Benjamin Peter Piggott. [9] As Pretorius v Daltons Carpet Tiles Pty Ltd, [10] Council of the New South Wales Bar Association v Eddy [11] and Piggott make clear, it is only under s.33(1)(c) that time for a meeting of creditors under s.194 can be validly extended. Exercise of discretion
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1061">the controlling trustee subsequently on 17 and 18 September 2009 received seemingly conflicting advice concerning the validity of the meeting of creditors held on 9 September 2009. The Court infers that as a consequence of that conflicting advice received by the controlling trustee it was necessary to make the present application which was made on 25 September 2009. Grounds for extension of time application
 The grounds for the extension of time application are set out in the controlling trustee's affidavit sworn 25 September 2009, as follows: (a) The date fixed for the holding of the meeting of creditors was solely as a result of an error of calculation on my part and had nothing whatsoever to do with either the Debtor, or the creditors; (b) The date fixed for the holding of the said meeting was outside the time limit by only one day and in these circumstances it is respectfully submitted that there has been "substantial compliance" with the requirements of Part X of the Bankruptcy Act ; (c) The resolution passed by the creditors at the meeting of creditors was unanimous in adopting the Debtor's proposal as set out in the Personal Insolvency Agreement subsequently executed; (d) A further resolution was passed at the meeting of creditors (unanimously and without objection) that despite the meeting being held outside the required time period prescribed by Section 194 , it was still being held at a time, date and place that was convenient to a majority of creditors (in accordance with Section 64Q of the Bankruptcy Act ); and (e) None of the creditors at the said meeting nor have any creditors to date raised any objection to the fact that the meeting was being held one day outside the requisite time period under Section 194. [2] Power to extend time
 The power to extend time vested in this Court is a power under s.33(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act to extend time for purposes including the s.194 meeting of creditors; that power has been referred to and upheld in Re Gowing; Ex parte Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy [3] and in Application of Malcolm Melvyn Posner . [4] In Pretorius v Daltons Carpet Tiles Pty Ltd , [5] the appellants sought to argue that an authority under s.188 of the Bankruptcy Act had a continuing operation enabling the time limits in s.194 to be fulfilled. The Full Court of the Federal Court unanimously held that the time limits established by s.194 for the calling of a meeting of creditors can only be extended by an order made under s.33(1)(c).
