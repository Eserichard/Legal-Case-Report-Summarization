<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 405">The s.359A letter is not such as to indicate a reasonable apprehension of bias. It does not suggest that the Tribunal member had already made up his mind to affirm the decision of the delegate at that time (see SZKBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 317 ; (2008) 101 ALD 61). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 51">Nor are the reasons for decision such as to establish apprehended bias in the sense considered in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 75 ALJR 982 (at [27]), from the perspective of the properly informed, fair-minded lay observer. The Tribunal findings and conclusions, as set out above, were open to it on the material before it for the reasons it gave. It has not been established that the Tribunal's fact-finding was conducted in a manner which could result in a reasonable apprehension of bias in the sense of a failure to bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided. The Tribunal's fact-finding was not unreasoned or mere assertion lacking reasoned foundation such as was considered in NADH of 2001 and Others v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 (and see SZEOQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 257). It gave reasons in relation to its findings about the weight to be given to supporting evidence (cf SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 101 ALD 295). The s.424A letter was not expressed in terms indicative of a " closed mind " (cf SZKBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 317 ; (2008) 101 ALD 61). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 857">The Tribunal' s s.424A letter was not expressed in terms which demonstrated that a fair minded and informed person might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal member would not bring an impartial mind to bear (cf SZKBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 317). I note in that respect that as Cowdroy J stated in SZBLY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 765 ; (2007) 96 ALD 70 at [25] (and see SZKBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 317 at [26] per Cowdroy J): " Because of the inquisitorial nature of Tribunal proceedings, the threshold for a finding of apprehended bias is necessarily higher than it is in curial proceedings" (and see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v MZXPA [2008] FCA 185 ; (2008) 100 ALD 312). Alerting the applicant to the fact that an adverse inference " may " be drawn is not indicative of prejudgment or such as to establish a " reasonable " apprehension of bias from the perspective of the hypothetical fair-minded and informed person ( Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v MZXPA [2008] FCA 185 ; (2008) 100 ALD 312 at [11] --- [19] per Sundberg J).  The Tribunal' s s.424A letter was not expressed in terms which demonstrated that a fair minded and informed person might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal member would not bring an impartial mind to bear (cf SZKBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 317). I note in that respect that as Cowdroy J stated in SZBLY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 765 ; (2007) 96 ALD 70 at [25] (and see SZKBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 317 at [26] per Cowdroy J): " Because of the inquisitorial nature of Tribunal proceedings, the threshold for a finding of apprehended bias is necessarily higher than it is in curial proceedings" (and see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v MZXPA [2008] FCA 185 ; (2008) 100 ALD 312).
