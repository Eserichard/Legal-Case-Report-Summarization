<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 94">The provisions of the Act dealing with the review of services provided by medical practitioners has received, perhaps not surprisingly, repeated judicial attention: e.g., Daniel v Kelly [2003] FCA 772 , 200 ALR 379 ; Kelly v Daniel [2004] FCAFC 14 , 134 FCR 64 ; Mathews v Health Insurance Commission [2006] FCA 195 , 90 ALD 49 ; Phan v Kelly [2007] FCA 269 , 158 FCR 75. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1025">The applicant's submissions on grounds 4 and 5 also assume --- incorrectly --- that if the Committee fails to make a change to a draft report that has been suggested to it, the Court would be entitled to infer that the Committee did not take the submissions into account, and the fair-minded lay person would be entitled to infer that the Committee closed its mind to the submissions. See Mathews v Health Insurance Commission [2006] FCA 195 ; (2006) 90 ALD 49 at [32] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 987">177 Further or alternatively, Dr Saint contended "as in Mathews v HIC [2006] FCA 195 ; (2006) 90 ALD 49 ( Mathews ) the selection of the first services from the preliminary sample meant that those services were not randomly chosen from that preliminary sample". It followed, said Dr Saint, that the final report was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 984">75 A submission to the same effect was 'rejected out of hand' by Edmonds J in Mathews v Health Insurance Commission [2006] FCA 195 ; (2006) 90 ALD 49 at [40] . It is appropriate for me to follow the approach adopted by his Honour unless I am satisfied that his Honour was in error. I am not so satisfied. Indeed, in my respectful view, his Honour was plainly correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 269">49 To support his position, Dr Phan has referred to the decision of Edmonds J in Mathews v Health Insurance Commission [2006] FCA 195 ; (2006) 90 ALD 49. In that case, his Honour decided that the Committee had erred in its sampling by failing to examine samples randomly drawn from a preliminary random sample as required by Health Insurance (Professional Services Review - Sampling Methodology) Determination 2000 (No. 1) ("the Determination"). The breach considered by his Honour was clear. The case was decided on the basis that the Committee had examined the first 30 services on lists of the first 40 services taken from lists of random samples furnished by the Commission. They were not therefore 'randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample' as required by s 8(a) of the Determination. </sentence>
