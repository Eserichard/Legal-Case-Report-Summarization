<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 451">The applicants submitted that the court's discretion should be exercised under O.29 r.5 on the basis that it was desirable to make the order sought for the effective administration of justice and use of the court's time and resources (see Lord v Agreserves Australia Limited ACN 080 646 251 [2006] FCA 598). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 457">It is not in dispute that the court has the power to make the orders sought pursuant to O.29 r.5 of the Federal Court Rules (which is applicable by virtue of r.1.05(2) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules (see Calmer Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Michel's Patisserie (WA) Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 42). Order 29 rule 5 provides: Where several proceedings are pending in the Court, then, if it appears to the Court: (a) that some common question of law or fact arises in both or all of them; (b) that the rights to relief claimed therein are in respect of, or arise out of, the same transaction or series of transactions; or (c) that for some other reason it is desirable to make an order under this rule; the Court may order those proceedings to be consolidated or may order them to be tried at the same time or one immediately after another or may order them to be stayed until after the determination of any of them. The applicants submitted that the court's discretion should be exercised under O.29 r.5 on the basis that it was desirable to make the order sought for the effective administration of justice and use of the court's time and resources (see Lord v Agreserves Australia Limited ACN 080 646 251 [2006] FCA 598). As Hill J noted in Re Ling; Ex Parte Ling v Commonwealth of Australia [1995] FCA 1410 ; (1995) 58 FCR 129 at 134; [1995] FCA 1410 at [18], an order for consolidation is not limited to the circumstances expressed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of O.29 r.5. It suffices that it is " desirable" that an order for consolidation should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1129">The Court's task in giving leave is to identify the advantages and the disadvantages to the parties as a whole in terms of the efficient use of the Court's resources, having regard to the commonality of issues raised by each claim and to the Court's ability to case manage the proceedings so as to minimise disadvantages: Lord v AgReserves Australia Ltd (2006) FCA 598. </sentence>
