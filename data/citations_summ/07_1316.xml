<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 1438">23 In this respect, the circumstances of this case are relevantly the same as (or similar to) those considered in a number of earlier cases including, in particular, Re Charter Hall Ltd [2007] FCA 1316 , Re Diversified United Investment Ltd [2008] FCA 720 , Re A J Lucas Group Ltd [2008] FCA 999 , Re Chameleon Mining NL [2009] NSWSC 660 and Re Chalice Gold Mines Ltd [2009] FCA 1236. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 687">Only one of the three sub-paras in s 1322(6) (a) needs to be satisfied in order to grant an order under s 1322(4): Re Charter Hall Ltd [2007] FCA 1316 at [7] ; Re MLC Ltd [2006] FCA 1357 ; (2006) 60 ACSR 187 ; Primelife Corp Ltd v Aevum Ltd (2005) 53 ACSR 283 at [8]; Re Westpac Banking Corporation [2004] FCA 1792 ; (2004) 53 ACSR 288 at [27] ; Jordan v Avram (1997) 141 FLR 275 at 281. The sub-paragraphs are disjunctive and not cumulative: Re Charter Hall Ltd at [7]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 40">It is sufficient that Golden Gate meet any one of the three criteria in s 1322(6)(a) CA: Re Charter Hall Ltd [2007] FCA 1316 at [7] ; Primelife Corporation Ltd v Aevum Ltd (2005) 53 ACSR 283 at [8] and [16]; Re Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1940 ; (2005) 57 ACSR 28 at [21] ; Re Westpac Banking Corporation [2004] FCA 1792 ; (2004) 53 ACSR 288 at [27] ; Jordan v Avram (1997) 141 FLR 275 at 281. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] NSWSC 1220">28 The current situation is close to that dealt with by Gyles J in Re Charter Hall [2007] FCA 1316 although there is one important difference; likewise the decision of White J in Re Chameleon Mining NL [2009] NSWSC 660 which generally followed Charter Hall is to similar effect: cf Re Chalice Gold Mines Ltd [2009] FCA 1236. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1236">The declaratory relief sought by Chalice under s 1322(4)(a) of the Act to the effect that a Notice given under s 708A(5)(e) of the Act within the extended period be deemed to take effect as if it had been given within the period of five business days from 10 September 2009, that is, within the required five business day period, is consistent with relief granted in the matters of Charter Hall Limited, in the matter of Charter Hall Limited [2007] FCA 1316 , Diversified, in the matter of Diversified United Investment Limited ACN 006 713 177 [2008] FCA 720 and In the Matter of Chameleon Mining NL [2009] NSWSC 660. It also gives clarity for those affected shareholders (the Placees) who on-sold the relevant securities prior to the lodgement of a Notice which complies with the section and thereby to any purchaser from them. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1130">The declaratory relief sought by RCR under s 1322(4)(a) CA to the effect that a notice given under s 708A(5)(e) CA within the extended period be deemed to take effect as if it had been given on 13 July 2009, that is, within the required five business day period, is consistent with relief granted in the matters of Charter Hall Limited, in the matter of Charter Hall Limited [2007] FCA 1316 , Diversified, in the matter of Diversified United Investment Limited ACN 006 713 177 [2008] FCA 720 and In the Matter of Chameleon Mining NL [2009] NSWSC 660. It also gives clarity for those affected shareholders (the Placees) who on-sold the relevant securities prior to the lodgement of a notice which complies with the section and thereby to any purchaser from them. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] NSWSC 660">12 It is theoretically possible that a purchaser of shares from an allottee of the shares might contend that the purchase would not have been made had the seller complied with its obligations of disclosure. Any potential for injustice can, I think, be accommodated by giving liberty to any person who may claim to have suffered substantial injustice by reason of the making of an order extending the time for compliance with s 708A(6) to apply to vary or discharge the orders within a limited period (see Re Chartered Hall Limited [2007] FCA 1316 at [11] ; Re Diversified United Investment Limited [2008] FCA 720 at [9] ; and Re AJ Lucas Group Limited [2008] FCA 999 at [7] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 720">7 In Charter Hall Limited, in the matter of Charter Hall Limited ("Charter Hall") [2007] FCA 1316 , Gyles J considered a similar application and described the relevant provisions and resolution of the issue in the following terms:
 
 
 3. The purpose of the provisions in question is to ensure that, where what might be called the prospectus obligations in relation to the issue of securities are sidestepped by reason of appropriate circumstances, the purchasers of such securities receive the same relevant level of disclosure as might have been achieved by other means but without the more stringent and costly requirements of a prospectus and prospectus type provisions. 4.</sentence>
