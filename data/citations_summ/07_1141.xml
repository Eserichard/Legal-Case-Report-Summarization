<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1451">The Court will not simply apply an arbitrary discount. As a matter of outcome, leaving aside the 50% discount awarded in Lundbeck , other cost decisions disclose that very often the discount is not that large. See Stena Rederi Aktiebolag v Austal Ships Sales Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1141 at [11] ; R anbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner-Lambert Company LLC (No 3) [2006] FCA 1797 at [2] - [10]; Doric Products Pty Ltd v Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 282 ; (2002) 54 IPR 495 at 499, Patent Gesellschaft AG v Saudi Livestock Transport &amp; Trading Co (1996) 33 IPR 461 at 463-465, E I Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co v Imperial Chemical Industries PLC [2002] FCA 459 ; NutraSweet Australia Pty Ltd v Ajinomoto Co., Inc. (No 2) [2005] FCA 1907 ; c/f Ajinomoto Co Inc v NutraSweet Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCAFC 55. See also generally the Full Court (Emmett, Stone &amp; Bennett JJ) decision in JMVB Enterprises (Formerly A'Van Campers Pty Ltd) v Camoflag Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCAFC 6 at [8] . In some circumstances, however, the Court has held that the successful party (for example, the alleged patent infringer) should pay the unsuccessful party's costs on a particular issue (for example, the patentee's costs of a cross-claim relating to allegations of lack of novelty, lack of inventive step and false suggestion) because that party has not succeeded on the cross-claim in respect of those issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 306">21 It has been said that the discretion to apportion costs is one to be exercised only in the most exceptional of circumstances ( Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Limited (No 3) (1979) 28 ALR 201 ; (1979) 42 FLR 213 ; (1979) ATPR 40-141) and, as noted above, in Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 , at 12, Jacobs J recognised the need for the court to be mindful not to discourage litigants from canvassing all material issues for fear of an adverse costs order (and see Stena Rederi Aktiblag v Austal Ships Sales Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1141 , at [12]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 920">SBriggs contends that while a successful litigant is ordinarily entitled to an award of costs on the footing that costs follow the event ( Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72) , the ordinary application of the rule may well lead to an order for costs according to each party's success on the claim in relation to which costs were incurred ( Hansen Beverage Company v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2008] FCA 601) and a successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered to pay the other party's costs of them: Ruddock v Vadarlis (No. 2) . Thus, costs, it is said, should be allocated according to each party's success on their respective claims or alternatively in relation to issues arising in particular claims. An allocation of costs according to issues is said to be particularly appropriate in complex commercial litigation and particularly in patent suits: Stena Rederi Aktiebolag v Austal Ships Sales Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1141. This approach is said to be particularly important in intellectual property cases: Windsurfing International Inc. v Petit (1987) AIPC 90-441 ; Doric Products Pty Ltd v Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 282 ; Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCAFC 172 ; and JVMB Enterprises Pty Ltd v Camoflag Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCAFC 6. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] NSWLEC 235">Nevertheless he accepted that where a considerable part of the trial is taken up in determining issues upon which a party fails, it is a proper exercise of the discretion to reduce the costs allowed to that party. Generally speaking, and notwithstanding the considerations referred to by Toohey J and the other authorities mentioned above, the demands of the community for greater economy and efficiency in the conduct of litigation may properly be reflected in a qualification of the presumption that a successful party is entitled to all its costs. 17 Similarly, in Stena Rederi Aktiebolag v Austal Ships Sales Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1141 at [12] Tamberlin J commented that: When apportioning costs, however, a Court should be mindful not to discourage litigants from canvassing all material issues for fear of an adverse costs order...Equally, litigants should not be rewarded for the injudicious pursuit of issues without substance .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 601">3 As Tamberlin J observed in Stena [2007] FCA 1141 at [11] , an 'issues' approach can be adopted in certain cases:
 Although courts have in the past been inclined to take a broad approach by looking at the substance of the overall outcome and have been reluctant to exercise discretion to apportion costs according to parties' success or failure on particular issues (see Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Limited (No 3) (1979) 28 ALR 201 at 208), recent authorities accept that in complex commercial matters, and particularly in patent suits where there are numerous issues, the discretion may be exercised to apportion costs concomitant with the parties' respective success or failure on certain issues: JMVB Enterprises (Formerly A'Van Campers Pty Ltd) v Camoflag Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCAFC 6 at 7; and see James v Surf Road Nominees Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 296 at [34] .  2 In the ordinary course costs would follow the event and, accordingly, Hansen would pay Bickfords' costs of the claim and Bickfords would pay Hansen's costs of the cross-claim: see eg Stena Rederi Aktiebolag v Austal Ships Sales Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1141 at [10] .  18 As to the time spent on objections to admissibility of affidavit evidence, in many instances objections taken by Bickfords were unsuccessful. However, some objections taken were successful, and Hansen was given the opportunity during the trial to mend its hand. In particular, Bickfords' objections to Mr Alford's evidence were successful, which took up a significant part of the hearing and submissions. Nevertheless, I have come to the view that this is not a case where Bickfords was involved in 'the injudicious pursuit of issues without substance' (see eg Stena [2007] FCA 1141 at [12] ) or was involved in any unreasonable or inappropriate conduct (see eg BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (No 2) [2007] FCA 557 at [18] ). In this proceeding the evidence and its presentation were important, and Bickfords was entitled to take the objections, although some were not upheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] NSWLEC 121">17 Consistent with the respondents' submissions, I am not satisfied that any apportionment of costs of the class 2 or class 4 proceedings is appropriate. The bulk of the time taken by the proceedings was not the result of the respondents' defences but, rather, the applicant's need to adduce evidence in both sets of proceedings to found the claims for the relief sought. That evidence involved a complicated history of development consents, modifications, appeals to the Court about development consents and modifications, amended plans and proposals and the like. The respondents' defences in the class 4 proceedings primarily arose from the applicant's own evidence and were interlinked with the class 2 proceedings. In short, any grant of relief to the applicant in the class 2 proceedings depended on the validity and enforceability of the contract. Any grant of relief to the applicant in the class 4 proceedings assumed the time for completion of the development scheme under the contract would be deferred. The respondents' defences, accordingly, were not separable. A costs order in the respondents' favour would properly accord with the compensatory purpose of such orders and would not reward the respondents for any "injudicious pursuit of issues without substance" ( Stena Rederi Aktiebolag v Austal Ships Sales Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1141 at [12] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] NSWLEC 552">21 Similarly, in Stena Rederi Aktiebolag v Austal Ships Sales Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1141 at [12] Tamberlin J commented that: " When apportioning costs, however, a Court should be mindful not to discourage litigants from canvassing all material issues for fear of an adverse costs order...Equally, litigants should not be rewarded for the injudicious pursuit of issues without substance ".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] NSWLEC 569">17 Similarly, in Stena Rederi Aktiebolag v Austal Ships Sales Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1141 at [12] Tamberlin J commented that: " When apportioning costs, however, a Court should be mindful not to discourage litigants from canvassing all material issues for fear of an adverse costs order...Equally, litigants should not be rewarded for the injudicious pursuit of issues without substance ".
