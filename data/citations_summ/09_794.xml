<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 318">Such an application is confined to a question of law pursuant to s 44 of the AAT Act . Besanko J considered the 44 grounds of appeal put forward by Mr Kowalski and dismissed them all; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794. His Honour found that 35 of the 44 grounds did not raise questions of law and the errors alleged in the other nine grounds could not be made out. His Honour dismissed the application on 30 July 2009.  His Honour held, at [23], that he had not made any findings of fact in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 because the nature of the appeal and its merits meant that he was not required to make findings of fact. His Honour added, however, that he had dealt with facts found by the Tribunal, and "at least one of those facts is in issue in the present proceeding". His Honour held that "in view of a common factual background and the matters the appellant seeks to agitate" it was appropriate that he disqualify himself. Given that conclusion it was not necessary for his Honour to consider the other decision in issue.  Ms Bochner also provided "a chronological summary of the corresponding Federal Court decisions in relation to proceedings instituted by the Respondent". She lists 33 decisions in respect of which written reasons were given. I have added another decision (number 34) that was relied upon by the applicants and discussed in their submissions although not listed in Ms Bochner's affidavit. The citations for those decisions and other relevant details are as follows: Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd (1998) FCR 55 , SG 100 of 1997, 16 October 1998; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1153 , SAD 190 of 2001, 17 September 2002; Kowalski v Trustee of Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 14 , SAD 234 of 2002, 15 January 2003; Kowalski v Trustee, Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 18 , SAD 234 of 2002, 28 February 2003; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1069 , (2000) 242 ALR 370 SAD 11 of 2007, 24 July 2007; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 691 , SAD 11 of 2007, 20 May 2008; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2008] FCA 1873 , SAD 171 of 2008, 4 December 2008; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1970 , SAD 168 of 2008, 22 December 2008; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 47 , SAD 216 of 2008, 30 January 2009; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 48 , SAD 205 of 2008, 3 February 2009; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 153 , SAD 3 of 2009, 27 February 2009; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 , SAD 168 of 2008, 30 July 2009; Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCAFC 107, (2009) 259 ALR 444 ; SAD 26 of 2009, 14 August 2009; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 , SAD 171 of 2008, 3 September 2009; Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 117 , (2009) 259 ALR 319 ; SAD 20 of 2009, 9 September 2009; Kowalski v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2009] FCA 1044 , SAD 75 of 2009, 17 September 2009; Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia [2009] FCA 1072 , SAD 81 of 2009, 23 September 2009; Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 1289 , SAD 133 of 2009, 9 November 2009; Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia [2009] FCA 1420 , SAD 165 of 2009, 2 December 2009;  The events which began the respondent's long history of litigation began with his employment with Mitsubishi (then Chrysler Australia Limited) commencing on 16 January 1964. The respondent initially was employed as a fitter and turner. In the next few years he qualified as a mechanical technician (1969) and as a draftsman (1970). On 20 April 1972 Mr Kowalski joined the Australian Military Forces where he served as a regimental and mechanical draftsman until 19 October 1973; see Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 at [2] --- [4].  In an interlocutory application Mr Kowalski applied to Besanko J for his Honour to disqualify himself from involvement in the application for judicial review. Besanko J rejected any suggestion of actual bias but agreed to disqualify himself because of his involvement in other proceedings: Kowalski v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2009] FCA 1044. His Honour said that the question was whether by reason of either or both of his decisions in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 (see [85] above) and Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 (see [95] above) he should disqualify himself from further participation in the proceeding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 73">26 The proceedings involving Mitsubishi are quite separate from proceedings the applicant has brought against the Repatriation Commission, but in the Repatriation Commission proceedings, an application that Besanko J should disqualify himself in those proceedings was dismissed: Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 19"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 104">I recognise that the present appeal is limited to an appeal on a question of law, although this Court may make findings of fact in certain circumstances. To my mind, the question of whether I should disqualify myself in the present proceeding is borderline, but, in view of a common factual background and the matters the appellant seeks to agitate, I think it is appropriate that I do so. 
 

 
There was a particular fact in issue in that matter, which might possibly have exposed his Honour to confronting a finding that he had accepted, and in which he had proceeded in an earlier decision in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 , which may have arisen in the subsequent proceeding. The subsequent proceeding has since been heard by another judge, but judgment has not yet been delivered. Neither proceeding included an issue whether the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, by finding that it did not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the applicant's complaint, erred in law. Finally, the applicant asserted that, because Besanko J had disqualified himself from hearing a particular matter by judgment given on 17 September 2009: Kowalski v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2009] FCA 1044 , his Honour should not now hear any further proceedings involving the applicant. The reason that his Honour disqualified himself in that matter is explained in [23] of the decision where his Honour said: 
 
 I recognise that I did not make any findings of fact in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794. The nature of the appeal and the merits meant that I was not required to do that. Nevertheless, I dealt with the matter, having regard to facts found by Deputy President Jarvis and at least one of those facts is in issue in the present proceeding. Secondly, the applicant argued before Besanko J that his Honour should disqualify himself because, on 22 December 2008, he had refused to adjourn a different proceeding whilst the applicant sought leave to appeal from his Honour's refusal to disqualify himself from deciding that matter, and then subsequently had decided adversely to the applicant. The respondent in that matter was the Repatriation Commission. Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1970 is the judgment dealing with the disqualification application, and Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 is the final decision. Neither of those decisions involved a question of law as to the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and neither is in any sense indicative of his Honour having possibly made up his mind on the question of law which arises in the principal proceeding. The applicant also said the order for costs made against him, as the unsuccessful litigant, when judgment was delivered in that matter also indicated prejudgement because he was not present at the time. Besanko J rejected that 'contention. ' His Honour noted that the applicant was notified of the time and place for the delivery of judgment but did not attend. That is not a reason for considering that his Honour would not apply an independent mind to the principal proceeding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1466">I heard the appeal in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission on 22 January 2009. I heard applications in Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors on 16 March 2009. I delivered my decision in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission on 30 July 2009: Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794. I conducted a further hearing of the applications in Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors on 18 August 2009.  Mr Kowalski asked me to disqualify myself in Kowalski v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission (SAD 75 of 2009) ("Kowalski v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission"). I disqualified myself in that appeal and I delivered reasons for my decision on 17 September 2009: Kowalski v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2009] FCA 1044. In the course of my reasons I said (at [23]): 
 
 "I recognise that I did not make any findings of fact in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794. The nature of the appeal and the merits meant that I was not required to do that. Nevertheless, I dealt with the matter, having regard to facts found by Deputy President Jarvis and at least one of those facts is in issue in the present proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1044">As a judge of this Court, I have sat on two cases involving the applicant. They were Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 (SAD 168 of 2008) and Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 (SAD 171 of 2008).  After I had delivered judgment in the appeal in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794 , but before I had delivered judgment in Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited (SAD 171 of 2008), the applicant again asked me to disqualify myself. I again declined to do so and I proceeded to deliver judgment in the matter of Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd [2009] FCA 991 at [7]- [12].  I recognise that I did not make any findings of fact in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794. The nature of the appeal and the merits meant that I was not required to do that. Nevertheless, I dealt with the matter, having regard to facts found by Deputy President Jarvis and at least one of those facts is in issue in the present proceeding. I recognise that the present appeal is limited to an appeal on a question of law, although this Court may make findings of fact in certain circumstances. To my mind, the question of whether I should disqualify myself in the present proceeding is borderline, but, in view of a common factual background and the matters the appellant seeks to agitate, I think it is appropriate that I do so.  I dismissed the appeal from the decision of the Tribunal constituted by Deputy President Jarvis: Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 991">That contention is untenable. Having determined that there were no grounds upon which I should disqualify myself, it was appropriate that I proceed to hear and determine the appeal in the substantive proceeding. I have since delivered judgment in that proceeding in which I dismissed the applicant's appeal: Kowalski v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 794. The applicant claims that that is a further ground upon which I should disqualify myself in this proceeding because in dismissing his appeal in the proceeding involving the Repatriation Commission I have "fabricated [my] decision". That contention is also untenable.</sentence>
