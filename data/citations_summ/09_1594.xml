<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 497">Here, in our view, some of the Commissioner's criticisms are somewhat pedantic and do not really go to matters of substance. The first criticism is that the date of valuation is the incorrect date and undertakes a valuation prior to the introduction of GST. We do not regard that, without more, as being of any particular significance and we may ignore it. In the absence of any suggestion of an event that might affect valuation, a valuation as at 1 July 2000 can be regarded as also representing a valuation as at 30 June 2000. Some of the other criticisms warrant similar comment. For example, the certificate regarding Tower Two does not use the term "the market value of the completed premises"; rather it uses the expression "completed market value". We think it safe to regard a value said to be the "completed market value" of an apartment tower to be the same as the "market value of the completed premises". While the terminology used in the documents prepared by the valuer might be loose, or contain valuer's' jargon, taking technical points is not consistent with the approach the authorities dictate is required in relation to the construction to be afforded to, and the administrative approach to be adopted for, GST laws --- a practical common sense approach consistent with the tax being a business tax. The decision of Greenwood J in Meridien Marinas Horizon Shores Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [12] notes this approach to the GST Act and the earlier authorities to the same effect. </sentence>
