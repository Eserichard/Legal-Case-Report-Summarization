<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 657">In any event, of course, Mansfield J considered the appeal and the decision of Cameron FM. It appears to me, with respect, that his Honour's judgment contains a comprehensive examination of the decision in the Federal Magistrates Court. I note that his Honour went on to give independent consideration saying: 
 "I have also independently considered whether there is some other basis upon which the appellant might have demonstrated jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. " [4] 
 
His Honour went on to consider the various issues and dismissed the appeal. </sentence>
