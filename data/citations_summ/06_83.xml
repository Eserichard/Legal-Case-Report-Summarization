 Principles applying on sentencing for contempt 
 
 5 The considerations relevant to determining an appropriate penalty include the following: [4] 
 
 (a) the contemnor's personal circumstances; 
 (b) the nature and circumstances of the contempt; 
 (c) the actual consequences of the contempt; 
 (d) the effect of the contempt on the administration of justice; 
 (e) the contemnor's culpability; 
 (f) the need to deter the contemnor and others from repeating the contempt; 
 (g) the contemnor's reasons for his or her conduct; 
 (h) the absence or presence of a prior conviction for contempt; 
 (i) the contemnor's financial means; and 
 (j) whether the contemnor has exhibited general contrition and made a full and ample apology.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 557">The considerations relevant to the determination of an appropriate penalty for contempt of court were discussed by the High Court in Mudginberri Station .

The primary judge adopted that analysis, but it is not apparent to me that he applied it, at least in one important respect. Relevantly, Merkel J identified the following in relation to the question of imprisonment: 
 
 Imprisonment
 1.8 It is widely accepted that the court should only impose a term of imprisonment in the most serious criminal contempt cases: Keeley v Justice Brooking [1979] HCA 28 ; (1979) 143 CLR 162 at 179; Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238. 1.9 In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Hickey [1999] FCA 259 [(1999) 42 ATR 229] , Carr J held that imprisonment is a "last resort": see also R v Vasin (1985) 39 SASR 45 ; James (1985) 14 A Crim R 364 ; Skipper (1992) 64 A Crim R 260.

 (1) The contemnor's personal circumstances including the contemnor's financial circumstances; 
 

 
 
 (2) The nature and circumstances of the contempt; 
 

 
 
 (3) The effect of the contempt on the administration of justice; 
 

 
 
 (4) The contemnor's culpability; 
 

 
 
 (5) The need to deter the contemnor and others from repeating the contempt; 
 

 
 
 (6) The absence or presence of a prior conviction for contempt. Other criminal history is irrelevant; and 
 

 
 
 (7) Whether genuine contrition has been shown and a full and ample apology proffered.

 It was common ground between the parties that the following factors, ..., are relevant to penalty. 
 

 
 
 
 1.5 In deciding the appropriate penalty, a court should consider the following factors: 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 (1) contemnor's personal circumstances; 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 (2) nature and circumstances of the contempt: R v West Australian Newspapers Ltd; Ex Parte DPP (WA) (1996) 16 WAR 518 ; 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 (3) effect of the contempt on the administration of justice: Durack v Gallagher (1982) 44 ALR 272 at 286-7; 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 (4) contemnor's culpability: Durack v Gallagher (1982) 44 ALR 272 at 286-7; 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 (5) need to deter the contemnor and others from repeating contempt: DPP v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd (1987) 8 NSWLR 732 , Kirby P at 741; and 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 (6) absence or presence of a prior conviction for contempt: Attorney-General (NSW) v Macquarie Publications Pty Ltd (1988) 40 A Crim R 405 at 410. However, other criminal history is irrelevant: R v Giscombe (1984) 79 Cr App R 79 at 84.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 1125">The Bulzomi Interests conceded that the failure to comply with a court order is what, in the past, has been described as a civil contempt: Witham at 530. At least to some extent the distinction between civil and criminal contempt has been made superfluous by the High Court adopting a "beyond reasonable doubt" standard of proof for both: Witham at 534. However, the concession by the Bulzomi interests that the present alleged contravention is a civil contempt may still have some significance if, as has been said, the level of disobedience (i.e. intent or mens rea) required to make out a civil case remains lower. Merkel J summarised the current state of contempt law in Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at [6] as follows: 
 
 
 Deliberate conduct which is in breach of a court order will constitute wilful disobedience of the order, and therefore a civil contempt, unless the conduct be casual, accidental or unintentional: see Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 106-107 (' Mudginberri' ) and 112-113. However, the disobedience will amount to a criminal contempt if it involves "deliberate defiance or, as it is sometimes said, if it is contumacious": see Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525 (' Witham' ) at 530. ... However, as all proceedings for contempt are now regarded as criminal in nature, all of the charges must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt: see Witham at 534.

Secondly , the proper construction of an order is not a matter of fact but a question of law: Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Networks Ltd [2006] FCAFC 41 ; (2006) 150 FCR 110 at [19] . Thirdly , it is not necessary for an applicant to prove that an alleged contemnor intended to disobey the order: ibid, at [17]; nor is it necessary to prove that the alleged contemnor understood the true meaning of the terms of an order or that he or she was aware that his or her conduct constituted a breach of the order: Microsoft Corporation v Marks (No 1) (1996) 65 FCR 117 at 143. Nonetheless it may be highly relevant to the question of penalty that the alleged contemnor disobeyed an order because he or she placed a construction on it that was not it is s true construction: Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd at [38]. Fourthly , deliberate conduct which is in breach of a court order will constitute wilful disobedience of the order, and therefore a civil contempt, unless the conduct be casual, accidental or unintentional: Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at [6] . Fifthly , the facts in issue in a contempt charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] NSWCA 155">16 His Honour relevantly commenced his discussion of the issues by stating (at [5]) that the applicable legal principles had been " usefully and succinctly stated " in the recent judgment of Finn J in Metcash Trading Ltd v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 at [9] in the following terms:
 

 
 
 " First, the order alleged to be breached must be clear and unambiguous: see Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 515-516; and be capable of being complied with: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609 at [40] .

Nonetheless it may be highly relevant to the question of penalty that the alleged contemnor disobeyed an order because he or she placed a construction on it that was not its true construction: Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd at [38]. Fourthly, deliberate conduct which is in breach of a court order will constitute wilful disobedience of the order, and therefore a civil contempt, unless the conduct be casual, accidental or unintentional: Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at [6] . Fifthly, the facts in issue in a contempt charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534. " 
 


 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FCA 650">In my view, the position remains that, where a contemnor has admitted the contempt, genuine contrition and a full and ample apology may reduce the penalty: see, for example, Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at 501; Australian Industry Group v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing &amp; Kindred Industries Union (2000) 97 IR 474 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Info4PC.Com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24. However, where, as here, the charges of contempt are contested, the absence of an apology by the contemnor does not carry any significant weight in the sentencing process.  The considerations relevant to the determination of an appropriate penalty for contempt of Court were discussed by the High Court in Mudginberri Station ; see also Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 ; (2003) 196 ALR 350 (" BHP Steel ") and Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at 501-502. Those considerations include: The contemnor's personal circumstances; The nature and circumstances of the contempt; The effect of the contempt on the administration of justice; The contemnor's culpability; The need to deter the contemnor and others from repeating contempt; The absence or presence of a prior conviction for contempt; The contemnor's financial means; and Whether the contemnor has exhibited general contrition and made a full and ample apology. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCA 266">Turning now to the issue of penalty, the applicable principles are not in dispute and it is convenient to deal with them under the following headings which are drawn from those used by Merkel J in Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 225 ALR 541 ; see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v World Netsafe Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1501 ; (2003) 133 FCR 279 at [16] - [17].

 "Deliberate conduct which is in breach of a court order will constitute wilful disobedience of the order, and therefore a civil contempt, unless the conduct be casual, accidental or unintentional: see Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 106-107 and 112-113. However, the disobedience will amount to a criminal contempt if it involves "deliberate defiance or, as it is sometimes said, if it is contumacious": see Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 530 ... However, as all proceedings for contempt are now regarded as criminal in nature, all of the charges must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: see Witham at 534. "

 Approach to the construction of the orders 
 

6 As Finn J stated in the second of the principles he mentioned, the proper construction of an order said to have been disobeyed is a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FCA 16">9 These are not in issue and can be stated shortly. First, the order alleged to be breached must be clear and unambiguous: see Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 515-516; and be capable of being complied with: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609 at [40] .

His Honour went on to say, however, that other criminal history is irrelevant, citing R v Giscombe (1984) 79 CR APP R 79 at 84.  106 In this particular case, the proposition requires closer consideration. The question falls squarely for consideration in the present case (but does not appear to have been of direct relevance in those other cases which have followed the factors listed by Merkel J in Louis Vuitton [2006] FCA 83 ; 149 FCR 494). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] FamCAFC 154">In Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd and Another [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 225 ALR 541 , Merkel J discussed the appropriateness of "settlement" of contempt proceedings. His Honour recorded that the "civil contempt constituted by the mere failure to comply with an order or a deliberate, but not contumacious, breach of an order was traditionally regarded as a matter for the parties, rather than for the courts. " With that proposition we do not disagree. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FCA 1182">5 Merkel J summarized the current state of contempt law in Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 67 IPR 611 at [6] as follows:
 
 
 Deliberate conduct which is in breach of a court order will constitute wilful disobedience of the order, and therefore a civil contempt, unless the conduct be casual, accidental or unintentional: see Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 106-107 (' Mudginberri' ) and 112-113. However, the disobedience will amount to a criminal contempt if it involves "deliberate defiance or, as it is sometimes said, if it is contumacious": see Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525 (' Witham' ) at 530. ...

 &#8226; The contemnor's personal circumstances;
 &#8226; The nature and circumstances of the contempt;
 &#8226; The effect of the contempt on the administration of justice;
 &#8226; The contemnor's culpability;
 &#8226; The need to deter the contemnor and others from repeating contempt;
 &#8226; The absence or presence of a prior conviction for contempt;
 &#8226; The contemnor's financial means;
 &#8226; Whether the contemnor has exhibited general contrition and made a full and ample apology;
 &#8226; Whether the conduct falls within the most serious category of criminal contempt cases such as to warrant the imposition of a term of imprisonment; and
 &#8226; Whether or not imprisonment is a "last resort" penalty in the circumstances of the case.

<sentence id="cs23" from="[2007] VSC 15">33 In Louis Vuitton Malletier South Australia v Design Elegance Pty Ltd , Merkel J stated: 
 
 
 " Witham did not go so far as to decide that the distinction between civil and criminal contempt no longer existed, although McHugh J observed (at 549) that the case for abolishing the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is a strong one. " [9]  179 In Louis Vuitton Malleterier South Australia v Design Elegance Pty Ltd, [41] Merkel J endorsed the following factors as relevant to penalty: 
 
 
 
 "1.5 In deciding the appropriate penalty, a court should consider the following factors: 
 
 

(1) contemnor's personal circumstances;
 
(2) nature and circumstances of the contempt: R v West Australian Newspapers Ltd; Ex Parte DPP (WA) (1996) 16 WAR 518 ;
 
(3) effect of the contempt on the administration of justice; Durack v Gallagher (1982) 44 ALR 272 at 286-7;
 
(4) contemnor's culpability: Durack v Gallagher (1982) 44 ALR 272 at 286-7;
 
(5) need to deter the contemnor and others from repeating contempt: DPP v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd (1987) 8 NSWLR 732 , Kirby P at 741; and
 
(6) absence or presence of a prior conviction for contempt: Attorney-General (NSW) v Macquarie Publications Pty Ltd (1988) 40 A Crim R 405 at 410. However, other criminal history is irrelevant: R v Giscombe (1984) 79 Cr App R 79 at 84. 
 1.6 In deciding the amount of any fine the Court should take into account the contemnor's financial means: Smith v R (1991) 25 NSWLR 1. The court may also suspend the fine on terms. 

Contrition and apology
 
1.7 Genuine contrition and a full and ample apology may also reduce the penalty: R v Gray (1900) 2 QB 36 at 41-2;
 
Imprisonment
 
1.8 It is widely accepted that the court should only impose a term of imprisonment in the most serious criminal contempt cases: Keeley v Justice Brooking [1979] HCA 28 ; (1979) 143 CLR 162 at 179; Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238. 1.9 In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Hickey [1999] FCA 259 , Carr J held that imprisonment is a 'last resort': see also R v Vasin (1985) 39 SASR 45 ; James (19875) 14 A Crim R 364 ; Skipper (1992) 64 A Crim R 260.

<sentence id="cs24" from="[2006] NSWLEC 738">31 Although the authorities to which I have referred seem to me to indicate that it is unnecessary to prove that a breach of a court order was deliberate in order to establish a " technical " civil contempt, in Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at 497 --- 498 [6] Merkel J expressed a different view:
 Deliberate conduct which is in breach of a court order will constitute wilful disobedience of the order, and therefore a civil contempt, unless the conduct be casual, accidental or unintentional: see Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 106-107 and 112-113. However, the disobedience will amount to a criminal contempt if it involves ' deliberate defiance or, as it is sometimes said, if it is contumacious ': see Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 530. As is apparent from the Statement of Charge, Louis Vuitton is alleging both civil and criminal contempt.
