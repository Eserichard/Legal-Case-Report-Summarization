<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWSC 685">21 It has now been recognised in a number of cases (of which the latest are Parker; Re Strongest Link Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1007 ; (2008) 169 FCR 559 and Re Jick Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 574 (19 June 2009)) that a trust is not created just because a deed of company arrangement identifies particular property and designates it a fund applicable, under the deed terms, by a deed administrator towards the proved claims of certain creditors; and that this is so even if part of the fund comes into the hands of the deed administrator from sources outside the company. Because the deed administrator is an "officer" of the company (as defined by s 9) and particularly where, as here, the deed administrator is stated in the deed to be an agent of the company, receipts of and dealings with property by the deed administrator are receipts and dealings by the company as the administrator's principal. This approach taken by Davies J in Commissioner of Taxation v All Suburbs Car Repairs Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1393 ; (1994) 14 ACSR 753 was approved in Lombe v Wagga Leagues Club Ltd [2006] NSWSC 3 ; (2006) 53 ACSR 387 and has now been adopted in several later cases. The important point is that, unless the deed itself brings about some specific vesting of property and the creation of equitable interests in that property, the deed administrator is simply a company functionary who, like a liquidator, administers company property according to a particular statutory regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 574">32 A number of cases has considered the question whether property contributed by a company or by third parties to be subject to a deed of company arrangement is held on trust for participating deed creditors or remains beneficially owned by the company prior to distribution to participating creditors.
