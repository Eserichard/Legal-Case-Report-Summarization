<citances>
<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 597">I accept all these factors as indicating that leave should be granted in the present circumstances. Section 471B contemplates that the court may impose terms upon the grant of leave under the section. The applicant's notice of motion envisages a condition that the applicant must not take any step to enforce any order for payment of money against the first respondent "whether by way of penalty, costs or otherwise, without the further leave of the Court". There is precedent for such a condition; see Commonwealth v Davis Samuel Pty Ltd (No 5) [2008] ACTSC 124 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Link Solutions Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1790. In my view it is appropriate here. I will therefore grant leave subject to the condition as formulated by the applicant. </sentence>
