 119 In the further alternative, Optus also argues that if there was an error by ACCC, it related only to the decision to backdate and so the Optus ULLS FD, in so far as it relates to the period from 18 November 2005 to 30 June 2006, can be severed from the FD in so far as it relates to the period after the latter date. 120 Telstra, on the other hand, argues that it is not possible to identify parts of the Optus ULLS FD or of the Optus ULLS FD Statement of Reasons that can be excised so as to save the remainder, from invalidity. 121 I considered the issue of severance of a backdating provision of an FD in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) (2008) 251 ALR 372 ; [2008] FCA 1640 at [4] ff, and concluded (at [48]) that the provisions of the FDs relating to the backdated monthly access charges in those proceedings could be severed, with the result that those FDs remained effective in so far as they resolved all other aspects of the access disputes. The issue of the backdated monthly access charges was remitted to ACCC. 122 If I am wrong in concluding that ACCC did not fail to take into account the ULLS Model Terms, I would conclude that the charges in relation to the year represented in the column headed 2005-06 in Schedule 1 to the Optus ULLS FD (see [91] above) are severable, and adopt what I said in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) above, mutatis mutandis , in relation to the severance issue. Arbitration takes place under Div 8 of Pt XIC. 6 In these fourteen proceedings Telstra challenges final determinations (FDs) made by ACCC in its arbitrations under Div 8 of the access disputes between Telstra and the 14 second respondents. 7 I have previously heard and determined three proceedings in which Telstra challenged FDs made by ACCC in relation to access disputes under Div 8: see Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436 ; (2008) 171 FCR 174 (Earlier Reasons) and Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and Others (No 2) (2008) 251 ALR 372 ; [2008] FCA 1640. 8 In those proceedings, Telstra sought review of FDs made by ACCC in respect of LSS access disputes between Telstra of the one part and Request, Chime and Primus respectively of the other part. 9 The grounds on which Telstra relies in these proceedings are set out in the following table (Table), the numerals being the number of the ground in the relevant current form of the application for an order of review:
