<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 85">In the absence of reasons I can draw no inference that matters were overlooked or not taken into account: Vishnumolakala v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 248 at [8] - [13]; Vishnumolakala v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) FMCA 1209 at [44] - [49]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 781">In determining whether it is expedient or in the interests of justice to grant leave to raise a new ground, it is accepted that consideration needs to be given to the merits of the ground proposed to determine whether that ground has a reasonable prospect of success: MZWCL v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 635 at [35] ---[37]; Vishnumolakala v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 248 at [5] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 983">As has been pointed out in other cases, s.66(3) may make it difficult for a Court to draw inferences of inadequate consideration of relevant statutory and factual matters, from the terseness of decision records provided to visa applicants (see Vishnumolakala v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 1209 at [4] , and on appeal: [2007] FCA 248 at [9] - [15] and [2007] FCA 594 at [3] ). For example, in the present case, in the absence of an obligation on Mr Copas to record his findings on material issues of fact, this means that it is difficult to conclude confidently whether he failed to appreciate that the applicants could rely upon only their psychological and physical inter-dependency, without establishing financial reliance, by reason of the more generous definition in reg.1.05A(2), although such a mistake seems quite possible from his brief note. </sentence>
