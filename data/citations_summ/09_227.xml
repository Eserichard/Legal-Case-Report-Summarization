<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 327">The considerations applicable to such an application have recently been summarised by McKerracher J in Mortimer v Opes Prime Stock Broking [2009] FCA 227 at [15] as follows: There must be sound reason to direct that the proceeding be conducted or continued elsewhere. If the party commencing the proceeding chose the place capriciously the Court would be justified in giving no weight to the choice of place. The balance of convenience is important but its weight must vary from case to case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 29">The parties also referred me to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pauls Ltd [2002] FCA 71 (' Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pauls '); Vasta v Tuni Engineering Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1780 and Rafferty v Time 2000 West Pty Limited [2008] FCA 1925 ; Mortimer v Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited (ACN 086 294 028) (Administrators Appointed) (In Liquidation) [2009] FCA 227. I have also had regard to the passages from the reasons for judgment of Gummow J sitting as a member of this Court in Cycles and Wheelman Pty Ltd v Beltech Corporation Ltd (1988) 80 ALR 279 referred to by O'Loughlin J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Pauls . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 933">In Mortimer v Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited (administrators appointed) (in liquidation) [2009] FCA 227 , McKerracher J set out the following non-exhaustive summary of relevant principles: 
 
 
 [15] The appropriate principles arising in this motion are not controversial. The relevant principles presently arising, in my view are these:
 &#8226; There must be sound reason to direct that the proceeding be conducted or continued elsewhere. If the party commencing the proceeding chose the place capriciously the Court would be justified in giving no weight to the choice of place.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1465">These principles have been applied in many cases. Not surprisingly, the applicant places reliance on cases such as Wyllie Group Pty Ltd v ANZ Securities Ltd [2000] FCA 1382 , Mortimer v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd (ACN 086 294 028) (Administrator Appointed)(in liquidation) [2009] FCA 227 and Markethaven Pty Ltd (subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 694 , in which the Court granted applications to transfer proceedings between Registries. These decisions are of limited assistance given the wide range of variables which confronted the judges who decided them. These factors included the residency of the parties and witnesses, the expense and prejudice likely to be experienced by the respective parties were a transfer to be granted, the similarity of causes of action in a proceeding on foot in the other Registry involving the same parties, and the possibility of interference with a fair trial. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1049">In Mortimer v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd (in liq) [2009] FCA 227 , I set out a summary of the principles which I regard as being relevant in an application such as this at [15]-[17]: The appropriate principles arising in this motion are not controversial. The relevant principles presently arising, in my view are these: There must be sound reason to direct that the proceeding be conducted or continued elsewhere. If the party commencing the proceeding chose the place capriciously the Court would be justified in giving no weight to the choice of place.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 467">I recently set out my understanding of the relevant principles in Mortimer v Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited (ACN 086 294 028) (Administrators Appointed) (In Liquidation) [2009] FCA 227 at [15] - [17] in the following terms. The parties have not suggested that the principles are contentious: There must be sound reason to direct that the proceeding be conducted or continued elsewhere. If the party commencing the proceeding chose the place capriciously the Court would be justified in giving no weight to the choice of place.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 257">More recently, in Mortimer v Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited (ACN 086 294 028) (Administrators Appointed) (In Liquidation) [2009] FCA 227 at [15], McKerracher J suggested that the principles applicable to an application to direct that a proceeding be conducted or continued elsewhere were " not controversial ". His Honour stated that there must be sound reason to direct that proceedings be conducted or continued elsewhere, but observed (at [15]) " if the party commencing the proceeding chose the place capriciously the Court would be justified in giving no weight to the choice of place.
