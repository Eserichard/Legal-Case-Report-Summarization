 Australian and Consumer Affairs Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd [2001] FCA 383 at [13] in a discussion in respect to deterrence it was stated:
 
 For a penalty to have the desired effect, it must be imposed at a meaningful level. 
 These principles have been subsequently followed in prosecutions under workplace legislation in Cotis v Pow Juice Pty Ltd (supra) at [68]; Fair Work Ombudsman v Security Protection Services Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2010] FMCA 252 at [74] ; Rajagopalan v BM Sydney Building Materials Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 1412 at [27] --- [29]. There needs to be cogent evidence about the actual financial circumstances of a respondent in order for the Court to consider the factor in mitigation of a penalty: McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No.4) [2006] FCA 1302 at [98] ; Rajagopalan v BM Sydney Building Materials Pty Ltd (supra) at [29] where his Honour Driver FM recognised the need to adduce proper evidence of incapacity to pay for it to be a relevant consideration. The suggestion is advanced that such evidence is not before the Court and the issue of capacity to pay ought to have little, if any, relevance to the issue of mitigation. Mr and Mrs Love acknowledge that the Court may take into account the offenders capacity to pay the monetary penalty. The advice relied upon at Annexure 'A' to the affidavit of Mr Love was advice obtained following notification of the Fairness Test by the Department. The brevity of which the matter is expressed in the affidavit evidence does not place the Court in a position where it could weigh that fact in any meaningful way so the Court has no sense of materiality of the advice, the scope of the advice or the extent to which Mr and Mrs Love relied upon it. In order to be helpful and properly serve the interests of Mr and Mrs Love, it ought to have been disclosed: McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 1302 at [90] and [99] Until the law changed in May 2007, Drymist Holdings had successfully submitted AWAs which were subsequently approved. Once they became aware of the change in the law after the Workplace Authority sent the letter dated 3 September 2007, they sought advice from their lawyer for further assistance. During the period the Employee AWAs were being considered (March 2008) the Workplace Authority sent letters approving other AWAs that were submitted by Drymist Holdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 949">In McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 1302 ; (2006) 158 IR 181 , Greenwood J said at [103]: 
 
 The qualification upon the exercise of the power is that such an order ought not to be made if it will result in a windfall gain. Such a windfall might arise in circumstances where the party receiving the benefit of the order has already received compensation pursuant to s 298U both as to any economic loss in respect of the contravention and any non-economic loss in the nature of general damages.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 333">In a similar vein, in McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 1302 ; (2006) 158 IR 181 , at [87], Greenwood J in this Court considered both s 298U(c) and s 298U(e) of the former WR Act and held that the Court had the power to award compensation for non economic loss. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 853">Penalties may be paid to persons other than the Crown ( Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Austral Bricks (Qld) Pty Ltd [2009] FMCA 143 ; (2009) 178 IR 470). Such a power may be intended to encourage individuals (in that case, a union) to sue for breach. There have been a number of cases in which orders have been made for payments of penalties to a union (cf McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 1302 ; (2006) 158 IR 181 and Schanka and Others v Employment National (Administration) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2001] FCA 1623 ; (2001) 114 FCR 379). In this case the applicant is a person affected by the actions of the second respondent. In Canturi and Another v Sita Coaches Pty Ltd and Another [2002] FCA 349 ; (2002) 116 FCR 276 , a penalty was ordered to be paid to an individual applicant without any consideration of the issue (although, as counsel for the applicant pointed out, there was a suggestion in that case that the proceedings had been maintained by the employment advocate).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 865">Whilst the discretion is at large and informed by the particular circumstances of a contravention, the discretion should be exercised broadly according to settled principle which nevertheless recognises the important flexibility necessary to adapt the exercise of the discretion to particular conduct, the contextual circumstances of that conduct and any other matter relevant to the exercise of the discretion. Judges of this Court have sought to isolate principles or criteria informing the exercise of the discretion to impose a pecuniary penalty and the quantum of the penalty. The observations of Branson J in Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No. 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at [8] are well known and have been applied regularly in this Court (some examples of which are Australian Nursing Federation v Alcheringa Hostel Inc.

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 (As Corrected) 
 This is an application made on 2 June 2006 pursuant to s.663 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 ("the Act") seeking orders pursuant to s.665 of the Act in respect of what is said to be a contravention of s.659 of the Act, constituting the unlawful termination of the employment of Mr Ead Barhoum ("the applicant") by the respondents. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 2033">&#8226; There is a strong need for general deterrence of the type of conduct engaged in by the respondents in the present case. &#8226; The conduct complained of undermines the legislative objective that AWAs should be the product of free bargaining between the parties. &#8226; The totality principle which I explained in greater detail in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 at [30] and the appropriateness of fixing a total penalty for a course of conduct: as to which see McIlwain v Lamsay Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 1302 ; (2006) 158 IR 181 at 216-7. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FMCA 1883">The applicant contends that on the basis of the decision in McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No. 4) (2006) 158 IR 181 ; [2006] FCA 1302 the applicant in these circumstances is entitled to general damages in addition to compensation for economic loss. It is contended that Justice Greenwood there found that the provisions empowered him to order general damages in addition to economic loss, albeit in modest amounts. In that case one applicant was awarded $3,000 and the other applicant $4,000 for general damages. It is noted that the provisions are not identical to the Work Choices provisions, but it is submitted that they are not relevantly different when it comes to compensation. The consideration of the question of compensation begins at p.204 in paragraph 58. At paragraph 60, his Honour concluded that: The consequence in this case of conduct of that character is that 12 individuals suffered a fracturing of the employment relationship, lost the right to derive a gross income from the relevant abattoir entity comprised of the components making up that remuneration and 11 of them were refused re-engagement when the re-engagement process commenced. 
At paragraph 64, his Honour found that:
 
 the economic loss flowing from the contravening conduct to be awarded to each individual is the amount set out at [380]... 

In paragraph 65 his Honour considered the question of general damages, and in paragraph 66, his Honour sets out the section (s.298U(c) of the previous Act) that allowed the Court to award "compensation of such an amount as the Court thinks appropriate".

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FCA 425">17 In McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No. 4) [2006] FCA 1302 Greenwood J made numerous declarations in respect of contraventions of s 298K(1)(a) of the Act, which falls within Part XA; ordered the payment of numerous penalties in respect of conduct in contravention of Part XA of the Act in accordance with s 298U and ordered the payment by certain of the respondents of compensation to certain individuals consequent upon their dismissal in contravention of s 298K(1)(a) of the Act for reasons proscribed by s 298L(1) of the Act, which also fell within Part XA of the Act. In ordering the compensation payments Greenwood J accepted the applicant's contention that s 298U(c), (e) and (f) of the Act, properly construed, were sufficiently broad to provide, in a proper case, a foundation upon which a sum analogous to general damages might be identified as compensation for the disturbance, disruption, loss of opportunity and loss of secure employment occasioned by the termination of employment in breach of Part XA of the Act (see [65]).</sentence>
