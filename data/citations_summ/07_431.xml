<citphrase id="cp7.20" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 96">administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 (cth), s. 44. the applicant appealed to the administrative appeals tribunal against the assessment by the respondent of the customs duty payable in respect of four vehicles it had imported. the tribunal decided that the vehicles were properly classified under par. 84.22.521 of the customs tariff 1966. item 84.22 referred to "lifting, handling, loading or unloading machinery", par. 84.22.52 referred to "other machinery . . ." and par. 84.22.521 referred to machinery within par. 84.22.52 which did not have a working weight of more than fifty tonnes. the tribunal in reaching those decisions applied interpretative r. 2 (1) (a) of the customs tariff to conclude that the vehicles were imported in an incomplete or unfinished state but had the essential character of goods described in par. 84.22.521. the applicant contended that the vehicles came within par. 87.01.31 of the tariff which referred to: "agricultural wheeled tractors and other wheeled tractors that are derivatives of agricultural tractors."  on appeal.  held: per curiam</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp7.21" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 96">(1) the appeal being limited to a question of law pursuant to s. 44 of the administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 , the applicant had to demonstrate that the evidence was such that the vehicles must fall within the words of the paragraph it relied on. currie v. commissioners of inland revenue, (1921) 2 kb 332 ; lombardo v. federal commissioner of taxation [1979] fca 66 ; (1979), 40 flr 208 , referred to.  per fisher j.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 36">An appeal under s 44 of the of the AAT Act is concerned solely with a question of law, which is not merely a qualifying condition to ground the appeal, but also the subject matter of the appeal itself (see eg Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria [2007] FCA 431 ; (2007) 67 ATR 522 ; and TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178 per Gummow J).  As I stated in my earlier judgment of Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria ; [2007] FCA 431 ; (2007) 67 ATR 522 , at [9]: 
 
 ... the Board is required, in essence, to consider and determine whether the applicant is the prescribed fit and proper person. In determining the matter, the Board is directed by the legislature that a disqualifying factor for a person not being the prescribed fit and proper person is, relevantly, if the person is not of 'good fame, integrity and character': s 251BC(1)(d)... The enquiry is whether the applicant is the prescribed fit and proper person, and the disqualifying factors set out in s 251BC(1) do not limit the generality of that enquiry (see s 251JC(1)), although it may well inform that inquiry. The fact that a person is not of good fame, integrity and character means that that person cannot be regarded as the prescribed fit and proper person. However, even if this or other disqualifying factors do not apply, the applicant may still not satisfy the Board that he or she is the prescribed fit and proper person. If not satisfied, the Board 'shall refuse' to re-register the applicant: s 251JC(2). 
 
  In deciding the 'ultimate issue' of whether the applicant is a fit and proper person, the Tribunal must take into account all the material concerning the ultimate issue, and place that material in the context of the matters relied up by the appellant. As I set out in Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria [2007] FCA 431 ; (2007) 67 ATR 522 , at [16]: 
 
 In determining whether a person is a fit and proper person the enquiry is directed not only to whether improper conduct has occurred, but whether it is likely to occur again, and whether the community will have confidence that it will not occur.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 356">The background to the relevant legislation has already been dealt with by me in earlier proceedings: see Toohey [2007] FCA 431 ; [2007] 67 ATR 522.  On 21 March 2007, the Court allowed the appeal and remitted the matter to the Tribunal: see Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria [2007] FCA 431 ; [2007] 67 ATR 522 ('the first appeal'). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 766">The question for the Tribunal is whether it is satisfied that the circumstances in which the misconduct leading to the convictions occurred should be considered 'special circumstances'. The meaning of the expression 'special circumstances' was referred to by Middleton J in Toohey (formerly identified as 'VBY') v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria (2007) 171 FCR 291 ; [2007] FCA 431 , at [27], citing the decision in Re Beadle and Director-General of Social Security (1984) 1 AAR 362 ; (1984) 6 ALD 1 at 3: 
 
 An expression such as "special circumstances" is by its very nature incapable of precise or exhaustive definition. The qualifying adjective looks to circumstances that are unusual, uncommon or exceptional. Whether circumstances answer any of these descriptions must depend upon the context in which they occur. For it is the context which allows one to say that the circumstances in one case are markedly different from the usual run of cases. This is not to say that the circumstances must be unique but they must have a particular quality of unusualness that permits them to be described as special.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 603">A person who is a fit and proper person to prepare income tax returns and transact business on behalf of taxpayers can be registered as a tax agent. Section 251BC(1) of the Act sets out the factors which may lead to person being denied registration, or re-registration, as a tax agent. These include a person not being of good fame and character [36] and having a conviction for a serious tax offence within the previous five year period. [37] The disqualifying circumstances do not limit the matters which can be considered but, as pointed out in the first Federal Court decision in this matter, they may inform the decision maker. [38] The applicable date to be considered is not that date on which the Board made its decision, but the date on which the Tribunal delivers its decision: Shi v Migration Agents' Registration Authority. [39] In this case the time is now five years after the original decision was made. As may be expected the applicant's circumstances have changed over that five year period and the circumstances with which this Tribunal must deal are different, in some respects, from those facing the Board in 2004 and the Tribunal in its two previous decisions. The historically established facts, of course, remain constant, for example, the applicant's conviction for failing to lodge his income tax return for the 1989 tax year and his failure to respond to the respondent's requests that he file outstanding tax returns. What has changed is said to relate to the applicant's physical and mental health, which it is claimed adversely affected the manner in which he conducted his affairs including his professional affairs as a tax agent in the period leading up to 2004 tax year. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] AATA 707">The banning power conferred by Corporations Law s 829, and many similar statutory powers, are frequently described as being wholly protective in their purpose: Statements to this effect commonly appear in decisions involving legal practitioners: Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 176 CLR 256 at 270; Wentworth v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 24 ; (1992) 176 CLR 239 at 250-251; medical practitioners: Health Care Complaints Commission v Lichfield (1997) 41 NSWLR 630 at 637F-638B; tax agents registered under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 : see Dahia v Tax Agents Board of Victoria (1997) 36 ATR 1124 ; Toohey v Tax Agents Board of Victoria [2007] FCA 431 ; company directors and managers: ASIC v Adler [2002] NSWSC 483 ; (2002) 42 ACSR 80 at [56] ; Kamha v APRA [2005] FCAFC 248 ; (2005) 147 FCR 516 at [73] --- [74]; and auditors and liquidators: Albarran v Members of the Companies Auditors &amp; Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2006] FCAFC 69 ; (2006) 151 FCR 466. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] AATA 641">The purpose of the "fit and proper" criterion is frequently described as being entirely protective. Statements to this effect commonly appear in decisions involving the admission or licensing of legal practitioners: see Clyne v New South Wales Bar Association [1960] HCA 40 ; (1960) 104 CLR 186 at 201-202; New South Wales Bar Association v Evatt [1968] HCA 20 ; (1968) 117 CLR 177 at 183-184; Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 176 CLR 256 at 270; Wentworth v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 24 ; (1992) 176 CLR 239 at 250-251. The same protective function is avowed in relation to the licensing of other professionals: Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield (1997) 41 NSWLR 630 at 637F-638B (sexual misconduct by doctor); Health Care Complaints Commission v Abou Hatoum [2004] NSWCA 30 at [6] ; as well as in the case of tax agents registered under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 : see Dahia v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria (1997) 36 ATR 1124 ; Toohey (formerly identified as 'VBY') v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria [2007] FCA 431 ; and the disqualification of persons from acting as company managers: ASIC v Adler [2002] NSWSC 483 ; (2002) 42 ACSR 80 at [56] . In the case of the disqualification power conferred by s 25A of the Insurance Act 1973 , the protective nature of the power is underscored by the provisions of sections 2A and 26 of the Act: Kamha v APRA [2005] FCAFC 248 ; (2005) 147 FCR 516 at [73] --- [74]. Section 2A describes protection of policy holders as the main object of the Act. Section 26 permits APRA to determine that a person, who would otherwise be disqualified, is not a disqualified person, if APRA is satisfied the person is highly unlikely to be a prudential risk. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 703">41 I do not see any error in the AAT's approach, whatever expression of principle was to be applied. The AAT heard all the evidence. Its conclusions were directed fundamentally to the lack of integrity of the applicant. Any textual differences between the reasons of Branson J in Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd v Kenna Investments Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 843 ; (2004) 138 FCR 428 and Middleton J in Toohey [2007] FCA 431 are made irrelevant by the nature of the enquiry and the AAT's conclusions. The Senior Member, in examining past conduct and considering contested evidence, found a lack of truthfulness in the applicant and a proven lack of integrity. Any overlooking by the Senior Member of a late nomination by the applicant at the date of the AAT review was of no operative consequence to the decision.
  40 The applicant fixed upon the content of [6] of the AAT's reasons (see [15] above) in asserting an error based on what Middleton J said in Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria [2007] FCA 431. </sentence>

A question arises however as to the timing of some of the matters relied upon by the Board under this heading. Some of them are matters that arose after the date of the Board's decision but before the hearing. Shi v Migration Agents' Registration Authority [10] is very recent authority for the proposition that in considering a decision to cancel the registration of a migration agent the Tribunal is not entitled to take into account evidence of events occurring after the date of the Authority's decision except to the extent that that evidence might have cast light upon the decision as at that date. In Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria [11] , decided before Shi, Middleton J said this: 
"In view of s 43(1) of the [Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act], where the matter comes before the Tribunal, the Tribunal must be satisfied that the applicant is the prescribed fit and proper person at the time of the Tribunal's determination. In reaching its decision, the Tribunal should consider for itself, as though it was performing the function of the relevant decision-maker, whether the applicant has satisfied the Tribunal he or she was the prescribed fit and proper person.

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] AATA 1383">The purpose of the "fit and proper" criterion in the context of the licensing of legal practitioners has been described as entirely protective: see Clyne v New South Wales Bar Association [1960] HCA 40 ; (1960) 104 CLR 186 at 201-202; New South Wales Bar Association v Evatt (1968) 117 CLR 177 at 183-184; Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 176 CLR 256 at 270; Wentworth v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 24 ; (1992) 176 CLR 239 at 250-251.
