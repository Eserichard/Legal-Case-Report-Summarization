144 That pleading seeks to elevate non-disclosure to misleading or deceptive conduct by constructing a representation to be falsified. In my opinion, that attempt fails. It draws too much from entering into the litigation arrangement. I have expressed the opinion that there was an implied term of that arrangement which obliged Franklins to disclose what it knew about the Coles-Lessor dealings. Contractual arrangements can give rise to misleading or deceptive conduct in particular circumstances (see, for example, the authorities referred to in Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd v McGrath; in the matter of Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited (in liq) [2006] FCA 1403 at [89] ). There is nothing special about the circumstances here which would require that to be done. In any event, the implied contractual term does all the work that is needed. There would be no advantage gained even if a breach of s 52 were established. It is not, for example, a case where a special remedy pursuant to s 87 would be of utility.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 1661">
 The parties have isolated some issues which need to be determined in order that the matter can be brought to a conclusion following the delivery of reasons ( Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd v McGrath; in the matter of Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited (in liq) [2006] FCA 1403). The first thing to note is that there was an error in the reasons in relation to MSD costs etc which should have been deducted from revenue, not gross profit. The parties are agreed about that and the ultimate orders should reflect that correction. </sentence>
