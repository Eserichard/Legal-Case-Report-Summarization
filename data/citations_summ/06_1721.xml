<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 2012">12 In Sood v Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1721 ; (2006) 156 FCR 240 , Gyles J considered the "interplay" between the bankruptcy legislation and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) ('the Commonwealth Act'). The question before his Honour was whether an order pursuant to s 18 of the Commonwealth Act effectively stays execution on an outstanding judgment against the party subject to that order for the purposes of ss 40(1)(g) and 41 (3)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act (at [1]). Justice Gyles recognised at [11] that the concept of a "stay" has been ' stretched beyond recognition ' but proceeded to consider and apply existing authority to the effect that the test as laid down by the Full Court in Wiltshire-Smith was whether in the eyes of ordinary fairness in business it will be said that the order has, in a business sense, prevented the debtor from paying (at [12]). In this regard Mr Ollis says that if he had to make an application for leave to deal with the property the subject of the Supreme Court order, the creditor was not entitled to levy immediate execution.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 1160">10. The situation in relation to the Commonwealth Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) was recently addressed in this Court by Raphael FM in Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd v Sood (No.2) [2006] FMCA 265 , and on appeal by Gyles J in Sood v Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1721 ; (2006) 156 FCR 240 ( "Sood" ). In that case, the restraining order covered "all the property" of Dr Sood "but excluding her interest in any business" , and provided that this "is not to be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person" . Section 24(1) of that Act provided that "the court may allow any one or more of the following to be met out of property, or a specified part of property, covered by a restraining order" , and then referred to reasonable living and business expenses and "(d) a specified debt incurred in good faith" by the person whose property is restrained. Section 24(2) provided that such an exemption could only be made under conditions, including that "(a) the person whose property is restrained has applied for the order" . </sentence>
