<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 783">It is true that the appellant said in an earlier hearing in November 2006 ( SZHEW No 2 ) that he spoke very little Mandarin (at [15]). But he did so in the context of more general complaints about his lack of English, his illiteracy and lack of education. Importantly, he did not say the interpretation provided was inadequate. The appellant did not say so despite having requested a Fuqing interpreter for the hearing in November 2006. By the time of the hearing in SZHEW No 2 the appellant thus must have known that such interpreters were available. Similarly, in 2007 in SZHEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 243 (before Gilmour J) the appellant's grounds of appeal did not suggest that he had received inadequate interpretation services during the hearing before the Tribunal. The fact that the appellant mentioned his poor Mandarin during the November 2006 hearing does not undermine the Federal Magistrate's findings that his claims of lack of involvement with the preparation of his applications for a protection visa and inadequate interpretation before the Tribunal were fabrications.  The appellant sought leave to appeal in the Federal Court against this decision. On 1 March 2007 Gilmour J dismissed this application for leave in SZHEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 243. Again, the appellant was not represented but had received legal advice about his application for leave. The substantive grounds of review foreshadowed were the same as those considered by Scarlett FM. Gilmour J dismissed the application for leave as he was satisfied that there was no error by Scarlett FM (at [28]) and that the substantive grounds of review then relied upon had no reasonable prospects of success (at [29]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 1714">The applicant appealed against the second FMC determination to the Federal Court of Australia. On 1 March 2007, Gilmour J refused leave to appeal against the second FMC determination and dismissed the application with costs: SZHEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 243.
