 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Application 
 The Applicant is the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. He asks the Court to review a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal made on 30 th January 2008 remitting the application for a Child (Migrant) (Class AH) visa for reconsideration, with the direction that the visa Applicant met certain criteria for a Subclass 101 (Child) visa.  As to the claim the Tribunal misconstrued or misapplied regulation 1.04(2)(b) , Mr Dobbie submitted that the Tribunal had stated the correct test and applied it. In circumstances where the Tribunal had twice cited the correct test in the same paragraph, the mere omission of the word "significantly" should not be construed as a failure to apply that test. To do so would be to engage in construing the reasons for decisions minutely and finely, with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error. He referred the Court to the decision of Lander J in SZIUO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [10] at [26] and [27], a decision on appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court. His Honour in that case held that "The Tribunal's reasons must be read fairly and in their context" (at [26] and "I agree with the Federal Magistrate that the Tribunal's reasons, considered as a whole, show that the Tribunal posed for itself the correct test (at [27]).
