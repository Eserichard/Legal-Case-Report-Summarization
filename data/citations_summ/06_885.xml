<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] VSC 523">29 In my opinion, I should follow the decision of Young J in Duncan v Commissioner of Taxation [14] and Barrett J in Noxequin Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. [2] 
9 The plaintiffs rely on the following grounds: 
(a) the Commissioner has not been successful; 
(b) the Commissioner caused the involvement of the directors by issuing a third party notice; 
(c) the directors may be impecunious; and 
(d) it was the plaintiffs who incurred the cost of filing evidence in opposition to the directors' claim that Locktronic was solvent by reason of the financial support it received (or expected to receive) from its parent company, Poltech. In Duncan v Commissioner of Taxation, [6] Young J of the Federal Court of Australia was faced with similar facts as in this case.</sentence>

 "I reject the argument that the Commissioner has not suffered any recoverable loss or damage resulting from the order I propose to make in each proceeding under s 588FF. To the extent that the Commissioner is ordered to pay an amount to the liquidator in each case, representing the amount of payments it received ... , and amounts in respect of interest and costs, those amounts can properly be the subject of an indemnification order.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1468">82 Selected Seeds submitted that it is a generally accepted incident of third party proceedings that a third party is able to defend the plaintiff's claim against the defendant. It referred to Helicopter Sales (Australia) Pty Limited v Rotor-Work Pty Ltd [1974] HCA 32 ; (1974) 132 CLR 1 (" Helicopter Sales "). In that case, a third party's right to appeal against the plaintiff's judgment against the defendant was in issue. The trial judge had given the third party leave to defend the plaintiff's claim, but had not made an order that the third party be bound by the decision on the plaintiff's claim against the defendant. Stephen J said that omission would ordinarily be fatal to the third party's right of appeal, but his Honour said that such an order should be taken to have been made in circumstances where the parties have proceeded in that way (at 14). Barwick CJ and Mason J went further and said that in circumstances where the third party had in fact contested the plaintiff's claim against the defendant the third party has a right of appeal even in circumstances where no leave to defend has been given (Barwick CJ at 4-5; Mason J at 15). It has been said that Helicopter Sales is authority for the proposition that leave to defend is a generally accepted incident of third party proceedings: Hall v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] NSWSC 985 ; (2004) 51 ACSR 173 at 178 [16] per Barrett J. In Duncan v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 885 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 555 , Young J said that Helicopter Sales was authority for the proposition that it was a generally accepted incident of third proceedings that a third party could contest the plaintiff's claim (at 561 [22]). It is not apparent to me that Helicopter Sales is authority for such broad propositions but I do not need to pursue the point because Selected Seeds has satisfied the test in Barton .</sentence>

24 In assessing whether a company is able to pay all its debts as and when they become due and payable, it is necessary to have regard to the debts which the company is obligated to pay at the time in question and those that it will have to pay in the immediate future, and the readily realisable assets which are available to the company to meet those liabilities. The question of what assets are readily available to the company is considered by reference to a commercial realistic view of the position of the company and it is possible to take into account sources of unsecured borrowing which would be available to the company when the circumstances of the case warrant it (see Duncan v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 885 at [39] - [40]).</sentence>
