<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 795">
 
 Austal seeks to administer 459 interrogatories totalling approximately 1,149 separately numbered questions. The respondents complain that many of them are repetitive; comprise more than one question; are in the nature of leading questions; and are in their nature entirely fishing. In Austal Ships Pty Ltd (ACN 079 160 679) v Incat Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 051 556 855) [2009] FCA 368 (Austal No 1), I indicated that I may grant leave for Austal to administer what I described as limited interrogatories because of the unusual circumstances of the case. Over a thousand separate questions was not what I had in mind. As I made clear in Austal No 1, Austal has established one breach which has been admitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 528">Order 15 rule 1 of the Federal Court Rules authorises a party to the proceedings, with leave of the Court, to require another party to give discovery. The use of the procedure has been described as ' an invasive procedure ': see Austal Ships Pty Ltd (ACN 079 160 679) v Incat Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 051 556 855) [2009] FCA 368 at [129] . It has been held that discovery is available to ensure that litigation is decided on the merits and not without ambush or surprise: see Kyocera Mita Australia Pty Ltd v Mitronics Corporation Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 242 at [5] . The procedure of discovery however is not to be used for the purpose of a ' fishing expedition ': see Associated Dominions Assurance Society Pty. Ltd. v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty. Ltd. (1955) 72 WN (NSW) 250 at 254. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] VCAT 2192">In its submissions Glenvill refers to the recommendations in the VLRD Civil Justice Review: Report (2009) at 466 where it proposes that discovery be 'limited to documents which are directly relevant to any issue in dispute' [6] . Being cognisant of those recommendations and the comments of McKerracher J in Austral Ships Pty Ltd v Incat Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 368 at 152 to which Glenvill also referred me, it is difficult to comprehend why it has discovered numerous documents which it now says are irrelevant or not discoverable. The difficulty for Glenvill and its solicitors in obtaining and understanding the electronic archive of the project documents is not a good enough excuse. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 609">On 20 April 2009 I delivered reasons substantially declining the applicant's motions for further particular discovery, refusing an order to direct the respondents to respond to its notice to admit facts and refusing any order for leave to serve notices to produce ( Austal Ships Pty Ltd (ACN 079 160 679) v Incat Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 051 556 855) [2009] FCA 368). I also dismissed the respondents' motion for judgment. </sentence>
