<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 497">The principles which govern the question of whether a court should be satisfied that an application for adjournment is in the interests of the creditors for the administration to continue have been discussed in a number of cases: see for example Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v WPS Motorsport Proprietary Limited [2009] FCA 476 ; [2009] FCA 476 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 640 at [20] --- [23] and Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v KJ Consulting Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2005] FCA 1827. Put simply, it is for the person seeking the adjournment to satisfy the Court that, in the circumstances of the particular case, it is in the interests of the company's creditors for it to continue under administration, rather than be wound up. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 496">In those cases, his Honour observed that the principles which govern the question of whether a Court should be satisfied that an application for adjournment is in the interests of the creditors for the administration to continue have been discussed in a number of cases, and referred to Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v WPS Motorsport Proprietary Limited [2009] FCA 476 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 640 at [20] to [23]. As his Honour observed, the long and short of it is that s 440A(2) of the Corporations Act means what it says --- it is for the person seeking the adjournment to satisfy the court that, in the circumstances of the particular case, it is in the interests of the company's creditors for it to continue under administration, rather than be wound up. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 491">Principles which govern the question of whether a court should be satisfied have been discussed in a number of cases. In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v WPS Motorsport Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 476 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 640 at [20] --- [23], I gathered together what I considered to be the effect of those cases. I there observed at [23] that: 
 
 [T]he long and the short of it was that s 440A(2) means what it says. It's for the person seeking the adjournment to satisfy the court that in the circumstances of the particular case, it is in the interests of the company's creditors for it to continue under administration rather than be wound up. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 502">The main question is whether in terms of s 440A(2) , I am satisfied that it's in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up. As to this, I had occasion in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v WPS Motor Sport Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 476 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 640 (WPS Motorsport) to reflect upon authorities pertinent to the meaning and application of s 440A(2). What I said at [20] --- [23] was as follows: In Creevey and Another v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 19 ACSR 456 at 457 (hereafter " Creevey's case"), McPherson JA, with whom Pincus and Davies JJA agreed, observed of s 440A(2): 
 
 
 
 
 It is evident from the terms of that subsection that before it applies the court must be satisfied not only that there is an administration but also as the subsection says, that it is in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up. The Judge in the present case was not satisfied that it was in the creditor's interests for the administration to continue and it is his decision to that effect that is challenged here.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1399">The position which obtained on 30 October 2009 was that, though the information then to hand concerning the benefits which might flow to creditors under a Deed of Company Arrangement was then general, enough was revealed to admit of satisfaction that it was at least in the interests of creditors for the company to continue under administration for a short time so as to enable the terms of the deed to be precisely formulated, the position in relation to the company's affairs to be investigated at least in a preliminary way by the administrators and for a binding commitment to be made on behalf of a related creditor whom it was said would subordinate his interests to those of other unsecured creditors for the purposes of any distribution under the proposed deed of company arrangement. In effect and as matters then stood, I was persuaded that observations made by Philip McMurdo J in Public Trustee of Queensland v Octaviar Ltd (subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement) (Receivers and Managers) [2009] QSC 37 ; (2009) 69 ACSR 621 told in favour of such satisfaction. It was not at that early stage a patent absence of a basis for satisfaction that it was in the interests of creditors for the company to continue under administration; cf Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v WPS Motorsport Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 476 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 640. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1266">In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v WPS Motorsport Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 476 ; (2009) 71 ACSR 640 (WPS Motorsport), I had occasion to consider a number of authorities bearing upon the question for immediate determination: see paras 20 - 23 of the reasons for judgment in that case, in particular. </sentence>
