<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 908">In turn, by s 24 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (Judiciary Act), the High Court has the same power to deal with contempts as that possessed by the Supreme Court of Judicature in England as at 1903. 1903 was obviously selected as a reference point because it was in that year that the Judiciary Act was enacted, and the High Court of Australia, as envisaged by the Constitution (Cth), established.

 [65] The rationale for the exercise of the contempt power is "to protect the effective administration of justice by demonstrating that the Court's orders will be enforced": Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 107 ; [1986] HCA 46 ; 66 ALR 577 at 584; [1986] HCA 46 ( Mudginberri Station ). [66] In Attorney-General (UK) v Times Newspapers Ltd [1974] AC 273 at 309 ; [1973] 3 All ER 54 at 73, Lord Diplock said:
