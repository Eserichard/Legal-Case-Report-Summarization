<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 95">A special reason has been articulated as a circumstance which 'take[s] the case out of the ordinary': Vu v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 59 ; (2008) 101 ALD 211 at [5] . Furthermore, any claimed explanation for the delay in bringing proceedings must explain the entirety of the period of delay; an explanation for only a part of the delay does not suffice: QAAH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 9 at [7] ; SZLXR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1897 ; SZKTN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 633 at [19] , applied in SZKUO v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 93 at [20] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1570">The six year delay between the Tribunal hearing and the application to the Federal Magistrates Court was not adequately explained. Accordingly, the Federal Magistrate made orders dismissing the application. The applicant attempted to obtain an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal against the Federal Magistrate's decision but this was refused ( SZKUO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 93). Thereafter, the applicant commenced further proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking a declaration that he was not liable to detention or removal from Australia because his visa application had not been "finally determined" within the meaning of s 198(6)(c)(i) of the Migration Act . The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed that proceeding ( SZKUO v Minister for Immigration (No 2) [2009] FMCA 498).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 167">5 On 12 December 2008 the appellant commenced a proceeding in this Court seeking an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal against the Federal Magistrate's decision of 21 December 2007. The Court dismissed this proceeding on 16 February 2009 ( SZKUO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 93) on the following basis (at [36]):
 The Applicant has availed himself of his right to seek review by the Federal Magistrates Court and that Court, in the exercise of an admitted discretion, refused him relief. He has now been given the opportunity to again explain his circumstances and the reasons for his delay in a number of Affidavits filed in this Court and the opportunity to give oral evidence. Notwithstanding the finding as to jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal, it is considered that an extension of time should be refused. Rather than pursuing an application to this Court, he refrained from doing so and sought intervention by the Minister. The delay in bringing the application does not constitute "special reasons" within the meaning of O 52 r 15. </sentence>
