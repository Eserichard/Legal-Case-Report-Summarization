<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 527">Mr Watson then employed solicitors to advise him, and in a letter dated 9 August 2007 his solicitors accepted that authority, thereby anticipating a recent judgment on the point given by Mansfield J in Taylor v Rudaks [2007] FCA 1962. However, the solicitors also said that Mr Watson was not satisfied that a claim for insolvent trading in the amount claimed could be made out, because the time at which the company became insolvent was unknown to him, and the quantum of the debt could not reasonably be determined. In relation to breaches of director's duties, their letter said that Mr Watson did not have "sufficient information to make a decision in this regard. Basically, statements of allegations have been made that breaches occurred but no evidence or details have been provided which would enable the Trustee to properly consider any such claims" . A similar statement was made in relation to a claim for breach of trust. </sentence>
