<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] AATA 176">As a director of Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd at the time, Mr Cosenza was unable to provide Centrelink or the Tribunal with financial statements of the company for the year ended 30 June 2006. Mr McKeown referred to the Federal Court proceedings involving Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd v The Football Federation of Australia Limited , which the Tribunal notes was reported as [2007] FCA 163. In those proceedings, the 2006 balance sheet of Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd showed non-current liabilities of $375,000, which one assumes includes the loan of $182,000 made to ISMA in March 2006, and a trading profit of $38,162. The Tribunal notes the earlier (and related) proceedings in the Federal Court reported as Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd v Football Federation Australia Limited [2006] FCA 1134 .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1792">7 On 14 February 2007, I made orders, inter alia, that the applicant provide to the first respondent security for costs in the further sum of $60,000 and to the second respondent further security for costs in the sum of $40,000 (Orders 3 and 4). I adjourned for further hearing the issue as to how those amounts should be paid. On 19 February 2007, I gave the applicant leave to appeal from those orders. The reasons for the further security for costs orders are contained in Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd v Football Federation Australia Limited (No 2) [2007] FCA 163. I also ordered on 19 February 2007 that the proceeding itself be stayed until 5 April 2007, that being the date by which the further security for costs was to be paid, and that if the amounts ordered to be paid by way of security for costs were not by then paid, that the proceedings be permanently stayed (Order 4 of 19 February 2007). There was no application for leave to appeal from that order. No appeal was brought from the security for costs orders (Orders 3 and 4 made on 14 February 2007) within the time permitted by O 52 r 15 of the Federal Court Rules 1976 (Cth). 29 The second matter argued by the applicant relates to matters taken into account when the further security for costs orders were made. It is not a new argument. It is discussed in Cosdean (No 2) [2007] FCA 163 at [12] --- [14]. 33 In my view, the second and third matters raised by the applicant may be seen as errors asserted by the applicant in the making of the further security for costs orders on 14 February 2007. Otherwise, they are simply an attempt to re-argue matters which have already been argued. I shall also therefore consider whether those matters might demonstrate some arguable prospect of success if an extension of time to appeal from those orders were granted. I do not think these matters demonstrate a relevant mistake of fact in considering the potential award of damages, in considering the capacity of the applicant to fund the second tranche of key rings as discussed in Cosdean (No 2) [2007] FCA 163at [12] --- [14]. Nor do I think that they otherwise provide an arguable basis for error from the discretionary judgment to impose the further security for costs orders upon the applicant: See House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 --- 505.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 766">4 In this matter, the applicant has been served with each of the notices of motion. It has not appeared today. It has not adduced any evidence to indicate that it has any prospect of meeting the order for security for costs, nor to suggest that it is exploring avenues by which it may do so. In particular, it has not indicated that it is taking any steps to negotiate with its principal creditor so that that creditor may provide the funds sufficient to provide the security for costs and to maintain the action. That issue is discussed in my decision in Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd v Football Federation Australia Limited (No 2) [2007] FCA 163. </sentence>
