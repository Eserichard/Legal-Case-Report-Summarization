<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 352">In relation to price, I consider that the explanation of charges in the fine print at the foot of the Yellow Page Facsimile was not sufficiently prominent to prevent it from conveying the Yellow Page Facsimile Representations as to price identified in [38] above: see George Weston Foods Ltd v Goodman Fielder Ltd [2000] FCA 1632 ; (2000) 49 IPR 553 ; Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 223 ; (2002) 193 ALR 629 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Signature Security Group Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 3 ; Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy [2003] FCAFC 289 ; (2003) 135 FCR 1 ; and Energizer Australia Pty Ltd v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 58 ; (2008) 76 IPR 63. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 304">1 This judgment concerns an application, by way of notice of motion filed 1 February 2008, made by Energizer Australia Pty Ltd for what it characterises as a supplemental order following judgment in proceedings it brought against Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd. The proceedings involve a contest between two battery manufacturers or suppliers. Energizer has established that Remington engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct which is proscribed by the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). Final orders were made on 14 December 2007 and reasons for judgment published on 8 February 2008: Energizer Australia Pty Ltd v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 58. The misleading and deceptive conduct concerned statements made on the packaging of batteries sold by Remington (Varta High Energy AA and AAA batteries) and statements in promotional material (billboards and in-store promotional material). At the heart of the unlawful conduct was a claim by Remington that certain of its Varta High Energy batteries lasted as long as Energizer batteries when this was only true of a limited class of batteries manufactured and sold by Energizer.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 171">1 I gave judgment in this matter on 14 December 2007 in the sense that I made final orders. I published reasons on 8 February 2008: Energizer Australia Pty Ltd v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 58. The applicant, by notice of motion (filed 7 February 2008) has commenced contempt proceedings against the respondent. The applicant has also sought, by notice of motion (filed 1 February 2008), what it characterises as a supplemental order in the proceedings in which judgment was given on 14 December 2007. The respondent has raised several threshold issues concerning the notice of motion filed on 1 February 2008. The respondent contended that I do not have jurisdiction to deal with the notice of motion for the supplemental order, and in the event that I do have jurisdiction to deal with this notice of motion, I should not deal with it until the notice of motion for contempt has been determined. </sentence>
