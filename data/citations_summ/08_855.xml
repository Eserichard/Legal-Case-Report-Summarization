<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 132">
 
91 In Kostopoulos v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 855 a judge of this Court declined to follow Moore . He concluded that the power in s 501(2);
 'was plainly intended to authorise the Minister to cancel whatever visa was held by a person who the Minister thought ought no longer be able to remain in Australia having regard to that person's character. ' 
and:
 'I have no doubt that the powers intended to be exercised in relation to any visa and that the words "that has been granted" were not intended to condition or limit the power. '  19 In our opinion, what cannot be done is to construe s 501(2) as if it had been amended in some relevant respect. In our respectful opinion, Moore J fell into that error by excising the words "that has been granted" from the section. Purposive construction does not authorise the Court to constructively amend legislation to give effect to its idea of what Parliament might have had in mind. As was said by Mason CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ in Re Bolton; Ex parte Beane [1987] HCA 12 ; (1987) 162 CLR 514 at 518:
 "It is always possible that through oversight or inadvertence the clear intention of the Parliament fails to be translated into the text of the law. However unfortunate it may be when that happens, the task of the Court remains clear. The function of the Court is to give effect to the will of Parliament as expressed in the law. " 
 Kostopoulos [2008] FCA 855 was wrongly decided. We should add, for the sake of completeness, that the observations of the Court in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 134 ; (2007) 161 FCR 236 at [42] ---[45] are properly to be regarded as obiter dicta.  16 The only decision of this Court which has addressed this argument directly is that of Moore J in Kostopoulos v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 855. The critical reasoning of that decision is as follows (at [35]---[36]):
 "However, I am firmly convinced that the power to cancel conferred by s 501 was intended to be exercisable in relation to a transitional (permanent) visa. In this case, the applicant held such a visa because he had been originally granted an entry permit.</sentence>
