<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 253">The applicant relied on SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 522. The submission was that in that case Madgwick J found error of law where a Tribunal rejected a piece of evidence on the basis that it was hearsay. His Honour found this to be irrational (see at [14] to [19]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] RRTA 299"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 743">It has not been shown that it is possible that a fair-minded, well-informed lay observer might reasonably suspect that the Tribunal rejected or failed to have regard to the applicant's evidence in this respect independent of its intrinsic worth, as it was otherwise dissatisfied with his credit (cf SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 101 ALD 295 ; [2008] FCA 522). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 674">Mr Zipser submitted that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in two ways. First, by failing to be satisfied that the Applicant was ever a Falun Gong practitioner in China, the Tribunal failed to have regard to Ms Lu's evidence (see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte S20/2002 [14] at [13]). The Tribunal had expressly stated that it had made up its mind about the Applicant's evidence before taking the witness's evidence into account. Counsel for the Applicant also referred to WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [15] at [27] and SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [16] at [14]-[21]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 517">The appellant says that SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 522 ; 101 ALD 295 per Madgwick J is authority for the proposition that a failure by the Tribunal to accord separate deliberative reasons for the rejection of the evidence of each witness is a failure to exercise jurisdiction. In that case, Madgwick J concluded that the Tribunal wrongly accorded the evidence of a witness "little weight" for the sole reason that the Tribunal had no opportunity to test the claims made by a witness that her relative had been captured and had heard certain things about the particular applicant's husband. The case also concerned events in Nepal. Having regard to the inquisitorial role of the Tribunal and its statutory function, the rejection of the evidence of a witness as to the statements made to the witness by her relative, on the sole ground identified by the Tribunal, reflected error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 504">I note that in SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 522 ; (2008) 101 ALD 295 the view was expressed that while rejection of a witness's hearsay evidence may be seen as apprehended bias, in this case the manner in which the Tribunal dealt with the evidence of the witness is not such as to establish apprehended bias. Its concern was not whether the assistance was provided (in particular the assistance to leave China) but rather whether such assistance would have been able to be provided successfully had the authorities been interested in the applicant as she had claimed. The applicant's claims in relation to apprehended bias are not made out. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 352">On 16 th April 2007 the application for judicial review was dismissed ( SZIEW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [6] ). An appeal was upheld and the application was again remitted to the Tribunal for reconsideration according to law ( SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [7] ). The Third Tribunal Decision 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 113">The Tribunal was entitled to find that these inconsistencies were of significance and that they were not adequately explained by the adviser's suggestion that parties to a relationship may have different intentions or a different view about the timing of relationship events. Its reasoning in that respect cannot be described as unreasoned or mere assertion lacking rational or reasoned foundation, or otherwise such that the " fair-minded observer might, or indeed would, reasonably apprehend that the conclusions had been reached with a mind not open to persuasion and unable or unwilling to evaluate all the material fairly . " (as Allsop J considered in NADH of 2001 at [115] and cf. SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 522 ; (2008) 101 ALD 295). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 44">The present Ground contends, without particulars, that "the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in dealing with the applicant's corroborative evidence" . In submissions, I was taken to authorities cited in SZIEW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 522 ; (2008) 101 ALD 295 , which identified jurisdictional error when a Tribunal disregarded possibly corroborative evidence 'out of hand', after separately assessing the credibility of an applicant's testimony. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 51"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 1199">When the applicant was invited to make oral submissions he sought to tender a copy of the Federal Court decision in SZIEW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 522. The applicant made no reference to the decision nor did he indicate what he was relying upon in that decision to support his case. However, in submissions in reply the applicant indicated that he believed SZIEW was relevant to his case. His argument appears to be that the Tribunal did not consider a number of documents he and his brother had submitted. He formed the view that because the Tribunal had rejected parts of the evidence, that it was in fact dismissing the documents without considering their content. The applicant believed that the situation was the same as that in SZIEW. The applicant also believed that the Tribunal member did not ask him questions about the independent country information. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FMCA 1202">The judgment in SZIEW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 522 tendered by SZLVW is not relevant to the way in which this Tribunal approached its task. This Tribunal dealt with the various pieces of the factual matrix provided by the applicant and his brother and came to a conclusion. It was not performing the exercise that appears to have been done by the Tribunal in SZIEW. In that case, there was a rejection of certain evidence without a finding as to the credibility of the person giving that evidence, on the basis that it was first-hand hearsay and that the maker of the statement was not available to give direct evidence. That situation does not arise in this matter which is clearly distinguishable from the situation in SZIEW. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 1019">22 On the question of rejecting the evidence of corroborating witnesses, Mr Silva referred to the High Court's decision in Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 (' S20/2002') and Justice Madgwick's decision in SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 522 (' SZIEW') .</sentence>
