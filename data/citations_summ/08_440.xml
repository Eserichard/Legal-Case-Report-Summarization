<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 117">In Keshi Pty Ltd v Firefly Press (Australia) Pty Ltd [47] the Federal Court, citing Burgess Rawson , observed that: ... it is important to maintain a sense of balance in the details of particulars sought or ordered. [48] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] QCA 136">[31] Mr Cooper properly conceded that the plaintiffs should be at liberty to give the best particulars they can and then to supplement them, if possible, after disclosure or interrogatories, [24] but he argued that the defendants had given disclosure, that no complaint about disclosure had found its way into solicitors' correspondence, and that the primary judge's reasons reflected a judgment that the plaintiffs were in a position to give better particulars than they had given.</sentence>

Citing Burgess Rawson McKerracher J observed in Keshi Pty Ltd v Firefly Press (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 440 at para.23 that "it is important to maintain a sense of balance in the details of particulars sought or ordered. " In Chapman v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2008] FCA 86 Lindgren J at para.78 cited Burgess Rawson and said: "It has been suggested that in contemporary commercial litigation, where there will inevitably be a direction for the filing and service of affidavits or witness statements, the necessity for lengthy particulars may be viewed with disfavour". See also Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd v Newcastle Formwork Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 144 at para.29 per Giles JA: "the parties have a duty to assist the court to further the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in proceedings ...</sentence>
