<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 556">In order to secure these objectives it is necessary that contraventions of the BCII Act should be visited with penalties which will serve to deter others from similar misconduct. Penalties must be imposed at a meaningful level if they are to serve as a general deterrent to others who may be disposed to engage in proscribed conduct: see, for example, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 11 at [66] ; Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2005) 147 IR 462 at [41].  In Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 I identified a non-exhaustive range of considerations which are of potential relevance in determining a penalty for contraventions of civil penalty provisions of Chapters 5 and 6 of the BCII Act. These considerations were derived from a number of decisions of the Court under other legislation. They have been found to be relevant to the fixing of penalties under the BCII Act: see Stuart v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2010] FCAFC 65 ; (2010) 185 FCR 308 at 331-2 (per Besanko and Gordon JJ). These considerations are not, of course, to be applied rigidly regardless of the circumstances of a particular case. They may, however, provide helpful guidance. In the end, however, it is the responsibility of the Court "to fix a penalty which pays appropriate regard to the circumstances in which the contraventions have occurred and the need to sustain public confidence in the statutory regime which imposes the obligations": Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Williams [2009] FCAFC 171 ; (2009) 262 ALR 417 at [29] , citing with approval Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 at [91] (per Buchanan J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] AATA 320">In Military Rehabilitation &amp; Compensation Commission v Roberts [43] the Federal Court said in relation to "arising out of" : 
 
 Counsel for the applicant ably made a respectable argument as to the meaning of the phrase 'injury ... arising out of ... the employee's employment'. In the view I take it is neither necessary nor desirable that I resolve that question to finality. I am however inclined, on a tentative basis, to think that the requirement asserted by the applicant that the employee must show some elevation of the risk of the injury sustained, which elevation must result from the employment, is mistaken and that it is enough that there can be shown, as a matter of common sense, some substantial link or connection with the employment which is causal and not merely temporal...

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 584">Each of the three relevant alternative bases on which the injury sustained by the applicant might be determined to be a "service injury" (as defined in s 27 of the MRC Act), set out in paragraph 17 above, involves the requirement of a causal relationship between the defence service rendered by the applicant and his sustaining that injury: see Woodward v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCAFC 160 ; (2003) 131 FCR 473 at 488; Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 222 CLR 115 at 126; Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission v Roberts [2007] FCA 1 ; (2007) 93 ALD 554 at 565. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] AATA 525">The balcony with a large open space above the railing was a common area for use by the occupants of the two units on the third floor. At the time of his injuries Mr Archer was subject to military discipline including garrison standing orders and routine orders. The accident was investigated by the Military Police Special Investigation Branch (this point was considered relevant in Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission v Roberts [2007] FCA 1 ; (2007) 238 ALR 637 at paragraph 58). 
The circumstances before, at the time of, and after the fall were obviously very much army related. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] AATA 730">Counsel referred to other cases where employees were injured while working away from home, namely Kennedy v Telstra Corporation (1995) 61 FCR 160 , Re MacPherson and Department of Defence (AAT 13010, 23 June 1998) at [35], and Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission v Roberts [2007] FCA 1 ; (2007) 93 ALD 554. Further authorities that illustrate an extended interpretation of the concept of course of employment are reviewed in Kennedy (supra) at 61 FCR 160 , pages 166 --- 168. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] AATA 2014">We find support for our conclusion in the dictum of Madgwick J. in Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission v Roberts [2007] FCA 1. Although His Honour did not finally decide the point he expressed the view on a tentative basis that the requirement of "arising out of " employment is met if "there can be shown, as a matter of common sense, some substantial link or connection with the employment which is causal and not merely temporal. " [7] In our view the factors referred to in the preceding paragraph provide such a substantial link which is causal. </sentence>
