<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 3">21 Worimi had also filed two claimant applications in respect of the Land. Both were struck out pursuant to s 84C of the NT Act for failure to comply with s 61: Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 ; Worimi v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 1770. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 206">A native title determination application does not comply with s 61 of the NTA if it is clearly established that it is not made by a native title claim group. A native title claim group is a group consisting of all the persons who, according to their traditional laws and customs, had the common or group rights or interests comprising the particular native title claimed. These propositions follow from the provisions of ss 61(1) and (4), 251B and 253 of the NTA and have been stated in the cases: Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [60] - [61] per O'Loughlin J; Tilmouth v Northern Territory of Australia [2001] FCA 820 ; (2001) 109 FCR 240 (" Tilmouth ") at 241-242 [4] per O'Loughlin J; Landers v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495 (" Landers ") at 504 [33] per Mansfield J; Dieri People v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 187 ; (2003) 127 FCR 364 (" Dieri People ") at 377-378 [55]-[56] per Mansfield J; McKenzie at 223 [41] per Finn J; Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 (" Hillig ") at [60] per Bennett J; Harrington-Smith (on behalf of the Wongatha People) v Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31 ; (2007) 238 ALR 1 at 230-232 [1206] - [1217] per Lindgren J; Reid v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1479 (" Reid ") at [27] per Finn J; Kite v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1662 (" Kite ") at [21]-[22] per Finn J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1929">9 I have recorded the history of this matter in Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2007] FCA 1357 (' Worimi 2007 '). That history includes the striking out of two claimant applications filed by the third respondent, Mr Gary Dates, who prefers to be called Worimi. I will refer to him as Worimi. Each application was struck out pursuant to s 84C of the Act for failure to comply with s 61 ( Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 ; Worimi v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 1770 (' Worimi 2006 ')). Worimi did not give notice within the notification period that he wanted to be a party to the non-claimant application. On 30 March 2007, Worimi filed an amended notice of motion to be joined as a party to the non-claimant application pursuant to s 84(5) of the Act. For the reasons set out in Worimi 2007 , I made an order that he be joined as a respondent to these proceedings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1662">22 The requirements that the group be constituted by all the actual native title holders and that a determination, if successful, is to be made in their favour carry with them two consequences. The first is that a subset or part of what truly constitutes a native title group cannot itself be a claimant group under s 61(1): Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [60] - [61]; although in some, though by no means all, instances, there may be good reason for hesitation in readily concluding that an alleged group is only a sub-group or part of a group for s 84C purposes: see McKenzie v State of South Australia [2005] FCA 22 ; (2005) 214 ALR 214 at [41] . However, where a sub-group of a community sharing traditional laws and customs alone possesses rights and interests in a particular area, that sub-group may itself constitute a native title claim group: see Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 at [60] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1357">1 The Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council ('the Land Council'), previously represented by an administrator, Mr Hillig, seeks a declaration that no native title exists over land at Port Stephens, being Lot 576 in Deposited Plan 48823 ('the Land'). By notice of motion filed on 23 August 2005, Mr Gary Dates, also known as Worimi, sought to become a party to the proceedings. Worimi has previously filed two claimant applications for a determination that native title exists over the Land. I struck out each application pursuant to s 84C of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act') for failure to comply with s 61 of the Act ( Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 ; Worimi v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 1770). Worimi had previously indicated that he intended to file a further claimant application. That has not occurred and there is no present suggestion of any intention on Worimi's part to do so. By an amended notice of motion filed on 30 March 2007, Worimi seeks to be joined as a respondent to this non-claimant application under s 84(5) of the Act. The application for joinder is opposed by the Land Council. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 967">37 Accordingly in my view, and in circumstances where, despite the applicant's non-appearance in Court, the applicant has had an opportunity to put forward evidence in relation to this and other issues, I am satisfied that not only is there a lack of clarity as to the persons who make up the claim group, but that in any event the applicant was not authorised to make the application on behalf of such people of the claim group as have been identified. It therefore appears that the applicant is not authorised to make an application on behalf of all of the claim group. If the applicant represents a family subgroup which claims to hold native title, it is not the group which holds the common or group rights or interests within s 61 of the Act ( Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [60] , Dieri 127 FCR at 377, Hillig [2006] FCA 1115 at [60] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] FCA 1770">1 Mr Hillig is the Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council ('the Land Council'). He seeks a declaration in separate proceedings ('the Hillig proceedings') that no native title exists over land at Port Stephens ('the Land'). The Land Council owns the fee simple in the Land, subject to any native title rights or interests (s 36(9) of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW)) and wishes to sell the Land. On 22 August 2006, I struck out a claimant application by Mr Dates, who prefers to be known as Worimi, for a determination that native title exists over the Land ('the first application'): Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115. Worimi has now filed a further claimant application ('the second application'). These proceedings concern the second application. Mr Hillig moves the Court for orders that the second application be struck out. </sentence>
