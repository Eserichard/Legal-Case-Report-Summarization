<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWCA 413">152 There have been cases consistent with the analysis that I have given that concern the extent to which an entity registered for GST purposes is entitled to recover the GST component of legal costs and disbursements pursuant to an order for costs in its favour. In courts where party-party legal costs are payable in accordance with a court scale, and an order for party-party costs has been made:
 

 
 the total amount of professional costs assessed in accordance with the scale can be recovered: Merringtons Pty Ltd v Luxottica Retail Australia Pty Ltd (VSC, Wood M, 16 June 2006, unreported) at [34]; Keen v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 834 ; (2006) 153 FCR 28 at 36-7 [46] per Rares J; Hennessey Glass and Aluminium Pty Ltd v Watpac Australia Pty Ltd [2007] QDC 57 ; (2007) 69 ATR 374 at [138] - [139]; ChongHerr Investments Ltd v Titan Sandstone Pty Ltd [2007] QCA 278 at [9] per de Jersey CJ, Keane JA and Philippides J. This is subject to a qualification that the costs actually paid by the party entitled to the costs order exceed the scale amount plus what the GST would be on that scale amount. If the costs actually paid do not exceed the scale amount plus what the GST would be on that scale amount, the principle of indemnity requires that the party with the benefit of the costs order should receive no more than the amount it has actually paid: Hennessey at [139]-[140], ChongHerr at [9]. That seems consistent with the position in England and South Africa, as discussed in Merringtons at [22]-[26]. If a disbursement has been paid in an amount inclusive of GST, the amount recoverable is the amount paid minus the GST component, because the entity with the benefit of the costs order has been entitled to the benefit of an input credit for that amount of GST: Merringtons at [35]-[36], [41], Hennessey at [142]-[143], ChongHerr at [9]. It is this situation that is most closely analogous to the present case. If a disbursement has been paid for an item that does not attract GST (such as court filing fees) the whole of that amount of disbursement is recoverable, because no question arises of any input credit having been received concerning that disbursement: Hennessey at [132], [143].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 498">Counsel for the Applicant then took the Court to various authorities that had applied the principles in Bhardwaj ( SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1295 per Rares J at [59]; SZIMG v Minister for immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 368 per Rares J at [24]; Keen v Telstra Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 834 ; (2006) 230 ALR 313 per Rares J at [29]; Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No.2) [2007] FCA 1684 per Rares J at [115]). However, none of these cases raised the issue before this Court of the legal effect of a decision affected by error where, upon judicial review of the decision of the administrative body, Constitutional writ relief was refused. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] WASC 133">I reach that discretion in the next section of these reasons. I consider there the possible relevance of the conduct relied upon by the plaintiff. 132 As to the matter of GST, I note the submissions of counsel for the defendants that, as I understood them, because the plaintiff was a GST registered entity amounts for payments to legal representatives should be reduced to allow for GST recoverable by the plaintiff: in this connection I was referred to Keen v Telstra Corp Ltd [2006] FCA 834 ; GST Ruling GSTR 2001/4; and JH Lever &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Maniotis [2006] FCA 1668 [13]. Those authorities appear to concern what amounts may be recovered from the other side on a party and party taxation, not how I should approach the question of the adequacy of a scale item in a costs determination like the 2006 Determination. However, assuming I must for that purpose reduce each item by 1/11 the effect as I apprehend it is not to reduce the amount concerned in any way material to my deliberations, as will become apparent. 
426 I will hear from the parties as to the orders that should be made to give effect to these reasons, including orders as to costs. JURISDICTION : SUPREME COURT OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA

 SIMMONDS J : 
 Introduction 
1 This is an application by the plaintiff for orders as to costs following judgment in the trial of this action. That judgment was Computer Accounting &amp; Tax Pty Ltd v Professional Services of Australia Ltd [2008] WASC 133. The orders on judgment dated 9 July 2008 provided for this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 413">6 I am of opinion that there is no substance in the contention made by Cordato Partners (Services). The terms of Order 1 were clear. They required payment of a sum certain, once quantified, being 90% of the actual payment by BGR for or in respect of the legal costs and disbursements of any of the defendants in the proceedings. From the point of view of BGR the payment of an amount for or in respect of legal costs and disbursements had to include the amount of goods and services tax because the GST formed part of the price in the tax invoice rendered for those costs or disbursements: Keen v Telstra Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 834 ; (2006) 230 ALR 313 at 321 [43] . Triad and Cordato Partners (Services) had obtained the benefit of payment by BGR of the tax invoices of the respective firms of solicitors. If each of Triad and Cordato Partners (Services) had paid themselves that 90% of the legal fees which they caused BGR to pay for their benefit, they would have had to pay the same amount as BGR had paid, which included GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] QDC 57">Keen v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 834 --- considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] VCAT 2205">26 The first two issues are not in dispute in this case. The third issue is relevant, but can be conveniently considered in the context of the fourth issue as a planning scheme provision ought be interpreted as being within power if at all possible. [10] 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] FCA 930">
 
9 Doing the best I can having regard to the fact that Ms Keen succeeded on one of three grounds, that there was a failed mediation with a registrar of the court and that it was ultimately necessary for Ms Keen to come to the court to have her right to have a review conducted in accordance with law in the tribunal on the taxation of costs, I think that the appropriate figure to fix so as to avoid any further protracted dispute between the parties as to costs is the sum of $13,500 (see Order 4 in Keen v Telstra Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 834). I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares. Associate:

Dated: 20 July 2006
