<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] VSC 154">This is comparable to other recent proposed schemes of arrangement, such as Symbion Health's scheme which had a 6 month lock up period, with Symbion Health having discretion to extend this period up to 9 months;
 
b. there is, as required by Santow J, a carve out in relation to directors' fiduciary duties --- see clause 16.3 of the SIA, which provides for carve outs where either the Dyno Nobel Board or the Incitec Pivot Board has:
 
determined, in good faith and acting reasonably, that failing to respond in any way to that Competing Proposal for Incitec Pivot would be likely to cause the [Dyno Nobel/Incitec Pivot] Directors to breach their fiduciary duties;
 
c. both Dyno Nobel and Incitec Pivot considered that this clause was a prerequisite to entry into the SIA (see clause 16.4 of the SIA); and
 
d. the exclusivity period has been adequately disclosed in the explanatory statement to go to shareholders and optionholders --- see section 1.9 of the draft Scheme Booklet. No encumbrance 
 
(8) Clause 4.4 of the Share Scheme provides that:
 
To the extent permitted by law, all of the Scheme Shares will vest in [Incitec US Holdings] free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise, and restrictions on transfer of any kind. (9) This type of clause has been accepted by the Federal Court in several recent cases, including Re Investa Properties Limited [9] and HPAL Limited [10] . We also understand that, although not referred to in the judgments, there was a similar clause in the Coles scheme of arrangement (clause 4.2(b) of the Coles scheme of arrangement) which was approved by Robson J recently: see Re Coles Group Limited [11] ( Coles Group No 1 ) and Re Coles Group No 2. [12] 
 
 Deemed warranty 
 
(10) Clause 8.6 of the Share Scheme states that:
 
Each Scheme Participant is deemed to have warranted to [Incitec US Holdings] that all of their Scheme Shares (including any rights and entitlements attaching to those shares) will, at the date of the transfer of them to [Incitec US Holdings], be fully paid and free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise, and restrictions on transfer of any kind, and that they have full power and capacity to sell and to transfer their Scheme Shares together with any rights and entitlements attaching to such shares.</sentence>
