<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 456">The material before the Court firstly shows that Mr Reid does not himself claim to be a member of a different claim group than that of the Kokatha People, or of the Kokatha People as part of the KU claim group, so his position is not one where he says that his interests as a member of a different and competing claim group may be affected by a determination of native title: cf Munn v State of Queensland [2002] FCA 486 at [8] per Emmett J; Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for New South Wales [2007] FCA 1357 ; (2007) 164 FCR 181 at [16] - [17] per Bennett J; Kokatha Native Title Claim v South Australia [2005] FCA 836 ; (2005) 143 FCR 544 at [24] per Mansfield J; Davis-Hurst v New South Wales Minister for Land and Water Conservation [2003] FCA 541 ; (2003) 198 ALR 315 per Branson J; Bonner on behalf of the Jagera People #2 v State of Queensland [2011] FCA 321 ( Bonner ) at [18] per Reeves J. Reeves J in that case at [19] pointed out that a person in that position, joined as a respondent party, could not use the status as respondent as an avenue to a determination of native title in that person's favour, as s 61 of the NT Act is the only available avenue for such a determination: see Commonwealth of Australia v Clifton [2007] FCAFC 190 ; (2007) 164 FCR 355 ; Moses v Western Australia [2007] FCAFC 78 ; (2007) 160 FCR 148. Consequently, such a person as a respondent also cannot act in a representative capacity on behalf of others: Bonner at [19] per Reeves J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 321">It has also been held at first instance in this Court that a person claiming to hold native title rights and interests over an area of land or waters affected by a native title determination application will ordinarily have a sufficient interest to be joined to proceedings under s 84(5) of the Act: see Munn v State of Queensland [2002] FCA 486 (" Munn ") at [8] per Emmett J; and Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for New South Wales (2007) 164 FCR 181 ; [2007] FCA 1357 (" Worimi ") at [10] per Bennett J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 3">63 Worimi, by the lateness of his application to be joined as a party to the proceeding, was required to justify the desirability of him being permitted to be joined as a party. He asserted that he had an interest in being joined because he claimed that he, and others, held and enjoyed native title rights and interests in relation to the Land. His earlier claims for a determination to that effect had been struck out. Even if he was unable to get authorisation of the community or group who (he said) strictly speaking enjoyed those rights and interests, he was able to use his asserted rights and interests defensively, to oppose the Land Council's application: Kokatha People v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1057 per Finn J at [48]. See also the primary judge's reasons on the joinder application: Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2007] FCA 1357 ; (2007) 164 FCR 181 at 189, [30] . 20 On 30 March 2007, Worimi filed an amended notice of motion to be joined as a party pursuant to s 84(5) of the NT Act. The primary judge ordered that he be joined as a respondent to the application on 11 September 2007: Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2007] FCA 1357 ; (2007) 164 FCR 181. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1929">9 I have recorded the history of this matter in Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2007] FCA 1357 (' Worimi 2007 '). That history includes the striking out of two claimant applications filed by the third respondent, Mr Gary Dates, who prefers to be called Worimi. I will refer to him as Worimi. Each application was struck out pursuant to s 84C of the Act for failure to comply with s 61 ( Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 ; Worimi v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 1770 (' Worimi 2006 ')). Worimi did not give notice within the notification period that he wanted to be a party to the non-claimant application. On 30 March 2007, Worimi filed an amended notice of motion to be joined as a party to the non-claimant application pursuant to s 84(5) of the Act. For the reasons set out in Worimi 2007 , I made an order that he be joined as a respondent to these proceedings. </sentence>
