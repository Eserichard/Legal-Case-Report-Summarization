I do not propose to rehearse all which I have stated in those earlier reasons for judgment as to principles applicable in relation to the imposition of penalty. Suffice it to say, I have taken into account the principles which I have set out, particularly those in the No 4 judgment. Therefore, these reasons for judgment should also be read in conjunction with the discussion of principle, in the No 4 and No 6 judgments. Those judgments are also pertinent, in terms of penalties which have been imposed on other respondents, in respect of contraventions, either corporate or accessorial, of the Spam Act . </sentence>

These reasons for the judgment should also then, in respect of those two subjects, be read in conjunction with that earlier (ACMA v Mobilegate (No 4)) judgment in this matter. </sentence>
