<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 679">The concept of threat or risk was considered in BRGAA of 2007 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another ; [2007] FCA 1950 ; (2007) 164 FCR 381 in which Collier J at [24]-[26] referred to the requirement that to constitute a well-founded fear of persecution, any threat or relevant risk must be current or prospective rather than merely historical. Further, her Honour held that it was reasonable that a Tribunal have regard to events that had occurred in order to assist its decision as to whether the claimant would be likely, in the future, to suffer persecution. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 470">As to whether the incident was serious harm within s.91R(1) of the Migration Act , this is essentially a factual issue for the Tribunal (see VDAU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 32 at [24] ). As discussed in BRGAA of 2007 v Minister for Immigration and citizenship and Another [2007] FCA 1950 ; (2007) 164 FCR 381 it is clear from the decision of the High Court in VBAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 233 CLR 1 that a threat of harm in s.91R must be a real threat of persecution. Collier J suggested in BRGAA of 2007 at [26] that it was clear from VBAO that " verbal threats without more do not constitute threats amounting to serious harm for the purposes of s.91R ". </sentence>
