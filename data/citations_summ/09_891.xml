<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] ATMO 34">Mr Heerey accepted Mr Ricketson's analysis, which I also agree is the correct approach. Mr Ricketson referred to the recent discussions of the competing lines of authority by Kenny J in Sports Warehouse, Inc v Fry Consulting Pty Ltd (" Sports Warehouse ") [2010] FCA 664 , [26] to [40] and Dodds-Streeton J in Suyen Corporation v American International United Limited [2010] FCA 638 , at [178] to [192]. He submitted: 
In the absence of clear appellate authority on this issue, it is submitted that the ordinary standard (of balance of probabilities) should be applied: see Sports Warehouse , [39], per Kenny J, and see Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 ("Pfizer Products") at 605, [18] (Gyles J) and Chocolaterie Guylian NV v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891 ; (2009) 180 FCR 60 , 70 [26] (Sundberg J). There is an exception to this general proposition about the burden resting on the opponent that arises in relation to subss 41(5) and (6). Thus, while the ordinary civil burden rests on the opponent with respect to the issue of inherent distinctiveness under subs 41(3), it is clear that subss 41(5) and (6) place the onus back on the applicant for registration.</sentence>

The standard of the onus may nevertheless still be considered a live issue although, in my opinion, it has not been changed by the more recent decision of Lander J in Hills Industries Limited v Bitek Pty Ltd [2011] FCA 94 whose words at paragraphs 54-55 were clearly obiter: 
In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; 66 IPR 131 I said that I should follow the decision in Lomas because it was a decision of the Full Court and I should follow Bennett J's decision in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 901 ; 132 FCR 326 as a matter of comity and because other judges of the Court had followed that decision. That is still my opinion. It may be, as Gyles J has pointed out, that the decision in Lomas was obiter and does not strictly need to be followed but it is a decision of the Full Court in circumstances where there are competing lines of authority at first instance which have left judges of this Court divided. The conflict cannot be resolved at first instance and must be resolved in the Full Court. As I indicated in Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; 66 IPR 131 , I favour the reasoning of Gyles J in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skincare Brands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1517 ; 61 IPR 130 but thought because of Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2002] FCAFC 413 ; [2003] AIPC 91-839 and comity I should follow the other line of authority. That is still my view, notwithstanding the criticism of that approach in Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; 237 ALR 787. [Stress added]

 The nature of an "appeal" to the Federal Court under s 35 (and in respect of a decision in an opposition proceeding under s 56) has been discussed at length in several cases: see Blount 83 FCR at 58D-59A (Branson J); Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 at [21] - [22] (French J); Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 at [32] - [34] ( Woolworths ) (French J). In hearing an appeal pursuant to s 35, the Court exercises its original jurisdiction and conducts a hearing de novo. It is to determine on the merits the same question that was before the Registrar --- namely, whether or not the trade mark should be accepted --- and in doing so, it is to apply the same legal criteria that the Registrar is required to adopt under the Act. 
 

  Hills, on the other hand, argued that it had no higher obligation than to establish the grounds of opposition on the conventional ground of the balance of probabilities. It relied on the decision of Sundberg J at 67 in Chocolaterie Guylian NV v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891 ; 180 FCR 60 , which followed a decision of Gyles J in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skincare Brands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1517 ; (2003) 61 IPR 130 and Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 237 ALR 787. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs27" from="[2010] ATMO 116">In its submissions, the Applicant has raised the issue as to how the onus is to be judged. In this regard, the currently-prevailing view (as expressed by Justice Gyles in Pfizer Products Inc. v. Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599) is that the ordinary test of the civil standard of proof (that is, on the balance of probabilities) should be applied. Submissions to that effect were accepted in the decision of Justice Jagot in Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc. v. Goulimis [2008] FCA 1415 ; (2008) AIPC 92-307 (but in the absence of argument to the contrary). More recently, the finding of Justice Gyles has been discussed with approval by Justice Sundberg in Chocolaterie Guylian NV v. Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891. The practice of the Registrar is to follow the current approach which is taken by the Federal Court of Australia, namely that a ground of opposition is required to be established on the balance of probabilities, and I propose to adopt that approach.

<sentence id="cs32" from="[2010] ATMO 106">The onus is on the opponent to establish a ground of opposition in order to succeed. The standard of proof is that of the balance of probabilities. [1] Evidence provided
  Put bluntly, I am not satisfied that any of the evidence the applicant has provided demonstrates trade mark use of the stylized word applied for. In Chocolaterie Guylian [9] Justice Sundberg discussed the problems faced by Guylian in demonstrating trade mark use of the shape of a chocolate in circumstances very similar to those of the present case. He made reference to the decision in Woolworths Ltd v BP Plc (No 2) [2006] FCAFC 132 ; (2006) 154 FCR 97 and made comments which I consider are particularly apt in this case: 
There were particular problems with the survey evidence in BP (No 2) , including the fact that BP's application had been for the use of green as the predominant colour to be applied to signage boards and petrol pumps (thereby leaving within the available scope of the trade mark other unspecified colours), but the survey respondents had been shown a service station with features that were wholly green. However, their Honours' observation that association must be "referable to the use of the mark as a trade mark" is apt to describe the problem confronting Guylian in this case. The survey evidence here plainly shows an association between the seahorse shape and Guylian. This is no doubt due in large part to the substantial sales of Guylian's sea shell chocolates with the seahorse shape over a considerable period of time. However, even assuming that the association in this case is strong enough, the anterior question is whether the association is referable to Guylian having used the shape as a trade mark. In other words, is the fact that a relatively large proportion of consumers may think of Guylian when they see the shape a consequence of Guylian having educated the public to recognise it as a badge of origin. When the evidence of use is considered as a whole, I am not satisfied that Guylian has done so ...
  Whether or not the trade mark is "capable of distinguishing" the designated goods or services from the goods and services of other persons is to be determined by reference to subsections (3) to (6) of s 41. As Branson J said in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks [1998] FCA 440 ; (1998) 83 FCR 50 (' Blount ') at 56, these provisions are "designed to control the process by which the Registrar is to reach a conclusion as to whether the trade mark for which registration is sought is capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods or services". Further, to quote Sundberg J in Chocolaterie Guylian NV v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891 ; (2009) 180 FCR 60 (' Chocolaterie Guylian ') at 65 [9], this process involves the following steps:
 
(a) The Registrar must first "take into account the extent to which the trade mark is inherently adapted to distinguish" the relevant goods [or services] from the goods [or services] of others: s 41(3);
 
(b) If that consideration leads to a conclusion that the trade mark is capable of distinguishing the goods [or services] from those of others, then, so long as the Registrar is not satisfied that any other grounds for rejecting the [application for registration] exist, she must accept the [application for registration] . . .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs33" from="[2010] ATMO 99">In opposition proceedings before the Registrar of Trade Marks, the opponent bears the onus of establishing one of the grounds of opposition stated in the notice of opposition on the balance of probabilities. [2] I will proceed on that basis when determining the grounds of opposition below, and will address the strongest and most relevant grounds as a matter of priority: 
 Section 60: Trade mark similar to trade mark that has acquired a reputation in Australia 
 
The registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services may be opposed on the ground that:
 
 (a) another trade mark had, before the priority date for the registration of the first-mentioned trade mark in respect of those goods or services, acquired a reputation in Australia; and
 (b) because of the reputation of that other trade mark, the use of the first-mentioned trade mark would be likely to deceive or cause confusion.

<sentence id="cs34" from="[2010] ATMO 98">I proceed on the basis that the opponent bears the onus of establishing one of the nominated grounds of opposition namely sections 41 , 43 , 58 or 60 of the Act on the balance of probabilities. [2] The opponent's evidence contains certain unsupported allegations regarding the conduct of the applicant both in the United States and Australia. I attribute little weight to such unsupported statements. As stated above, the opponent must establish the grounds based upon its documented evidence, and thereby satisfy me that they have been made out on the balance of probabilities.

Subsequently, a notice of opposition was filed by Hola S.A. ("the opponent") on 23 October 2008 under Regulation 17A.29 of the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 nominating all possible grounds of opposition. Regulation 17A.31 sets out the grounds for opposing an IRDA. These grounds include sections 39 to 44 inclusive of the Trade Marks Act 1995 ("the Act"), (by virtue of regulations 17A.31 (1) and 17A.28 (1)), and sections 58 to 62A of the Act (by virtue of regulation 17A.31 (2)). Prior to the hearing, the opponent indicated that it would only press sections 44 , 42 (b) and 60 as the relevant grounds of opposition under the Act. The onus of establishing a ground of opposition in these matters is borne by the opponent. In order to successfully oppose the IRDA, the relevant standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.

The trade mark being dealt with in that case was a chocolate seahorse shape and Sundberg J also referred to other authorities which had considered the shape of an ice cream cake [9] and the colour green for petrol stations [10] . However, the principles discussed there also apply to the kind of minimal device Ab Initio is seeking to register here. The courts have not necessarily been persuaded by sheer numbers of generalised declarations from members of the public. They have found survey evidence may not reliably demonstrate any more than that declarants simply recognize a particular sign when they see it. What is not clearly demonstrated is whether they actually recognize the sign as having a distinctive character, as a trade mark . The claim by trade mark owners that the public would in practice rely upon recognition of a shape or colour (or non-distinctive device) alone to identify a trader's goods or services has been viewed with considerable scepticism by the courts. </sentence>

As Branson J said in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks [1998] FCA 440 ; (1998) 83 FCR 50 (' Blount ') at 56, these provisions are "designed to control the process by which the Registrar is to reach a conclusion as to whether the trade mark for which registration is sought is capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods or services". Further, to quote Sundberg J in Chocolaterie Guylian NV v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891 ; [2009] FCA 891 ; (2009) 180 FCR 60 (' Chocolaterie Guylian ') at 65 [9], this process involves the following steps: 
 
 (a) The Registrar must first "take into account the extent to which the trade mark is inherently adapted to distinguish" the relevant goods [or services] from the goods [or services] of others: s 41(3); 
 

 
 
 (b) If that consideration leads to a conclusion that the trade mark is capable of distinguishing the goods [or services] from those of others, then, so long as the Registrar is not satisfied that any other grounds for rejecting the [application for registration] exist, she must accept the [application for registration] . . .</sentence>

The currently-prevailing view (as expressed by Justice Gyles in Pfizer Products Inc. v.

<sentence id="cs72" from="[2010] FCA 198">The question of use as a mark also arises outside the infringement context, namely when deciding whether a mark has been used to establish distinctiveness to justify registration under s 41(5) or (6) of the Act. In Chocolaterie Guylian NV v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891 ; (2009) 258 ALR 545 I held that the shape of a seahorse was not capable of registration partly because the evidence failed to establish that the applicant's seahorse shape was used as a mark. As in the present case, the applicants in Chocolaterie Guylian NV [2009] FCA 891 ; 258 ALR 545 used the seahorse shape on packaging alongside two other marks, one being the prominent GUYLIAN mark. At 575 I said: 
 
 It is by no means the only shape that features on Guylian's packaging. Many of the other sea shell shapes are displayed with equal prominence... On these boxes, the seahorse shape does not in my view function as a trade mark. It is not used in any sense to identify Guylian but to illustrate some examples of the elegance of the chocolates and the contents of the box more generally...it does not seem to me likely that consumers would conceive of the seahorse shape on Guylian's boxes as a trade mark, so much as simply an example of the novelty shapes that Guylian manufactures. 
 

  That is not the case here. In this case, the registered marks 'ALLEN'S', and to a lesser extent 'NESTLE', are prominent especially when contrasted with the positioning and use of the words 'luscious Lips'. See Chocolaterie Guylian NV [2009] FCA 891 ; 258 ALR 545. Did the respondent use 'luscious Lips' descriptively in good faith --- s 122(1)(b)(i)

<sentence id="cs84" from="[2009] ATMO 98">For an opposition to succeed, the opponent bears the onus of establishing at least one of the grounds cited in the notice, on the balance of probabilities ( Pfizer Products Inc v Karam (2006) 70 IPR 599 , per Gyles J at [6] to [26]; Chocolaterie Guylian N.V. v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891 (18 August 2009) per Sundberg J at [26]). The notice cites grounds of opposition under sections 41 , 42 (b), 43 , 44 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 62 (a) and 62 (b) of the Act. At the hearing, the opponent pressed sections 44 , 42 (b) and predominately sections 60 and 62A , and I will address those particular grounds in detail in the following reasons. For the sake of completeness, I note that the remaining opposition grounds nominated in the notice have not been established. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs85" from="[2009] ATMO 97">For an opposition to succeed, the opponent bears the onus of establishing at least one of the grounds cited in the notice on the balance of probabilities ( Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [3] ; Chocolaterie Guylian N.V. v Registrar of Trade Marks .

<sentence id="cs86" from="[2009] ATMO 90">To succeed, the opponent bears the onus of establishing at least one of its grounds of opposition.

See also the recent concurring view of Sundberg J in Chocolaterie Guylian NV v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891 at paragraphs 22-26. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs87" from="[2009] ATMO 88">The onus is upon the opponent to establish one or more of its grounds of opposition.

[5] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs91" from="[2009] ATMO 82">Mr Omond relied on a well established line of authority about the nature and causes of deception or confusion [1] . It is for the opponent to satisfy me that there is a reasonable likelihood of either deception or, at least, confusion. In Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663; (2006) 70 IPR 599 , Gyles J put the relevant standard in terms of the balance of probabilities. See also the recent concurring view of Sundberg J in Chocolaterie Guylian NV v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891 at paragraphs 22-26. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs92" from="[2009] ATMO 80">The notice cites all possible grounds of opposition under the Act. However, via correspondence dated 4 September 2009, the opponent advised that it would only be pressing the grounds of opposition under sections 42(b) , 58 , 59 , and 60 of the Act. I will therefore address these particular grounds in detail, and I find that the opponent has not discharged the onus of establishing the remaining grounds of opposition. For an opposition to succeed, the opponent bears the onus of establishing at least one of the grounds cited in the notice on the balance of probabilities ( Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 , per Gyles J at [6] to [26]; Chocolaterie Guylian N.V. v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891 (18 August 2009) per Sundberg J at [26]). Reasons
 
 Section 58: Applicant not owner of trade mark 
 
 The registration of a trade mark may be opposed on the ground that the applicant is not the owner of the trade mark. Note: For applicant see section 6. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs93" from="[2009] ATMO 77">The opponent relies on a number of grounds but pressed, at the hearing, only the grounds under sections 44, 60 and 42(b). Mr Williams conceded that the opponent bore the onus of establishing at least one ground of opposition but argued, in my view correctly [1] , that this need be done only on the balance of probabilities. For reasons which will become apparent, it will not be necessary to deal with all of the grounds of opposition. Mr Williams's written submissions dealt firstly with s 60, on which the s 42(b) ground is contingent. However, it will assist readers of this decision if I deal first with the ground under s 44. Section 44
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs94" from="[2009] ATMO 74">The onus is upon the opponent to establish one or more of its grounds of opposition. Gyles J has referred to the appropriate standard of proof required in terms of a 'balance of probabilities'. [12] His findings upon that issue, arrived at after an exhaustive consideration of the relevant authorities, have recently been discussed with approval by Sundberg J in Chocolaterie Guylian NV v Registrar of Trade Marks. [13] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs95" from="[2009] ATMO 70">The onus is on the opponent to establish at least one ground of opposition in order to be successful in its opposition. [2] The standard to be applied in deciding the matter is that of "the balance of probabilities". [3] Evidence provided 
 Evidence in support
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs96" from="[2009] ATMO 65">Both advocates made submissions on the extent of the burden of proof that they agreed was on the opponent. Mr Heerey argued that the opponent bears the onus of showing that the application should "clearly not be registered". He respectfully suggested that I should reconsider the practice of the Trade Marks Office, which is that the opponent need only establish one or more of its grounds of opposition on the balance of probabilities. However, since the time of the hearing I have had the advantage of reading the decision of Sundberg J in Chocolaterie Guylian N.V. v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891. </sentence>
