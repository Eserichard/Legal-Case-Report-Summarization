<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] MRTA 416">Based on the academic transcript and letter from the University provided, the Tribunal accepts that the applicant undertook a full time Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree at the University of Baguio from June 2003 until March 2006. The delegate considered that as the visa applicant had failed or discontinued a number of subjects, he was not actually undertaking a full time course of study. However, the Federal Court has observed that the term 'undertaking' may not necessarily be synonymous with the term 'actively participating' ( Sok v MIAC [2007] FCA 413 (Kenny J at [66]). The Court considered that the term could be relevantly defined as 'engaging in' or 'entering upon' Therefore, the relevant question is whether, on the evidence, the visa applicant has been engaging, or participating, or entering upon a full time course of study, not whether he has been undertaking that course successfully. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] MRTA 68">Federal Magistrate Riethmuller's decision was cited with approval by Sullivan FM in Sok &amp; Anor v MIMIA [2006] FMCA 1393 in respect to the approach for determining what is a 'reasonable time'. Federal Magistrate Sullivan also adopted the comments and reasoning of Riethmuller FM on the issue of whether sub paragraph (1)(c) contemplates a single full time course of study at a particular institution. Although Sullivan FM's decision was set aside by Kenny J in Sok v MIC &amp; MRT [2007] FCA 413 the reasoning in relation to this was not overturned. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 272">I agree with Reithmuller FM that the Tribunal must endeavour to arrive at a conclusion on whether the hiatus occupied a time which should be regarded as 'reasonable' in the context of the criterion and the circumstances of the particular visa applicant. As Kenny J observed in Sok v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 413 at [66] : The paragraph does not require there to be justification for the lapse of time; rather, the paragraph requires that an applicant has been undertaking a full-time course "within ... a reasonable time after completing the equivalent of year 12". Of course, the Tribunal's assessment of what is a reasonable time necessarily depends on all the circumstances of the case; and if, in using the word "justify", the Tribunal merely sought to capture this idea, then there was no error. (her Honour's emphasis) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] MRTA 2696">The Departmental policy (set out above) is that enrolment and active participation (including undertaking appropriate assessment) in the course is necessary to satisfy the requirements However, in Sok v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 413 Justice Kenny stated that: 
 
 [I]t may be doubted whether the word "undertaking" is synonymous with actively participating... the word can relevantly be defined as "engaging in" or "entering upon" some enterprise: see The Australia Oxford Dictionary and The Oxford English Dictionary It may therefore have been enough for the Tribunal to have asked itself, whether, on the material before it, the visa applicant had established to its satisfaction that he had been engaging (or participating) in, or entering upon, a full-time course of study. The inclusion of the word "actively" in the expression "actively participated" may have introduced an additional notion, to which the paragraph does not refer. If, however, in using the word "actively", the Tribunal meant to merely indicate that of his applicant must in fact have been undertaking a full-time course as distinct from merely claiming to have done so, when there was no error 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] MRTA 515">In her earlier submissions, the agent contended that failing, dropping or not completing subjects during the course of study does not necessarily mean that an applicant is not "undertaking" a full-time course of study. The Tribunal agrees with and accepts that submission. There is authority for the proposition that the word "undertaking" may not be synonymous with "actively participating". In Sok v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 413 (22 March 2007) Kenny J stated [at 66]: 
 
 There are two other comments I would make, although neither are strictly necessary. ... Secondly, it may be doubted whether the word "undertaking" is synonymous with " actively participating" as the Tribunal apparently thought. As the first respondent noted, the word can relevantly be defined as "engaging in" or "entering upon" some enterprise: see The Australian Oxford Dictionary and The Oxford English Dictionary It may therefore have been enough for the Tribunal to have asked itself whether, on the material before it, the visa applicant had established to its satisfaction that he had been engaging (or participating) in, or entering upon, a full-time course of study. The inclusion of the word "actively" in the expression "actively participated" may have introduced an additional notion, to which the paragraph does not refer. If, however, in using the word "actively", the Tribunal meant merely to indicate that a visa applicant must in fact have been undertaking a full-time course as distinct from merely claiming to have done so, then there was no error. [Emphasis by the Court] 
 
  Applying the obiter comments of the Federal Court in Sok v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 413 (22 March 2007), the Tribunal considers that the relevant question is whether, on the evidence before it, the visa applicant had been engaging, or participating in, or entering upon a full-time course of study during the relevant period.  Taking into account all relevant factors and applying the obiter comments of the Federal Court in Sok v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 413 (22 March 2007) to the evidence before it, the Tribunal finds that during the relevant period, the visa applicant was not engaging, or participating in, or entering upon a full-time course of study. The Tribunal therefore finds that the visa applicant had not been "undertaking" his full-time course of study at the University of Baguio in the seven months (approximately) before he lodged his visa application. Consequently the Tribunal is not satisfied that since turning 18 the visa applicant had, at the time of application, been undertaking a full-time course of study at an educational institution leading to the award of a professional, trade or vocational qualification. The Tribunal therefore finds that the visa applicant does not meet the requirements of cl.101.213. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 1318">46 Did it matter that this exchange took place only between the Tribunal and Mr Oladejo and in the absence of Ms Le and an interpreter? For the following reasons, I do not think so. I accept that, as the Minister submitted, this was not a case in which the Tribunal did not complete the steps in the review process that it considered necessary to afford a real, in the sense of fair, opportunity to present evidence and arguments: compare Sok v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 413 at [52] per Kenny J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FMCA 1237">" (counsel's emphasis retained)
 In those circumstances, the Tribunal failed to comply with s 425(1) and thereby failed to accord procedural fairness to the applicant. A failure to comply with s 425 amounts to jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 128 FCR 553 at [38] . 
 The operation of s 422B of the Act will not preclude such a finding: see WAJR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 106 ; (2004) 204 ALR 624 at [58] - [59] and the comments of Kenny J in Sok v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 413 at [40] </sentence>
