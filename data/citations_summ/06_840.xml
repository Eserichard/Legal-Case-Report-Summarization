<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] AATA 374">In our view, the army was no more in Mr King's case than a surrounding circumstance to his drinking habits. His drinking to excess was in no way attributable to his army service and did not arise out of or in the course of service. We have reached this conclusion even though we acknowledge that the legislative test of connection is an extremely broad one. The SRC Act, which applied to Mr King at the time of his claimed injury, also uses the phrase " arising out of or in the course of, employment ". As the tribunal pointed out in Spriggins , this is a wider formulation than the legislative formula connecting a condition to service in other legislative provisions for compensation. Cases such as Comcare v Mather &amp; Mitchell [1995] FCA 1216 ; (1995) 56 FCR 456 and Kennedy v Telstra Corporation (1995) 61 FCR 160 , which follow on from Hatzimanolis v ANI Corporation Limited [1992] HCA 21 ; (1992) 173 CLR 473 , can be distinguished as depending upon the concept of occurrences within the course of employment. The tribunal observed the distinction was specifically referred to by Cowdroy J in Coward v Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Service [2006] FCA 840 ; (2006) 153 FCR 535 at 540 paragraph 27: 
 Following the above authorities, I consider that the appropriate approach is to consider the nature of the activity being undertaken at the time the injury is received or the disease is contracted, and the circumstances in which that activity is being undertaken. If the activity is the cause of the injury or disease, and that activity is something which is required or expected as part of the person's duties, then clearly the employment contributes to the injury or disease: see Roncevich.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] AATA 1726">I was satisfied on the facts here that Mr Samarasekera's Army service provided only the setting in which he increased his smoking levels. This was a matter of personal choice and there was no characteristic or feature of his employment in the Army or the duties (ancillary or otherwise) required of him, nor anything in the circumstances in which Mr Samarasekera was undertaking those duties [20] that contributed to his smoking.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] AATA 1657">The distinction was specifically referred to by Cowdroy J in Coward v Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Service [2006] FCA 840 ; (2006) 153 FCR 535 at 540 para 27:
