<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 617">Fortunately, that requirement is not found in the later Instrument, perhaps having regard to the criticism of that requirement by a number of Tribunal and Federal Court decisions no less than Repatriation Commission v Cotton [2006] FCA 1523 ; (2006) 93 ALD 118. His Honour, Rares J decided (at [13-28]) that factor 5(b) does not refer to concepts of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependency and the factor should not be interpreted as if it were meaning that the words cannot be decreased import a degree of compulsion or addiction. His Honour also recorded that if the expression was to be given a literal interpretation, absent a veteran being alcohol dependent or abusive of alcohol, no person would ever satisfy the factor. In his view it was sufficient only for a veteran to satisfy the minimum quantity of alcohol consumed in the defined period. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 680">This submission is to be rejected for two reasons. First , this is not how s 43(2B) has been repeatedly held to operate. The High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 331-332 [10] per Gleeson CJ, 349 [77] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ established that provisions like s 43(2B) do not require a decision maker to state findings it should have made but only to state the findings it has made; it is concerned, in other words, with the exposure by decision makers of their subjective reasoning processes. This proposition has been repeatedly applied in this Court: Appellant V324 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 259 at [8] per Hill and Allsop JJ, [54]-[55] per Stone J; Repatriation Commission v Cotton [2006] FCA 1523 ; (2006) 93 ALD 118 at 128 [42] per Rares J; Gilkinson v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1441 ; (2008) 104 ALD 406 at 410 [14] per Rares J; Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 253 ALR 263 at 270 [29] per Perram J; Alexander v Australian Community Pharmacy Authority [2010] FCA 189 ; (2010) 265 ALR 424 at 437 [66] per Bromberg J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 49">The Authority's arguments as to the inadequacy of the Tribunal's reasons were based on these provisions. So far as the argument was based on s 43(2B) it must be rejected. The Full Court of this Court has held that that provision requires the Tribunal to do no more that to state the findings which it has actually made. It does not require the Tribunal to make the findings which it ought to have made: Appellant V324 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 259 at [8] per Hill and Allsop JJ; see also Repatriation Commission v Cotton [2006] FCA 1523 ; (2006) 93 ALD 118 at 128 [42] per Rares J; Gilkinson v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1441 ; (2008) 104 ALD 406 at 410 [14] per Rares J. That conclusion is inevitable in light of the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 331-332 [10] per Gleeson CJ, 349 [77] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ where it was held that s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) --- which is not materially different to s 43(2B) --- operated in that manner. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1538">44 Brennan J said in Repatriation Commission v O'Brien [1985] HCA 10 ; (1985) 155 CLR 422 at 446 that a decision of the Tribunal , if it is made in accordance with the statutory provisions that govern the exercise of its power, is not invalidated by a mere failure to expose fully the reasons for making it. Although that was a dissenting judgment, the principle his Honour stated is of general application (see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 349 [75] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). Of course, much will depend on the extent of the decision-maker's exposure of a reasoning process in determining whether or not the decision can stand. So, in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 224 [39] , Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ referred to the authorities which enabled a court to infer that, where a decision-maker did not give any reason for his or her decision, he or she had no good reason for it. That is not this case. An obligation to give reasons, such as is found in s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act , did not oblige the Tribunal to give a subset of reasons why it accepted or rejected individual pieces of evidence. It is sufficient if the Tribunal, as the decision-maker, sets out its findings 'on those questions of fact which it considered to be material to the decision which it made and to the reasons it had for reaching that decision': Yusuf 206 CLR at 349 [68] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; see too Repatriation Commission v Cotton [2006] FCA 1523 ; (2006) 93 ALD 118 at 128 [42] where I cited the authorities and SZCOQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCAFC 9 at [14] per Moore J, [27]-[28] per Besanko J, and [53]-[61] per Buchanan J (dissenting).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] AATA 993">No less than approximately 10 minutes before the hearing in this application resumed on 16 November 2006, I learnt that Rares J delivered a decision, that morning, in the Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v Cotton [2006] FCA 1523.</sentence>
