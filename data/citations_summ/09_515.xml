<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 85">There are a number of other decisions that have applied that interpretation of s.494C(4): SZBMF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1427 ; [2005] FCA 1427 ; (2005) 147 FCR 485 (S.494C(4) ; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Manaf [2009] FCA 963 ; Swee Yen Tay v Migration Review Tribunal [2009] FCA 515 ; Swee Yen Tay v Migration Review Tribunal (No 2) [2009] FCA 591 ; Cao v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 586.  There is nothing to suggest that I should approach the interpretation of s.494C(5) differently to the settled approach to s.494C(4). Indeed, Besanko J in Swee Yen Tay v Migration Review Tribunal [2009] FCA 515 approached the interpretation of s.494C(5) in the same way as s.494C(4) was interpreted in Xie . That is to say, s.494C(5) does not create a rebuttable presumption about receipt of the relevant document, but rather deems the recipient to have received it by at a particular time. </sentence>
