<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 777">The Tribunal referred to previous litigation conducted by the applicant seeking to obtain judicial review of the Tribunal's 2006 decision. His application had been brought outside the time required under s.477 of the Migration Act , even under the interpretation of that section taken in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZKKC [2007] FCAFC 105 ; (2007) 159 FCR 565. For that reason, Scarlett FM dismissed an application for judicial review (see S1033 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 1921). An application for leave to appeal and for an extension of time was considered by Flick J, and was refused (see Applicant S 1033/2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 216). </sentence>
