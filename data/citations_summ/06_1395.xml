<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 707">Third, the Further and Better Particulars of Contentions of Fact and Law of the Second Respondent filed 4 February 2011 elaborate upon the meaning of "control" within the meaning of paragraph 6 and explain the manner in which Mr Cox allegedly "controlled" Tolfield. While I accept that Tolfield is entitled to be apprised of the case against it, as Isaacs J explained in R v Associated Northern Collieries [1910] HCA 61 ; (1910) 11 CLR 738 at 740-741 the opposite party is not to be told the mode by which the case is to be proved against it. In the Further and Better Particulars Ms Sheahan has given a detailed explanation of her allegations of "control" by Mr Cox. The underlying principle in respect of pleadings is that the case of each of the parties is adequately exposed to the other, and it is important to maintain a sense of balance in the detail of particulars sought and ordered: French J in Police &amp; Nurses Credit Society Ltd v Burgess Rawson (WA) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1395 at [17] . In my view Ms Sheahan's claim in this respect is clear and adequately conveyed to the other parties. It is difficult to see how an order for further particularisation would do other than require Ms Sheahan's contentions to stray into the evidence upon which she bases her claim. Such a step is not warranted: O 11 r 2(a) Federal Court Rules . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 539">The point his Honour made at (7) is of particular relevance here. In Police &amp; Nurses Credit Society Ltd v Burgess Rawson (WA) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1395 at [17] French J (as his Honour then was) went further: 
 
 What are "necessary" particulars of any claim, defence or other matter pleaded is a matter of judgment. The underlying principle is that the case of each of the parties is adequately exposed to the other. It is important to maintain a sense of balance in the detail of particulars sought and ordered. The provision of particulars should not be allowed unduly to increase the cost and delay associated with litigation. In contemporary commercial litigation where, frequently, the court will direct the filing of witness statements or affidavits on either side subject to the right to cross examination, the necessity for elaborate particulars and lengthy debates about them is even more questionable.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 117">In Police &amp; Nurses Credit Society Ltd v Burgess Rawson (WA) Pty Ltd [45] it was said: What are "necessary" particulars of any claim, defence or other matter pleaded is a matter of judgment.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] ACTSC 2">Indeed, as French J observed (at [18]) in Police &amp; Nurses Credit Society Ltd v Burgess Rawson (WA) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1395 (at [18]): 
 
 
 I have no hesitation in rejecting a request for particulars which begins with the words " ... specify every fact, matter, reason, inference and thing relied upon ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1204">Any order in respect to particulars --- such as the orders now sought --- is discretionary and the discretion is to be exercised to ensure that " the case of each of the parties is adequately exposed to the other ": Police &amp; Nurses Credit Society Ltd v Burgess Rawson (WA) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1395. French J (as His Honour then was) there said: 
 
 [16] The function of particulars was described by Gleeson CJ in Goldsmith v Sandilands (2002) 190 ALR 370 at 371, where his Honour said: 
 

 
 
 
 The facts in issue in a civil action case emerge from the pleadings, which, in turn, are framed in the light of the legal principles governing the case. Facts relevant to facts in issue emerge from the particulars and the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 1421">[45] Doukidis at para.34 per Lucev FM. [46] Wellard Feeds at para.17 per Lucev FM. In Police &amp; Nurses Credit Society Ltd v Burgess Rawson (WA) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1395 at para.17 per French J (" Burgess Rawson ") it was said:
 "What are "necessary" particulars of any claim, defence or other matter pleaded is a matter of judgment. The underlying principle is that the case of each of the parties is adequately exposed to the other. It is important to maintain a sense of balance in the detail of particulars sought and ordered.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 440">23 Gleeson CJ in Goldsmith v Sandilands [2002] HCA 31 ; (2002) 190 ALR 370 at 371 adopted the observations of Scott LJ in Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 KB 697 at 712 that particulars fill in the picture of the plaintiff's cause of action with information sufficiently detailed to put the defendant on his guard as to the case he has to meet and to enable him to prepare for trial. However a party is not entitled to be told, by way of particulars, the mode by which the case is to be proved against him: R v Associated Northern Collieries [1910] HCA 61 ; (1910) 11 CLR 738 at 741 per Isaacs J. As much detail should be provided as is necessary having regard to the nature of the allegations and to meet the abovementioned purposes: O 12 r 1(1). However, it is important to maintain a sense of balance in the details of particulars sought or ordered: Police &amp; Nurses Credit Society Ltd v Burgess Rawson (WA) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1395. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 86">78 It has been suggested that in contemporary commercial litigation, where there will inevitably be a direction for the filing and service of affidavits or witness statements, the necessity for lengthy particulars may be viewed with disfavour: Police and Nurses Credit Society Ltd v Burgess Rowson (WA) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1395 at [17] . </sentence>
