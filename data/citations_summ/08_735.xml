<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 202">An application to review that subsequent decision of the Tribunal was then filed with the Federal Magistrates Court on 26 June 2009. That Court dismissed the application in October 2009: SZLPN v Minister for Immigration [2009] FMCA 1011. In dismissing the application, the Federal Magistrate adopted a course of incorporating within his reasons for decision substantial extracts from the written submissions as filed on behalf of the Respondent Minister, and incorporated extracts from an affidavit that had been filed by the now Appellant and treated that extract as a submission. Such a practice is to be discouraged: SZMUV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 205. Although the reality may be quite different, such a practice only fosters a belief --- perhaps otherwise unfounded --- that no real, genuine and independent consideration has been given to the merits of the case and the arguments sought to be advanced: cf. Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430 at 441 to 442 per Meagher JA; SZKLO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 735 at [19] to [20]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 107">In some cases it may be apparent that a Federal Magistrate has carefully considered the application being advanced, notwithstanding a deficiency in the reasons provided: See, eg, SZFPA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1220 at [18] to [19]; SZMUV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 205 at [9] to [25]. In other cases the inadequacy in the reasons provided may lead to an appeal being allowed: See, eg, SZKLO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 735 , 247 ALR 582. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 205">By far the greatest number of civil and criminal cases come before the lower court. One should not draw distinctions between courts but it is of fundamental importance that the lower courts, which deal with so much work and with whom the average citizen has greater contact, should maintain respect for and faith in the judicial system. 

 
Applied: SZKLO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 735 at [20] , [2008] FCA 735 ; 102 ALD 115 at 120. In a subsequent decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Bell-Booth v Bell-Booth [1998] 2 NZLR 2 at 6 the Court observed:
 
 Reasons for judgment are a fundamental attribute of the common law. The affinity of law and reason has been widely affirmed and a Judge's reasoning --- his or her reasons for the decision --- is a demonstration of that close assimilation.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1245">14 The Federal Magistrate clearly outlined her Honour's reasons for rejecting the applicant's allegations of jurisdictional error, want of procedural fairness and failure on the part of the Tribunal to explain its doubts. There was a clear explanation of the factual and legal bases for her Honour's findings in relation to the Tribunal decision. As such, it cannot be said that her Honour failed to " explain to both the litigant and others the basis upon which that Court proceeded and the reasons why the application to review the decision of the Tribunal is either to be dismissed or why the decision is said to be wrong in law ": SZKLO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 735 ; (2008) 102 ALD 115 at [26] .
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1220">18 As the first respondent's written submissions comment, the argument put on behalf of the appellants is not easy to understand. On elucidation at the hearing, it seems to me that the first respondent was correct in understanding the argument to be "that the learned Federal Magistrate made an error in a fundamental respect and this Court ought not 'fill the gap' in view of the comments made by Flick J in SZKLO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 735 [reported at [2008] FCA 735 ; 102 ALD 115]". </sentence>
