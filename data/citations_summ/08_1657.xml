<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 164">I am aware that there is debate and perhaps some uncertainty as to whether in determining an application for recusal, a judge should do so by an order. That matter is discussed in Margarula at [35]-[38] and in Kirby v Centro Properties Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1657 ; (2008) 172 FCR 376 at [18] - [23]. I see no reason why I should not approach the matter in the way suggested by Finkelstein J at [23] of Centro and followed in Margarula . I will frame my refusal to recuse myself in terms of an order dismissing John Holland's notice of motion of 23 February 2011. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 111">12 There was no occasion for the primary judge to make an order refusing to disqualify himself because Cabcharge had not moved the Court for such an order. This failure may be attributable to the line of authority commencing with Barton v Walker (1979) 2 NSWLR 740 at 748 that formal applications for disqualification should not be entertained by a judge. Barton was approved by a Full Court of this Court in Parramatta Design and Developments Pty Ltd v Concrete Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 138 ; (2005) 144 FCR 264 at 275. This view has not commanded universal approval: see, for example, Brooks v Upjohn Company (1998) 85 FCR 469 at 476-7; Kirby v Centro Properties Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 1657 ; (2008) 252 ALR 557 at 563-5; Margarula v Northern Territory [2009] FCA 290 ; (2009) 175 FCR 333 at 340-4. Whatever may be the correct view on the proper procedure to be observed where it is sought to have a judge disqualify him- or herself on the ground of apprehended bias, it is clear that, once the judge has made an order in the proceeding, that order may be impugned on the ground that the judge was disqualified: see Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd [2004] NSWSC 270 at [9] ; Parramatta Design at 275; Brooks at 475-6. This will be so even if the order is made on a mundane interlocutory procedural issue: see, for example, Brooks , where the appeal was brought from an order fixing a trial date.</sentence>
