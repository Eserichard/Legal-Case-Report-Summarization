<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 615">After attempting, once again, unsuccessfully to challenge Bryson AJ's findings by filing further proceedings in the Supreme Court, on 8 December 2008 Mr Tsekouras filed the proceedings that came before Bennett J. Her Honour said in Tsekouras [2009] FCA 429 at [41] - [43] : 
 "At the hearing Mr Tsekouras, who appeared in person, made it quite clear that what he wished to say about these proceedings was that he did not owe any money to Ms Evangelindis or anyone else to whom payments had been made out of his bankrupt estate and that he had paid out amounts of $247,705.24 and $166,469.54. These are the very matters that have been litigated repeatedly. 

 
 I do not doubt that this is a clear case for the application of O 21 r 1 of the Federal Court Rules . I adopt, with respect, what was said by Bryson AJ as to the history of this matter and the balancing of Mr Tsekouras' right to bring proceedings with the effect on Mr Olsen and his right not to be continually harassed by the requirement to defend a never ending series of futile applications. 

 
 Importantly, the subject matter of these proceedings has been heard and determined on more than one occasion and Mr Tsekouras has availed himself of the avenue of appeal in respect of those decisions. As Mr Olsen submits, the Official Ttrustee and the public have been prejudiced by Mr Tsekouras' litigious history. From that history I conclude that it is inevitable that it will continue. " 

  Throughout his litigious history Mr Tsekouras has claimed that he made payments totalling $247,705.24 or sums of that order. Mr Olsen accepted that Mr Tsekouras had made those payments in relation to his personal injuries proceedings. Bennett J accepted Mr Olsen's account: see Tsekouras [2009] FCA 429 at [10] and [41]. Her Honour examined the various claims and assertions about moneys paid by Mr Tsekouras. She found that payments made by the official trustee upon lodgment of proofs of debt totalling $163,521 were owed by the bankrupt's estate as a result of the professional negligence proceedings and were not moneys owed in respect of his personal injuries proceedings. She said that it was clear, beyond doubt, that those matters had been carefully considered by Hely J in making the original sequestration order as explained by his Honour in his reasons: Tsekouras [2009] FCA 429 at [18] .  On 1 May 2009 Bennett J ordered, pursuant to O 21 r 1 of the Federal Court Rules that without the leave of the Court Con Tsekouras both not continue any proceeding and not institute any proceeding. Her Honour found, for the detailed reasons that she gave, that Mr Tsekouras had repeatedly engaged in relitigating claims. Those claims were that first, he did not owe any money to Viveca Evangelindis, the first respondent in the present proceedings, who was his former solicitor, secondly, to anyone else to whom payments (despite his assertions) had been made out of his bankrupt estate and that, thirdly, he had paid out amounts of $247,705.24 and $166,469.54 (or sums of that order) and did not owe the debts in respect of which he was made bankrupt: see Tsekouras v Olsen [2009] FCA 429 at [13] , [14], [41]. Mr Tsekouras had been made bankrupt by an order of this Court made by Hely J on 14 June 2000. The third respondent, Peter Olsen is the assistant official receiver of Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia.  Throughout his litigious history Mr Tsekouras has claimed that he made payments totalling $247,705.24 or sums of that order. Mr Olsen accepted that Mr Tsekouras had made those payments in relation to his personal injuries proceedings. Bennett J accepted Mr Olsen's account: see Tsekouras [2009] FCA 429 at [10] and [41]. Her Honour examined the various claims and assertions about moneys paid by Mr Tsekouras. She found that payments made by the official trustee upon lodgment of proofs of debt totalling $163,521 were owed by the bankrupt's estate as a result of the professional negligence proceedings and were not moneys owed in respect of his personal injuries proceedings. She said that it was clear, beyond doubt, that those matters had been carefully considered by Hely J in making the original sequestration order as explained by his Honour in his reasons: Tsekouras [2009] FCA 429 at [18] . </sentence>
