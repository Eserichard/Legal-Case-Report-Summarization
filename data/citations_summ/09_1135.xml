<citphrase id="cp2.9" type=cited from="[1983] FCA 28">principles to apply in assessing damages. the applicants claimed damages for breach of s. 52 of the trade practices act 1974 (cth). the claim was founded on certain conduct and statements of the respondents (by themselves or their agents), which were said to have been relied upon by the applicants in agreeing to purchase, from the first respondent, a business which it carried on under the name "reliance drilling co.".  the respondents disputed the claim, and the first respondent cross-claimed for the balance of the purchase price. the applicants sought to set off their damages against what was found to be owing to the first respondent. in the course of his judgment his honour dealt with the legal principles applying to the assessment of damages under the act.  held: (1) whilst common law rules as to the measure of damages in tort may, in appropriate circumstances, provide a useful guide, no justification exists for confining the damages which are recoverable under ss. 82 and 87 of the trade practices act 1974 by reference to common law tests. the only limitations which exist in proceedings under the act are those expressed or inherent in the statutory provisions themselves. the statutory right to damages under s. 52 of the act serves a wider purpose and is intended to have a broader ambit than the common law actions of tort or negligent misstatement.  taco company of australia inc. v. taco bell pty. ltd.
