<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FWA 39"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 965">In relation to the suggestion that no estoppel is capable of arising at law or in equity due to the alleged inability of an employer to contract out of an AWA, the respondent says that: neither the 1999 AWA nor the 2003 AWA had in contemplation conversion training to a new aircraft, the B717 aircraft or dealt with that subject matter; [31] neither the 1995 AWA nor the 2003 AWA were expressed to be intended to deal comprehensively with all matters pertaining to the employer --- employee relationship; [32] the AWAs only address some issues relating to upgrading or conversion training and do not evince an intention to address all issues relating to upgrading or conversion training, including for example allowances payable during the course of training, and therefore the estoppel relating to the Training Contribution is outside the scope of the 1999 AWA and the 2003 AWA and is not inconsistent with those AWAs and does not amount to contracting out of those AWAs; [33] any estoppel relating to the salary reduction will not amount to contracting out of the 1999 AWA or the 2003 AWA as the AWAs only address the maintenance of salary during the course of training and the date of payment of the appropriate salary upon successful completion of the training. [34] Therefore, the estoppel relating to salary reduction is outside the scope of the AWAs and is not inconsistent with them because neither the 1999 AWA nor the 2003 AWA dealt with the salary for pilots flying B717 aircraft, and the subject matter, namely, terms and conditions applicable in respect of a different aircraft type was not addressed; the estoppels relating to the Training Contribution and the salary reduction do not seek to vary the terms of the AWAs in a way contrary to the specified means of variation in the WR Act ; [35] even if there is a contracting out of the AWA, there is no barrier to estoppels operating in relation to an AWA. [36] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1156">Further, and in argument, I accept the applicant's submission that pursuant to s 173 of the WR Act a term of any contract that purports to exclude the Standard or any part of it, is of no effect; the NAPSA applies on its terms according to cl 38 of Sch 8 of the WR Act and will continue to bind an employer that is bound by it, regardless of any contract entered into by the employer. Where a statutory instrument confers minimum entitlements on an employee, it is not possible to contract out of those minimum entitlements. An agreement collateral to the instrument may only validly confer additional benefits over and above the minimum entitlements. ( Regional Express Holdings v Clark [2007] FCA 957 ; (2007) 165 IR 251 at [44] (and the cases cited therein), Metropolitan Health Services Board v Australia Nurses Federation [2000] FCA 784 ; (2000) 99 FCR 95 at [20] - [24]), Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union v Givoni (2002) 12 IR 250 at [23]-[33]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 511">Macmahon Mining say that Mr Williams is estopped from denying that he agreed to being employed on the terms set out in the Contract of Employment and that his claim should not be allowed for that reason. Payne v Howison , an unreported decision of the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales in Court Session, is cited in support of that proposition. There are however more recent judgments of the Federal Court in relation to estoppel as it applies to statutory obligations and statutory guarantees of employee entitlements. [47] Those judgments are binding on this Court. [48] Those judgments make it clear that: parties cannot contract out of a statutory obligation or statutory guarantee, other than to confer additional benefits; and an estoppel cannot defeat a statutory obligation or statutory guarantee. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 749">However, having referred to Regional Express Holdings Ltd (ACN 099547270) v Clarke [2007] FCA 957 (which considered what was section 347 (now section 824) of the WR Act) the applicant submitted: "2. The respondent in paragraph 3 misconstrues [Nikolich] . While the Court recognised that claims in the accrued jurisdiction of the Court were likewise subject to the operation of section 666 WR Act, the respondent fails to differentiate between the claims and the proceeding.</sentence>
