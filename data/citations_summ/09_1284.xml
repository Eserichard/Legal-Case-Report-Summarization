<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 178">It is important to note that in Pomare, the applicant was provided with an incorrect postal address. However, in this case the applicant submits that the 'enclosure' was not included with the Tribunal's decision and the address and way to appeal the decision was therefore not provided to the applicant. However, there is no evidence which shows that the 'enclosure' was not included and Mr Markus was not provided with the opportunity to lead evidence on this issue. Furthermore, even if I was to accept the submission that the 'enclosure' was not included, the migration agent acting for the applicant was familiar with the review process and was in the position to proceed but was instructed by the applicant not to because of her financial position: Maroun v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 1284 per Jagot J Reopening
  Evidence reveals that the applicant provided the migration agent with the material from the Tribunal which the migration agent retained. The applicant did not retain a copy of the documents. Therefore there is no evidence that determines whether if the leaflet was enclosed that it provided information, including the street address of the Tribunal and a timetable informing the applicant of his appeal rights. Mr Silva referred to Maroun v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 1284 per Jagot J, which addressed the question of whether a Tribunal leaflet had been included with the notification letter sent to the applicant (as the matter before this Court). A case officer gave evidence about the practise she adopted when issuing notification letters and maintaining correspondence filing. Based on that information, Her Honour held that the pamphlet or leaflet was enclosed in the notification letter. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 63">In considering whether the provisions of these sub-sections are answered by the form it is accepted by both parties that the form must be looked at as a whole [3] and this is what I shall attempt to do. The first point I would make is that I cannot see that there is anything in the form that could be described as "a last address for service". This phrase is descriptive of an event which has particular legal connotations. It can be seen that the manner in which the form is set out (first the postal address, then the email address) mirrors the manner in which the sub-sections of the Act extracted are set out. I am of the view that the use of the words in the Act "another method" indicates alternatives which are not exclusive. [4] "as the Minister submitted, choice of method was for the Minister to decide. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FMCA 19">He relied on: R v Foster; Ex parte The Commonwealth Life (Amalgamated) Assurances Ltd [1952] HCA 10 ; (1952) 85 CLR 138 at 155 per Dixon, Fullagar and Kitto JJ, Ex parte IBM Global Services Australia Ltd [2005] FCAFC 66 at [27] per Gray, Whitlam and Moore JJ, Maroun v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1284 (" Maroun ") per Jagot J at [15], Haque v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship (No 3) [2010] FCA 772 per Gilmour J at [26]-[29], Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLSP [2010] FCAFC 108 (" SLZSP ") at [71] per Kenny J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 825">I was referred in this respect to the judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZLSP [2010] FCAFC 108. In that case, Kenny J explained her reasons for dismissing the Minister's appeal: 71. It is well-established that the onus lies with the party seeking to establish jurisdictional error: see, for example, R v Foster; Ex parte The Commonwealth Life (Amalgamated) Assurances Ltd [1952] HCA 10 ; (1952) 85 CLR 138 at 155 per Dixon, Fullagar and Kitto JJ; Ex parte IBM Global Services Australia Ltd [2005] FCAFC 66 at [27] per Gray, Whitlam and Moore JJ; and Maroun v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1284 at [15] per Jagot J. However, as this Court has observed, "[i]ssues regarding the burden of proof are not always straightforward in judicial review proceedings": see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 242 ALR 455 at 472 [55] per Kenny J. If the respondents' onus entails negating the possibility that an unidentified and apparently unidentifiable text, which was not referred to in the Tribunal's s 430 statement, provided the otherwise absent rational basis for the Tribunal's finding, then their appeal must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCAFC 108">71 It is well-established that the onus lies with the party seeking to establish jurisdictional error: see, for example, R v Foster; Ex parte The Commonwealth Life (Amalgamated) Assurances Ltd [1952] HCA 10 ; (1952) 85 CLR 138 at 155 per Dixon, Fullagar and Kitto JJ; Ex parte IBM Global Services Australia Ltd [2005] FCAFC 66 at [27] per Gray, Whitlam and Moore JJ; and Maroun v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1284 at [15] per Jagot J.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] MRTA 1779">This is what occurred. The Tribunal did not come to a mistaken view of the law and correctly declined to exercise jurisdiction in this case as the time limit for lodging applications was not at large. 
 Maroun v MIAC [2009] FCA 1284 was a case in which the Court found on the evidence that the MRT review leaflet had been included with the notification letter, contrary to the applicant's allegation that it had not been included. Jagot J preferred the evidence adduced by the respondent on this point, which included the oral evidence of a departmental officer, and rejected the applicant's argument that he ought to have been informed of all relevant review registries where an application for review could be made. Jagot J found no such obligation in the section and stated:
 " Section 66(2) (d)(iv) does not say that the notice must identify all places where an application for review can be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 555">The applicant's amended application does not appear to contend that the communication of information in a brochure, rather than in the body of the notification letter, provides a point of distinction. In my opinion, the brochure amounted to sufficient communication of the information required by s.66. I note that a similar brochure was regarded as being a sufficient medium for communication of the matters under s.66(2) in Maroun v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 1284 , (2009) 112 ALD 424 at [18] to [22], and in the Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZMTR [2009] FCAFC 186 ; (2009) 180 FCR 586 at [45] to [49]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCAFC 79">58 The applicant has always given, as her residential address in Australia, an address at Harris Park in New South Wales. When she lodged her application for review in the RRT she did so at the Sydney registry of the RRT. It is clear, as a matter of fact, that no prejudice was suffered by her from the failure to draw to her attention the possibility that an application for review might be lodged at a registry of the AAT in Brisbane, Adelaide or Perth. However she now relies upon a decision of a judge of this Court given on 22 April 2010 ( Hasan v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2010] FCA 375 ( "Hasan" )), after the hearing and decision of the RRT, to the effect that a failure to advise a potential applicant for review of the facility of lodging an application for review at registries of the AAT in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth constitutes a failure to comply with the provisions of the Act which is fatal to the jurisdiction of the RRT. In Hasan , North J concluded that it was necessary to advise a potential applicant for review of all places where such an application might be made. His Honour considered that a failure to comply with this requirement had the consequence that no notification was given as required by the Act. He expressly disagreed with a conclusion expressed by Jagot J in Maroun v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1284 ( "Maroun" ) that s 66(2)(d)(iv) of the Act does not require the identification of all places where an application for review can be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FCA 529">The first respondent submits that he would, amongst other things, have put detailed argument on authorities such as Maroun v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1284 ; (2009) 112 ALD 424 , a recent judgment of Jagot J in this court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] FCA 375">In Maroun v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1284 ; (2009) 112 ALD 424 , Jagot J upheld the finding of the federal magistrate that the brochure annexed to the letter from the delegate included the addresses of all the places where an application could be lodged. Consequently, the notice was held to comply with s 66(2)(d)(iv). However, her Honour went on to say in obiter (at [21]): 
 
 Section 66(2)(d)(iv) does not say that the notice must identify all places where an application for review can be made. It states only that the notice must state "where the application for review can be made". I do not accept the appellant's submissions to the contrary. Even if the section were construed as requiring all locations where an application can be made, having regard to the principles in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [91]- [93], I am not satisfied that any breach of s 66(2)(d)(iv), no matter how trivial, would operate to invalidate a notice. However, as I did not receive detailed submissions on that question I say no more about it. "

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 1206">After considering all the evidence, I was not able to arrive at a conclusion on the balance of probabilities that Ms Clifford's email in fact never reached Ms Sainju's Hotmail mailbox. If such a finding were necessary before deciding that the Tribunal had jurisdiction, then Ms Sainju's present application would therefore fail. This accepts the Minister's contention that the evidentiary onus of proof of non-receipt fell on Ms Sainju, since I am bound by this opinion of Jagot J in Maroun v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 1284 at [15] : 15 As a general proposition, the characterisation of a matter as a jurisdictional fact does not alter the appellant's onus of proof. The legal onus to prove jurisdictional error by the Tribunal lies with the appellant. The legal onus may be discharged by reference to any and all parts of the evidence, but it does not shift from the appellant merely because the fact in issue may be described as a jurisdictional fact (and thus is a matter a court must decide for itself). 
I note that a converse onus of proof applies in relation to a controversy about satisfaction of a time limit on judicial review applications (see WACB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 50 , (2004) 79 ALJR 94 at [9] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FMCA 1124">Since dictating this decision, indeed, on the very day it was to be handed down, my attention was drawn to a decision of Jagot J Maroun v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 1284 published on 12 November 2009. That case also involved, tangentially in my view, a consideration of whether the notice from the Department was required to provide details of every office at which an application for review could be made but was primarily concerned with a factual question as to whether or not the delegate's decision was accompanied in the envelope in which it was sent by a brochure which set out those details. Jagot J found that the Federal Magistrate was able to draw an inference that it was and she went further to find that as a matter of fact that the leaflet did identify all places where an application for review could be made [19].</sentence>
