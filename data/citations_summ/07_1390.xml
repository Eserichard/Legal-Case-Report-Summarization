<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 310">In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 1390 , Finn J at [4] adopted the following observations of Debelle J in Centrestate Exports Pty Ltd v Amarantos Shipping Co Ltd [2005] SASC 158 at [32] , which are consistent with the acceptance by the Full Court in Jeans of the existence of a broad discretion that is to be exercised having regard to all the circumstances of the case: 
 
 The overriding consideration is the interests of justice. The Court will not lightly permit a party to withdraw an admission where the other party has acted to its detriment on the admission or is otherwise prejudiced by the withdrawal. It is plainly necessary to have regard to all relevant factors including the nature and importance of the admission, the circumstances in which the admission was made, whether the admission was made deliberately or inadvertently, the reason given for the application to withdraw, the detriment or prejudice which might be caused to the other party and the stage which the proceedings have reached, and whether the admission is contrary to the facts. The list of relevant factors affecting the Court's decision will plainly vary from case to case.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 773">The relevant principles governing the grant of leave to withdraw an admission are well established: e.g. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 1390 at [4] and the authorities cited; G and M v Armellin (2008) 219 FCR 359 at [116]. </sentence>
