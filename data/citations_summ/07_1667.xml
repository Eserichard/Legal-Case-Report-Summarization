<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 301">On the basis that the Tribunal accepted that a remote rural village might not be a suitable environment for a gay man to live, the Tribunal also found that the Applicant could move to an urban environment and avoid the conservative attitudes of his remote village (CB 98 at [63]). The Tribunal found that the Applicant had the resources, ability and opportunity to move in Nepal as he had in the past. In making this finding, the Tribunal approach is consistent with the principles outlined by the High Court in SZATV v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] HCA 40 ; (2007) 237 ALR 634 ; SZKDY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1667. In so finding, the Tribunal noted that he had considered and relied upon recent independent country information which pointed to the conclusion that gay men in Nepal are no longer discriminated against and are not subjected to the forms of harm that amounted to persecution (CB 98 at [63] --- [64]). The Tribunal concluded that the Applicant did not face a real chance of persecution in Nepal for the reasons claimed. Grounds of review
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 707">11 It is considered that there is no basis in the present proceedings to reach any conclusion other than that the evaluation of the now Appellant's claim by the Tribunal was " proper, realistic and fair ". The alleged error on the part of the Tribunal in making the findings it made was not further identified other than a submission made orally by the Appellant yesterday that he could not relocate within India because of language limitations. But that was a matter addressed by the Tribunal and resolved against the Appellant. Any further complaint as to the decision in fact reached by the Tribunal, it is considered, is a complaint as to the merits of the decision reached.
