<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 46">On 23 October 2009, a judge of the Court dismissed the claim of the appellants as applicants for the Wong-goo-tt-oo (WGTO) people for a determination of native title of rights and interests: Dale v State of Western Australia [2009] FCA 1201 ; (2009) 261 ALR 21 ( Dale ). The Court did so on the motion of the State of Western Australia (the State) that the claim should be summarily dismissed because it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. This is an appeal from that decision. The claim itself has a long and somewhat complex history. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 157">36 In this case the Quall applicants and the Northern Territory were both parties in the proceeding in Risk. It is therefore distinguishable from Ramsay. As the primary judge correctly found, it is not necessary that the parties in both proceedings be identical; all that is necessary is that the parties are common to both sets of proceedings. The requirement was recently considered by McKerracher J in Dale v State of Western Australia [2009] FCA 1201. As his Honour observed at [33], issue estoppel may only be raised against a party who is a party to both the relevant proceedings. McKerracher J added:
 
 
 However, it does not follow from this that a plea of issue estoppel will be defeated merely by the addition of a new party or the removal of a previous party in the second proceeding. </sentence>
