<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 777">It is a jurisdiction that "is to be regarded as exceptional and is to be exercised with caution"; Kallinicos v Hunt [2005] NSWSC 1181 ; (2005) 64 NSWLR 561 at 582. In this case the emphasis must be on "reasonably informed". [4] Accepting that this Court has no inherent jurisdiction, but rather an implied incidental power to make orders necessarily incidental to express powers, [5] and substituting the concept of implied incidental power for inherent jurisdiction in the above summary and quotation, the grounds set out in Bahonko , Geelong School Supplies and Canberra Residential Developments are the grounds on which the Court might restrain a lawyer from acting for a party. In this case the Court deals with the matter on the basis of its power to control the conduct of legal practitioners as officers of the Court. In relation to lawyers acting for relatives there is a comparative dearth of authority.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] NSWSC 934">In Empire (Aust) Nominees Pty Ltd v Vince [2000] VSC 324 ; (2000) 18 ACLC 738 Warren J (as her Honour then was) considered that the court was empowered to make an order under s 477(2B) retrospectively either in its inherent jurisdiction, or pursuant to s 479(3) of the Corporations Law. Her Honour also made orders pursuant to s 1322(4)(a) and (d) of the Corporations Law declaring that the agreement entered into without approval was not thereby invalid and extending the time for making application under s 477(2B) for the application for approval under that provision. In Re Read [2007] FCA 1985 ; (2007) 164 FCR 237 French J (as his Honour then was) held that s 1322(4)(d) of the Corporations Act could not be relied upon to extend time under s 477(2B) because the latter provision did not fix a period for making application which could be extended under s 1322(4)(d) (at [32]-[39]). His Honour also said:
 

 
 
 
 " [40] The general power of the Court to give directions to a liquidator under s 479(3) of the Act will, in my opinion, also allow the Court to approve the liquidator proceeding under an agreement made without the requisite prior approval under s 477(2B). Further, and equivalent to the inherent jurisdiction of the State Supreme Courts, relied upon in Empire (Aust) Nominees Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 324 ; 18 ACLC 738 , is the implied incidental power of this Court to make orders which are necessarily incidental to its express powers.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 1531">There has been a difference of judicial opinion as to whether it is appropriate to extend time in a case such as the present. Orders extending time were made by Warren J (as the Chief Justice then was) in Empire (Aust) Nominees Pty Ltd (in liq) v Vince [2000] VSC 324 ; (2000) 35 ACSR 167 (see [15]-[16]) and by Gordon J in Stewart, in the matter of Newtronics Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1375 (see [30]). However, in Re Read and Another [2007] FCA 1985 ; (2007) 164 FCR 237 ( Read ), French J (as the Chief Justice then was) expressed disagreement with the approach taken in those two cases. His Honour was of the opinion (at [32]-[39]) that s 1322(4)(d) of the Act could not be relied upon to extend time under s 477(2B). French J's reason was that s 477(2B) did not specify a "period for" the making of an application for approval under s 477(2B). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 544">More recently, in Re Read &amp; Another [34] the Federal Court said as follows: Further, and equivalent to the inherent jurisdiction of the State Supreme Courts...is the implied incidental power of this Court to make orders which are necessarily incidental to its express powers. In Jackson v Sterling Industries Ltd [1987] HCA 23 ; [1987] HCA 23 ; (1987) 162 CLR 612 , Deane J (Mason CJ, agreeing) quoted with approval the statement by Bowen CJ in the Full Court of the Federal Court, under appeal (at 623-624): In relation to a statutory court such as the Federal Court it is wise to avoid the use of the words "inherent jurisdiction". Nevertheless, a statutory court which is expressly given certain jurisdiction and powers must exercise that jurisdiction and those powers. In doing so it must be taken to be given by implication whatever jurisdiction or powers may be necessary for the exercise of those expressly conferred. [35] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 471">140 In its notice of motion Meadow Springs sought orders that the Court, under s 1322(4)(d) of the Act, extend the period within which to seek approval of the IMF Funding Agreement, and that the Court approve the IMF Funding Agreement. The notice of motion was amended after the decision in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1985 ( Forestview ) was handed down in December 2007. In that case at [2] to [4], French J observed:
 
 The liquidators now apply to the Court for an extension of the period within which to seek approval of the Agreement from the Court and also ask for an order that the Court approve the Agreement. The extension application is sought under s 1322(4)(d) of the Act.</sentence>
