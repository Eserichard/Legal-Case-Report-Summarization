 [8] The primary judge then analysed the decision with reference to the indicators of a legislative decision in the form expressed by Philip McMurdo J in Braemar Power Project Pty Ltd v The Chief Executive Department of Mines and Energy in his Capacity as the Regulator Under the Electricity Act 1994 (Qld): [66] 
 
"(i) creates new rules of general application, rather than applying existing rules to particular cases;
 
(ii) must be publicly notified in the Gazette or similar publication;
 
(iii) cannot be made until there has first been wide public consultation;
 
(iv) incorporates or has regard to wide policy considerations;
 
(v) can be varied or amended unilaterally by its maker, the analogy being to primary legislation;
 
(vi) cannot be varied or amended by the executive;
 
(vii) is not subject to merits review in a tribunal;
 
(viii) can be reviewed in Parliament (for example, as a disallowable instrument);

(x) has binding effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 361">The objects of the Act are essentially set forth in s 4(1) as follows: 
 
 Objects of Act 
 (1) The objects of this Act are to do the following, so far as the Constitution permits: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) provide for the establishment and maintenance of a national system of controls relating to the quality, safety, efficacy and timely availability of therapeutic goods that are: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) used in Australia, whether produced in Australia or elsewhere; or 
 (ii) exported from Australia; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) to provide a framework for the States and Territories to adopt a uniform approach to control the availability and accessibility, and ensure the safe handling, of poisons in Australia. 
 
 

 
The Act, it may be noted, forms part of the means whereby therapeutic goods are regulated in Australia and is complemented by State and Territory legislation: Roche Products Pty Ltd v National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee [2007] FCA 1352 at [8] , [2007] FCA 1352 ; 163 FCR 451 at 454. In Hui v Lane [2003] SASC 401 , Gray J helpfully reviewed the scheme of the Act as follows: 
 
 
 [33] The Therapeutic Goods Act provides for the establishment and maintenance of a national system of controls relating to the quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods. It covers therapeutic goods supplied in Australia whether those goods are produced in Australia or elsewhere or are exported from Australia.</sentence>
