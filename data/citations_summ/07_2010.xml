<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1490">The proceedings before her Honour concerned an issue relating to the infringement or the alleged infringement of the applicant's registered trademark and alleged misleading and deceptive conduct and matters of that kind. On the question of the principles governing the question of whether or not leave to reopen should be granted, her Honour said: It is not in dispute that the Court has the power to grant leave for further evidence-in-chief to be adduced after the trial of the proceeding has concluded and judgment reserved. Indeed this jurisdiction is well recognised: Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 , Gulf Pacific Pty Ltd v Londish [1992] FCA 502 , Urban Transport Authority of New South Wales v Nweiser (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 , Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 176 CLR 256 , McCarthy v McIntyre [2000] FCA 1250 , Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010. In Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Kenny J conveniently summarised the circumstances in which the Court will permit further evidence to be adduced between conclusion of the hearing and delivery of judgment as follows:
 
 
 
 
 [24] The authorities indicate that, broadly speaking, there are four recognised classes of case in which a court may grant leave to re-open, although these classes overlap and are not exhaustive. These four classes are (1) fresh evidence ( Hughes v Hill [1937] SASR 285 at 287; Smith v New South Wales Bar Assn [No 2] [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 108 ALR 55 at 61---2); (2) inadvertent error ( Brown v Petranker (1991) 22 NSWLR 717 at 728 (application to recall a witness); Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 at 614 (application to tender answers to interrogatories); Henning v Lynch [1974] 2 NSWLR 254 at 259 (application to re-open); (3) mistaken apprehension of the facts ( Urban Transport Authority of NSW v NWEISER (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 (" UTA ") at 478; and (4) mistaken apprehension of the law ( UTA at 478).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1297">The respondents' application for leave to re-open in respect of the amendment of the charges (as in respect of the March 2010 date) was made after a hearing at which evidence was tendered and submissions made by the opposing parties, and the Court had reserved its decision. The jurisdiction is well recognised: Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010 at [18] ; Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 ; and Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 176 CLR 256 at 266-267. In Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 (' Bradshaw ') at [24], I said that:

In every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application for leave to re-open: see UTA at 478; also The Silver Fox Company Pty Ltd as Trustee for the Baker Family Trust v Lenard's Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1310 (" Silver Fox ") at [22] and [25].

 Appeal from a Master 
 
 
 ANDERSON J. 
 
 Introduction 
 This is an appeal from a decision of a master of this court on 31 May 2010. His Honour at [36]-[39] discussed the relevant principles in Re Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (WA Branch); Ex parte Ferguson (1986) 67 ALR 491 , Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010 , and Perpetual Trustee Company Limited &amp; Anor v Valuer-General; Trust Company of Australia Limited &amp; Anor v Valuer-General (No 2) [2007] SASC 340. He cited Toohey J in Re Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union at 493-494 where Toohey J said: 
 
 In situations where a hearing has concluded but judgment has been reserved and not delivered, it has been said that fresh evidence should be admitted only when it is so material that the interests of justice require it; the evidence if believed would most probably affect the result; the evidence could not by reasonable diligence have been discovered before; and perhaps that no prejudice would ensue to the other party by reason of the introduction of the evidence so late ... 
 

The master stated at [40]-[41]:
 
[40] I obtained the consent of both parties to consider Exhibit "KJC-4" to the affidavit of Ms Colmer (FDN 22). This is the proposed affidavit on which the plaintiff would rely if permission was given.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 153">The Court has the power to grant leave for further evidence in chief to be produced after the trial of the proceedings has concluded and while the judgment is reserved. In Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 Muirhead J set out tests he determined were applicable to applications for reopening where fresh evidence sought to be admitted. These included whether the evidence was so material that the interests of justice required that it be admitted, whether the evidence, if believed, would have affected the result, and whether the evidence could not have by reasonable diligence, been discovered before: Gulf Pacific Pty Ltd v Londish [1992] FCA 502 , Urban Transport Authority of NSW v Nweiser (1992) 28 NSW LR 471 , Smith v New South Wales Bar Association (1992) 176 CLR 256 , McCartney v McIntyre [2000] FCA 1250 , Inspector --- General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010.  The degree of relevance and the probative value of the further evidence sought to be adduced and its potential to involve an undue waste of time; vii. The prejudice to the defendant in terms of delay in the completion of the proceeding and the consequential costs; viii. The public interest in the conclusion of litigation [See also Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010 at [48] ]; and ix. What explanation is offered by the plaintiff for not having called the evidence in chief. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] ACTSC 170">The degree of relevance and the probative value of the further evidence sought to be adduced and its potential to involve an undue waste of time; 
 vii. The prejudice to the defendant in terms of delay in the completion of the proceeding and the consequential costs; 
 viii. The public interest in the conclusion of litigation [See also Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010 at [48] ]; and 
 ix. What explanation is offered by the plaintiff for not having called the evidence in chief. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] NSWSC 244"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] NSWSC 132"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 82">So far as the interests of justice are concerned, there is another consideration which is relevant in the context of this particular litigation. It was articulated by Goldberg J in Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd (ACN 004 061 214) v Aconex Pty Ltd (ACN 091 376 091) (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010 at para 48 in these terms: 
 The interests of justice require that commercial litigation of the type in this proceeding should be conducted expeditiously and that parties should only be able, after judgment has been reserved, to re-visit tactical decisions they have made in exceptional circumstances where injustice might otherwise result. No such exceptional circumstances exist in the present case. There needs to be a finality to the process of litigation and a limit on the number of times a party can re-visit issues which have arisen in the course of a trial and have been addressed. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1761">12 It is not in dispute that the Court has the power to grant leave for further evidence-in-chief to be adduced after the trial of the proceeding has concluded and judgment reserved. Indeed this jurisdiction is well recognised: Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 , Gulf Pacific Pty Ltd v Londish [1992] FCA 502 , Urban Transport Authority of New South Wales v Nweiser (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 , Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 176 CLR 256 , McCarthy v McIntyre [2000] FCA 1250 , Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] NSWSC 612">2 For present purposes, the principles governing such an application are to be found in the judgment of Goldberg J in Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010. They may be summarised as follows. The Court has a discretion to grant a party leave to re-open its case after final submissions have been concluded and the Court has reserved its decision. The ultimate question is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application. It is relevant to consider whether prejudice would be occasioned by the late introduction of the evidence to the other party. It will also be relevant to consider the materiality of the proposed additional evidence, and whether it could by reasonable diligence have been discovered before, or at least any explanation for its not having been adduced earlier. If there was a deliberate decision made not to call the evidence when it ought to have been called in the ordinary course of proceedings, that will typically tell decisively against allowing a reopening, although there is no hard and fast rule requiring the Court to reject an application even where the decision not to call a witness or tender a document was a deliberate one. </sentence>
