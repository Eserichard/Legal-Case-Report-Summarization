The evidence must show that there is a recognisable group or society that presently recognises and observes traditional laws and customs in the Determination area. In defining that group or society, the following must also be addressed: That the claim group comprises a society united in and by their acknowledgment and observance of a body of accepted laws and customs; and That the present day body of accepted laws and customs of the society in essence is the same body of laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the ancestors or members of the society adapted to modern circumstances; and That the acknowledgment and observance of those laws and customs has continued substantially uninterrupted by each generation since sovereignty, and that the society has continued to exist throughout that period as a body united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of those laws and customs; and That the claim group still possesses rights and interests under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by them, and that those laws and customs give them a connection to the land.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCAFC 46">However we should first say something about the judgment of the Full Court in Quall FC which McKerracher J relied on, as have the respondents in this appeal. In that appeal, no suggestion was made that issue estoppel had no application in relation to native title cases. The appeal proceeded on the assumption that it did. The applicability of the principle was not in issue. Indeed it is faintly apparent from the reasons of the Full Court at [37] that a question might arise about the applicability of the principle given that the parties in whose favour the principle was said to operate had not all been parties to the earlier proceedings in which the issue founding the estoppel had been decided: see Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404. The Full Court there observed: 
 
 At this point we note that at para 17 of the respondent's written submissions it is stated that "there was one party to the remainder of the application the subject of this appeal who was not a party in Risk". At the hearing of the appeal no mention was made of this party and no point was made in relation to the party. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1472">As mentioned, the State relied on the Quall case. In that case, the Full Court upheld the decision of the primary judge who had summarily dismissed a claim on the grounds that issue estoppel applied in the circumstances of that case. In that case, the native title determination claim was made over a large area of land. The land, the subject of the claim, was later divided into two areas, Area A and Area B. The claim in respect of Area A, was heard first. Mansfield J in Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 , dismissed the claim over Area A because the evidence was insufficient to establish an uninterrupted observance of the traditional laws and customs over the land. Having exhausted all avenues of appeal, the same applicant commenced a claim over Area B in which there were a number of common parties to the claim in respect of Area A. The primary judge found that there was a sufficient commonality in the issue raised in relation to Area B, to give rise to an issue estoppel on the basis of the findings in relation to absence of uninterrupted observance of traditional laws and customs made by Mansfield J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] NSWSC 786">368 In Risk v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 404 , where what was being considered was anthropological evidence relating to an Aboriginal land claim, Mansfield J referred to the notion that science and mathematics were exact disciplines, whereas the disciplines of anthropology, humanity and the like, were not. His Honour said (at [468]):
 
 
 
 In most if not all disciplines, opinion is formed by reasoning drawn from a group of facts. The facts may be drawn from a scientific experiment, historical documents or a series of conversations held with members of a native title claimant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCAFC 157">2 The consolidated proceeding (involving the 19 separation applications) was dismissed by Mansfield J in Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 ( Risk ).

On the application of the Northern Territory, the primary judge summarily dismissed the claim pursuant to O 20 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules on 19 January 2009; Quall v Northern Territory of Australia [2009] FCA 18. This is an appeal from the primary judge's decision.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1200">Before considering the application of those principles in a number of cases, it is necessary to consider a recent similar case. In the recent decision of Quall [2009] FCA 18 , an order similar to that now sought was made by Reeves J. In Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 ( Risk ), parts of native title determination applications relating to a particular area near Darwin described as being 'Area A' had been consolidated into one set of proceedings. The second native title applicant in those proceedings, Mr Quall (on behalf of the Danggalaba and Kulumbiringin People), alleged the existence of a particular Aboriginal society that held native title. However, Mansfield J held, (as did Nicholson J in this case) that a different society to the one alleged by Mr Quall was the relevant society which held native title at sovereignty. His Honour held that society had ceased to hold native title due to a 'substantial interruption' in the observance of traditional laws and customs in the Twentieth Century. Claims over Area A were therefore dismissed. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCAFC 63">

72 In Risk v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 404 at [97(c)] ( Risk TJ ) Mansfield J said that applicants for native title must establish, amongst other things, that
 the acknowledgment and observance of the laws and customs has continued substantially uninterrupted by each generation since sovereignty, and the society has continued to exist throughout that period as a body united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of those laws and customs. 
 

On appeal to the Full Court, the appellants did not attack that formulation, though they did unsuccessfully attack other parts of his Honour's summary of the requirements for establishing native title: Risk v Northern Territory (2007) 240 ALR 75 at [78]- [79]. The Full Court regarded the whole of his Honour's summary, including that quoted above, as an accurate statement of the effect of the cases, including Yorta Yorta HC . See at [78] to [98].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 291">14 It is, therefore, hard to resist the temptation of determining such a fundamental issue as authorisation before a full trial of the native title determination application with the very substantial resources which are then involved. To do so has the attraction of expedition and economy. Certain recent decisions of the Court have illustrated that proper authorisation is a matter which should not be overlooked, and the possibility of a challenge, at an early point in the proceeding: see e.g. Risk v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 404 ; Harrington-Smith v Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31 ; (2007) 238 ALR 1.

<sentence id="cs11" from="[2007] FCAFC 78">215 In considering the respective contentions, and in the light of the authorities which have been discussed, we propose to apply the following general approach. It is largely a matter of common sense, but is founded upon the words of s 47A and s 47B in their context and as considered in the authorities:
 
 (1) to "occupy" an area for the purposes of ss 47A and 47B of the NTA involves the exercise of some physical activity or activities in relation to the area;
 (2) to "occupy" an area does not require the performance of an activity or activities on every part of the land;
 (3) to "occupy" an area does not necessarily involve consistently or repeatedly performing the activity or activities over part of the area;
 (4) to "occupy" an area does not require constant performance of the activity or activities over parts of the area; it is possible to conclude that an area is occupied where there are spasmodic or occasional physical activities carried on over the area;
 (5) to occupy an area at a particular time does not necessarily require contemporaneous activity on that area at the particular time; it is possible to conclude that an area of land is occupied in circumstances where at the time the application is made there is no immediately contemporaneous activity being carried on in the area;
 (6) the fact of occupation does not necessarily entail a frequent physical presence in the area; for example, the storage of sacred objects on the area or the holding, from time to time, of traditional ceremonies on the area may constitute occupation for the purposes of the NTA: see, e.g. Rubibi Community v Western Australia [2001] FCA 607 ; (2001) 112 FCR 409 at [182] ;
 (7) evidence to establish occupation need not necessarily be confined to evidence of activities occurring on the particular area; it may be possible to establish that a particular area is occupied by reference to occupation of a wider area which includes the particular area: Risk [2006] FCA 404 at 890;
 (8) occupation need not be "traditional": Rubibi (No 7) [2006] FCA 459 at [84] ;
 (9) whether occupation has been made out in a particular case is always a question of fact and degree.  210 Whether an area is "occupied" by one or more members of a claim group is a factual inquiry which must be considered in the context of each individual case. It cannot be simply equated with connection: see Risk [2006] FCA 404 at [890] per Mansfield J; Rubibi (No 7) [2006] FCA 459 at [83] per Merkel J. The Ngarluma and Yindjibarndi peoples and the State are agreed that the learned primary judge erred insofar as he held otherwise. The State submitted that by equating occupation with connection, his Honour failed to determine the fact of occupation in relation to the disputed areas, so that s 47B cannot be satisfied in respect of them regardless of whether his Honour also erred in relation to the effect of the temporary reserves. The error of law was said to be one which precluded the primary judge from making the relevant factual findings. 134 The State submitted that insofar as Sundberg J found that the leases held by the ILC and ATSIC fell within s 47A(1)(b)(ii), the decision is distinguishable because in the instant case the pastoral lease and freehold titles are held by a company incorporated under general companies legislation. It also submitted that his Honour's reasoning in respect of the pastoral leases held by the Commonwealth and the Kupungari Aboriginal Corporation (followed in Rubibi (No 7) ) should not be followed; and that the preferable construction of the first limb of s 47A(1)(b)(ii) is that adopted by Olney J in Hayes v Northern Territory [1999] FCA 1248 ; (1999) 97 FCR 32 ( Hayes ) and by Mansfield J in Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 ( Risk ). 207 In Hayes [1999] FCA 1248 ; 97 FCR 32 , Olney J observed at 144, [162] that occupancy of land for the purposes of ss 47A and 47B "should be understood in the sense that the indigenous people have traditionally occupied land. " His Honour expressed the view that the use of particular land by members of the relevant claimant group which is not random nor co-incidental, but in accordance with the traditional way of life, habits, customs and usages of the community is sufficient to indicate occupation of the land. His Honour's views have been approved in several subsequent decisions of this Court: see, e.g. Griffiths v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 903 at [662] and [703]; Risk [2006] FCA 404 at [888] ; Rubibi (No 7) [2006] FCA 459 at [81] . In fact, the objects of the Broome Aboriginal Media Association and Nirrumbuk Aboriginal Corporation state as their main object, inter alia , the provision of 'direct relief from poverty, sickness, suffering, destitution, misfortune, distress and helplessness' of Aboriginal persons in particular regions. The Rules or Constitutions of the associations provide for the property and funds of the association to be available at the discretion of the Committee for the purpose of carrying out the objects. 


 
His Honour then referred to the passage in Neowarra at [706], set out above, and continued (at [97]):
 
 I am not satisfied that his Honour was clearly wrong and, indeed, I am in agreement with his Honour's approach (cf Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 at [881] ). The rules of the association are not relevantly distinguishable from the rules considered by Sundberg J. It must follow that the property of each of the three associations is held by them expressly for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples. 194 The "area" to which s 47B refers is "the particular area in relation to which it has been concluded that, but for the section, native title rights would be extinguished": Neowarra [2003] FCA 1402 at [721] per Sundberg J; see also Risk [2006] FCA 404 at [886] per Mansfield J. In its written submissions on the notice of contention, the State said that there could be no issue regarding the application of s 47B to some of the areas identified by the Ngarluma and Yindjibarndi peoples because there was no extinguishment to be disregarded in any event. Specifically, the State submitted that there was no s 47B issue to be determined in relation to areas 14A, 18A, 138, 139, 173, 193, 196, 321, 368, 381, 391, 417, 493, 494, 539, 540, 541, 543, 544, 545, 546, 563A, 563B and 567 because the primary judge did not find that native title had been extinguished over those areas. 197 The State also said that s 47B would not apply to areas 139, 160, 257, 264, 323, 482- 486, 488-492, 496, 497, 505, 506 and 519 in any event because they are covered by exploration licenses; and would not apply to areas 514, 516, 517 and 518 because they are not unallocated Crown land. And it said that s 47B could not apply to disregard extinguishment in area 160 because native title was extinguished in that area by an act done after the claim was lodged (the creation of Reserve 44292): see Risk [2006] FCA 404 at [905] , where Mansfield J expressed the view that a "prior interest" for the purpose of ss 47A and 47B must be one created before the making of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FCAFC 46">2 The primary judge dismissed the consolidated applications on the ground that the present society, comprising the Larrakia people or else the Danggalaba clan, did not now have the rights and interests possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the Larrakia people at sovereignty, because their current laws and customs were not 'traditional' in the sense required by s 223(1) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act) as explained by the High Court in Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 ( Yorta Yorta ): Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2006] FCA 1243">
 
 
 The evidence of the Aboriginal witnesses about subjects relevant to those issues tended to lock together what the person had learned, or experienced, as a child and the position today. In addressing these questions, I am conscious of the possibility that a native title claim may fail because of a discontinuity in acknowledgement and observance of traditional laws and customs, even though there has been a recent revival of interest in them and there is current acknowledgement and observance. I have in mind cases such as Yorta Yorta and the decision of Mansfield J in Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 (the 'Larrakia case'). Before upholding a native title claim, the Court must be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, of continuity of acknowledgment and observance, by the relevant community, from the date of sovereignty until the present time. Of course, there can never be direct evidence covering such a long time.</sentence>
