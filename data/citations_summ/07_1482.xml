<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 565">2 On 8 August 2007 Cowdroy J made orders under O 15A, r 12: Carey v Carey [2007] FCA 1482. In making those orders, Cowdroy J recounted that the Applicants are the executors of the estate of Grace Dorothy Carey, a retired medical practitioner, and that the Respondent is the brother of the Applicants and a beneficiary of that estate. His Honour concluded:
 [19] The applicants have made inquiries of banking institutions in Sydney and the accountants for the deceased but they have not been able to ascertain any further details of any overseas accounts of the deceased. The Court is satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondent has or is likely to have information relative to the foreign owned assets in accordance with O 15A r 6 of the Rules and that it is in the interests of the administration of justice that the applicants be given the opportunity of obtaining such information. </sentence>
