<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 195">As to the argument about the construction and effect of cl 7.10 and cl 10.7 it is, in my view, clear that cl 7.10 does not prevent a shareholder of the tenant disposing of its shares without the tenant first having offered the residue of the term to the landlord. Clause 10.7 is confined in its operation to assignments and subletting, the subject of cl 10. That is, it does not operate outside that clause. A similar conclusion was reached by Goldberg J in Kawasaki (Australia) Pty Ltd v ARC Strang Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 461 ; (2008) 247 ALR 333 , 344-5 for reasons that I could adopt. Nor, more importantly, does the lease prevent a change in the beneficial ownership of a trust that is the true "owner" of the demised premises. If there can be a change in the beneficial ownership of the trust without triggering cl 7.10, it is difficult to see why a change in shareholding should have a different effect. The result is that the sale to the MRC does not constitute a breach of the lease. Thus, the fourth notice is of no effect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] WASC 96">79 The plaintiffs acknowledge that while the approach taken by the authorities is not uniform, the preponderance of authorities are to the effect that the word 'transfer' or 'dispose' when used in pre-emptive rights provisions in a company's articles of association or constitution relate only to the transfer or disposition of legal title to shares and not of a beneficial or equitable interest in shares: Safeguard Industrial Investments Ltd v National Westminster Bank [1981] 1 WLR 286 , 598, Oliver LJ; Hunter v Hunter [1936] AC 222 ; Hagan v Waterhouse (1992) 34 NSWLR 308 , 388 - 390; and Kawasaki (Australia) Pty Ltd v ARC Strang Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 461 ; (2008) 247 ALR 333 , 348 - 350; Don King Productions Inc v Warren [2000] Ch 291 , 335 - 356; and Secure Parking (WA) Pty Ltd v Wilson [2008] WASCA 268 [100] - [102], Buss JA, but contrast Lyle &amp; Scott Ltd v Scott's Trustees [1959] AC 763 , 778 and 785 where, in the circumstances of that case, it was held that a prohibition in the company's articles on the transfer of shares applied to the disposal of the beneficial interest in the shares. Whether Lyle &amp; Scott Ltd supports the proposition for which the plaintiffs cited it (it was distinguished in Safeguard Industrial Investments Ltd v National Westminster Bank Ltd ) or not is questionable but it certainly did not involve the transfer of shares to an eligible transferee who held them as an express trustee for others. That case involved an enforceable contract of sale by an existing shareholder to purchasers outside the permitted scope of transferees. Lords Reid and Keith rejected a submission that the article prohibiting such a transfer was not infringed unless and until the transferee became the legal owner of the shares by registration on the company register. The argument involved the proposition that, until this point, the vendor remained the registered proprietor of the shares and could remain on the register, attend meetings of the company, and vote at the direction of the purchaser. It might be said that, in such a circumstance, the vendor is a constructive trustee of the property sold for the purchaser until completion but, with all respect, I doubt that their Lordships' remarks should be regarded as extending to a case such as the present where the transferee is an eligible acquirer of the units and the only criticism is that he may hold them as a trustee beneficially for others.</sentence>
