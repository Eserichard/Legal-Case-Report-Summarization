<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1058">On 31 August 2009 declarations of contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) were made. On the day these declarations were sought, an outline of written submissions was provided by Counsel for the Applicant. Written reasons in support of the decision to grant declaratory relief were not sought by the parties. No written reasons have thus been published in support of the relief then granted. But, when granting the declaratory relief, the Court's attention was drawn to the observations of Reeves J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Grove and Edgar Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1956 at [18] to [21] [2008] FCA 1956 ; , [2008] ATPR 42-269 at 49,818 to 49,819 and the approach that should be taken before granting such relief. Reference was also made to the summary of the authorities by Moore J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v AMV Holding Ltd [2009] FCA 605. </sentence>
