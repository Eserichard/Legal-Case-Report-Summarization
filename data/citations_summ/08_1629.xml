<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 278">The applicant contends that there is no doubting the jurisdiction and power of the Court to grant an interlocutory injunction of the type sought. So far as the power of the Court to award such an injunction, attention is drawn in particular to what Le Miere J said in John Holland Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2005) 144 IR 418 ; [2005] WASC 146 ( John Holland ), at [76] --- [77], which was followed in decisions of this Court in CBI Construction Pty Ltd v Abbott (2008) 177 IR 134 ; [2008] FCA 1629 and United Group Resources Pty Ltd v Calabro (No 2) [2010] FCA 71. The applicants also refer to the general principle that the origin of quia timet injunctions may be an illustration of the rule "that prevention is better than cure", as observed by the High Court in Friend v Brooker (2009) 239 CLR 129 ; [2009] HCA 21 , at [52]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 71">Several previous decisions have addressed the question of whether or not the fact that unlawful conduct has ceased should in itself be sufficient to decline the grant of an injunction sought. It has been determined that the fact the unlawful industrial action has ceased is not of itself a reason not to grant an injunction. Examples of such decisions include Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2006) 154 IR 228 ; John Holland Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2005] WASC 146 ; (2005) 144 IR 418 ; United Group Infrastructure ; CBI Construction Pty Ltd v Abbott [2008] FCA 1629 ; (2008) 177 IR 134 ; and Australian Building and Construction Commissioner v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 1092. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1587">As I observed in CBI Construction Pty Ltd v Abbott [2008] FCA 1629 ; (2008) 177 IR 134 at [22] : 
 
 Consideration of the main object is a relevant consideration to the construction and application of the provisions of the BCII Act: United Group Infrastructure Pty Ltd v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (2005) 148 IR 399 at [23]-[25]; Cahill v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 at [50] - [51]. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 86">However, I was referred by counsel for the applicant to the judgment of Gilmour J in CBI Construction Pty Ltd v Abbott [2008] FCA 1629 , in which his Honour considered this point under s 49(3). His Honour said: 
 Section 49(3) confers power to grant an interim injunction without reaching a final decision that a contravention has occurred. 

His Honour relied upon 2 judgments of Le Miere J in the Supreme Court of Western Australia. It is sufficient if I refer to one of them only, namely, Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2006) 149 IR 299. Dealing with the point with which I am presently concerned, Le Miere J said (at par [7]):
 
 In my view, section 49(3) confers upon this court the power to grant an interim injunction without the court being satisfied that a person has contravened the civil penalty provision, that is, reaching a final decision that a contravention has occurred. 

In the circumstances, and for the purposes of today's interim hearing, I am prepared to proceed on the basis of the construction of s 49(3) which attracted itself to Le Miere J and subsequently to Gilmour J. </sentence>
