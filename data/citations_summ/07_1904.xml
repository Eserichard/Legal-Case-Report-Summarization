<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 993">
 


 
30 In ACCC v Telstra Corp Ltd (2007) 244 ALR 470 ; [2007] FCA 1904 Gordon J stated (at [130] - [131]):
 

 
 
 
 "130 Section 84(2)(b) is an enlarging provision intended to widen the common law principles relating to agency rendering a person's conduct that of the company if it can be said to have been "engaged in on behalf of" the company or "at the direction or with the consent or agreement of" a servant of the company: Trade Practices Commission v Sun Alliance Australia Ltd [1994] ATPR 41-286 at 41,848 and the cases cited therein and Lisciandro v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1996) 69 FCR 180 at 188-189 per Ryan and Drummond JJ. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 131 As the express words make clear, s 84(2)(b) of the Act is concerned with both actual and "ostensible or apparent authority": see Freeman &amp; Lockyer (a firm) v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd [1964] 2 QB 480 at 503. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1364">415 There is no doubt that historical performance can be a factor relevant to the reasonableness of a forecast of future performance (see, for example, ACCC v Top Snack Foods Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 752 , ACCC v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 1904 ; [2007] 244 ALR 470). However in determining whether a person had reasonable grounds for expressing an opinion or making a prediction as to a future matter, is necessary to judge the matter as at the date of the representation (see Lyndel Nominees Pty Ltd v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd (1997) 37 IPR 599 at 625, Sykes 88 FCR 511 at 513, City of Botany Council [2001] NSWCA 94 at [83] ). Historical performance is one factor, although it is an important factor. In paras 19(e) and (f) the applicants claim that the respondents had in their possession Packing Shed data computer records which disclosed the matters referred to in paras 19(a), (b) and (c). I have already considered the claims in paras 19(a), (b) and (c) and found that the respondents had reason to distrust the information in the Packing Shed records to which the applicants refer. Further, I do not consider that the applicants have substantiated the "true position" with respect to, inter alia , the Packing Shed records as claimed by the applicants in paras 19(d)-(g). I shall return to this issue later in my judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 2058">
 1 On 6 December 2007, I directed that the Applicant, after conferring with the Respondent, file minutes of orders to give effect to the reasons for judgment delivered on that day: [2007] FCA 1904. The parties are in dispute --- they are unable to agree on the matters or topics to be addressed and they cannot agree on the wording of the declarations and injunctions. 8 There are two matters that must be noted. First, the orders in the form I propose to make refer to the "12 Events" as that term is defined in the reasons for judgment delivered on 6 December 2007: [2007] FCA 1904 at [5] . Although the Applicant did not pursue its claim that the Telstra Website (Event 4) conveyed either of the Coverage Representations (see [64]), the Event did convey the CDMA Comparison Representation (see [139] and [144]). As the reasons for judgment record, the Second Coverage Representation and the CDMA Comparison Representation were artificially divided (see [141]). Accordingly, Event 4 is included in the orders I propose to make.</sentence>
