<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 163">5 The trial was before Conti J. On 7 August 2007, his Honour delivered judgment. His Honour made a declaration that, upon the true construction of the contract and in the events that happened subsequently, the Foundation companies were severally liable to pay to Idoshore an adjustment upwards to the purchase price pursuant to the contract, to the extent appearing in his Honour's reasons for judgment. His Honour ordered that Idoshore provide written calculations to give effect to that declaratory relief. He also ordered each of the Foundation companies to pay to Idoshore the sums of $85,000 and $125,000. He gave directions for submissions on the calculation of interest. He dismissed the cross-claim and invited written submissions as to costs. See Idoshore Pty Limited v IPN Medical Centres (NSW) Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1175. </sentence>
