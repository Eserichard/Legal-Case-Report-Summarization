<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 392">The discretion conferred by O 62 r 4(2)(c) has been frequently invoked. The purpose of the rule is "to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation involved in protracted litigation arising out of taxation" : Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 at 120 per von Doussa J. See also: Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 2059 at [3] per Sackville J. It is not a rule, however, confined to complex litigation: Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 at [189] per Jacobson J. There is " no particular characteristic of a case which must exist before a gross sum costs order can be made ": Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 3) [2006] FCA 916 at [23] per Mansfield J. It is a power, by way only of example, which has frequently been exercised during the course of considering an appeal in migration cases involving the refusal of protection visas: e.g. BZAS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 449 ; SZCAJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 779 ; SZLKH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 745 ; SZNSL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1543. The underlying premise in migration cases for exercising the power may be the appropriateness of such an order being made where a migrant appellant is frequently unrepresented (and may even fail to appear at the hearing) and where the quantum of the costs order sought by a respondent Minister is self-evidently justifiable. </sentence>
