<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1395">The case is not analogous to Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Peto (2006) 152 FCR 362 ; [2006] FCA 516. In that case, Ms Nader (the person proposed to be joined) had signed solicitor's certificates for security to the Commonwealth Bank. Relevant factors against the joinder of Ms Nader included that: - (i) the proceedings had been on foot for some three years, (ii) Ms Nader was an individual litigant who would be sued by a large bank in what was described as "heavy commercial litigation", (iii) the other parties had been involved for "a considerable number of years", and (iv) joinding Ms Nader "would create very substantial practical problems for her lawyers adequately to prepare the matter" (at [68]-[69]). Although it was accepted that there would be prejudice to the bank by reason of Ms Nader not being joined because of the risk of duplication of proceedings, Rares J was satisfied that the interests of justice would be better served by exposing the bank to some prejudice rather than exposing Ms Nader to what his Honour considered to be far more substantive prejudice to her. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1202">Ryan J held in Caboolture Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v White Industries (QLD) Pty Ltd (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Ryan J, 25 May 1988) that the Court's discretion under O 6 r 8 in relation to the joinder of a new party is a wide one. The parties jointly submit that in order to exercise the discretion in favour of the addition of a respondent pursuant to O 6 r 8, the Court must be satisfied that there is an arguable case against that proposed respondent, at least to the standard of being able to resist an application for summary judgment had the proposed respondent been sued in a separate proceeding ( Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Peto (No 2) [2006] FCA 516 ; (2006) 152 FCR 362). The test for a summary dismissal application against a respondent is found in s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ( the FC Act ), which provides relevantly: 
 
 (2) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if: 
 

 
 
 
 (a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and 
 
 

 
 
 
 (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding. 
 
 

 
 
 (3) For the purposes of this section, a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be: 
 

 
 
 
 (a) hopeless; or 
 
 

 
 
 
 (b) bound to fail; 
 
 

 
 
 
 for it to have no reasonable prospect of success.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 127">28 Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Peto (No 2) [2006] FCA 516 ; (2006) 152 FCR 362 (referred to at [15] above) does not assist John Holland. At [35] Rares J referred to the observations of Gleeson CJ in Fernance v Nominal Defendant (1989) 17 NSWLR 710 at 722 that "all matters in dispute in the proceedings" in rule 8(1)(b) is not to be construed as limited to matters arising under the existing pleadings. 15 The expression "either/or" referred to at [13] was used by the primary judge when distinguishing Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Peto (No 2) [2006] FCA 516 ; (2006) 152 FCR 362 upon which John Holland relied. His Honour said that unlike the judge in that case, he was faced with a true "either-or" situation, in which the success of Rail's defence will have the necessary consequence that John Holland was the contravening party "(assuming, for present purposes, that contravention there was)".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 660">John Holland relied also upon the judgment of Rares J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Peto (No. 2) [2006] FCA 516 ; (2006) 152 FCR 362. In that proceeding, the applicant (the Bank) proceeded against two individuals upon mortgages and guarantees which they had given to secure moneys advanced by the Bank to third parties. In their defences, those individuals asserted that the securities which they had executed had not been properly explained to them, and that the Bank had thereby acted in contravention of certain statutory provisions, and in ways which were unconscientious.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 525">They submitted that subrule (ii) was not satisfied because the claims did not arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions. A restrictive approach to this question has generally been taken in this Court: Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Peto (No 2) [2006] FCA 516 ; (2006) 152 FCR 362 at 374 [45] per Rares J. I do not think that that restrictive approach is satisfied in light of my rejection of the argument that the claims against all respondents constituted a single matter. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1770">38 I am satisfied that the allegations of fraud against Mr Bangad in the Suzlon companies' cross-claim, as well as the centrality of his role in the events on which the Suzlon companies rely to seek relief from the Headway companies' claims, make Mr Bangad a proper and necessary party to the proceedings: see News Ltd v Australian Rugby Football League Ltd [1996] FCA 870 ; (1996) 64 FCR 410 at 523G-524F per Lockhart, von Doussa and Sackville JJ; see too Victoria v Sutton [1998] HCA 56 ; (1998) 195 CLR 291 at 316-317, [77] - [78] per McHugh J; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Peto (No 2) [2006] FCA 516 ; (2006) 152 FCR 362 at 370-372 [27] , [30]-[33] per myself.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1331">19 For a consideration of the principles referable to the joinder of third parties under Order 6 rule 8 reference should be made to the judgment of Sheppard J in Trade Practices Commission v Westco Motors (Distributors) Pty. Ltd. [1981] FCA 48 ; (1981) 58 FLR 384 at 385 --- 387; the judgment of the Full Court in News Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited [1996] FCA 870 ; (1996) 64 FCR 410 at 523 --- 525 and the judgment of Rares J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Peto (No 2) [2006] FCA 516 ; (2006) 152 FCR 362 at 368 --- 372.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] VSC 43">20 The joinder discretion is conferred by r 9.02(b) in wide and ample terms, [2] not to be cut down by restrictive interpretation, [3] and is to be exercised, like the general power of amendment, [4] by reference to considerations of procedural convenience, fairness and practicability, on a case by case basis.  26 Delay in making an application for joinder is a relevant but not a decisive consideration. Rules of procedure are not ends in themselves. As the amendment cases show, the purpose of such rules is to promote the just and efficient determination of disputes, not the punishment of parties for inadvertence. [20] In cases of delay, there should be a consideration of the explanation and the prejudice, or lack of it, that a party has or will suffer in consequence. For example, if the delay has resulted in a party being no longer able to call a necessary witness in the proceeding to be joined, this may be a reason to refuse joinder. </sentence>
