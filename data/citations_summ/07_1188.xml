<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1161">An interpretation of the 8202 visa conditions as continuously applicable throughout its currency has also received the support of other judges, including Weinberg J, in Wang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1188. His Honour said: 20 The legislation which relevantly governs the issues raised in this appeal is tolerably clear in its effect. Section 116(1)(b) provides that the Minister may cancel a visa if satisfied that its holder "has not complied with a condition of the visa".</sentence>
