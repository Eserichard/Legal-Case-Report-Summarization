<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 484">The principal orders sought by the plaintiffs in the Amended Notice of Motion were that certain judgments I had given in favour of the third defendant and the fourth defendant respectively, pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), be set aside. My reasons for giving the judgments are set out in Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 56 ('Keynes (No 2)') ; [2009] FCA 567 ; 72 ACSR 264. The plaintiffs sought leave to appeal from my decision in Keynes (No 2) and the Full Court of this Court granted leave but dismissed the appeal: Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd [2010] FCAFC 100 ; [2010] FCAFC 100 ; (2010) 186 FCR 281. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 307">As Lord Woolf said in Swain v Hillman, ...that is not the object of the rule. It is designed to deal with cases that are not fit for trial at all. " Mr White referred to the decision in Keynes and Others v Rural Directions Pty Ltd and Others (No.2) [2009] FCA 567 ; (2009) 72 ACSR 264 at [47] where Justice Besanko held that: "Where the plaintiff's cause of action depends on an arguable question of law then summary judgment may not be entered". Mr White referred to the decision in Fair Work Ombudsman v Maclean Bay Pty Ltd [2010] FCA 1378 at [10] and [11], where Justice Marshall stated: The discretion in s 31A should only be exercised in the clearest of cases, where there is a high degree of certainty that there are no reasonable prospects of a case being prosecuted successfully. 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 304">The Plaintiffs be refused leave to file and serve the Second Amended Statement of Claim against the Fourth Defendant. The plaintiffs seek an order that the above orders be set aside. On 16 June 2009 I made an order as follows: Pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), there be judgment for the fourth defendant against the plaintiffs in proceeding SAD 110 of 2008. 
The plaintiffs seek an order that that order be set aside. My reasons for making the above orders are reported in Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 567 ; 72 ACSR 264. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FCA 155">As Besanko J said in Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 567 at [47] : 
 
 Where the plaintiff's cause of action depends on an arguable question of law then summary judgment may not be entered.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] VSC 473">38 Further, the Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Parties submitted that the powers granted to the Court under s 1022C are additional to and consequential upon the powers granted to it under s 1022B to award loss and damage, enabling the court to make consequential orders it thinks necessary to do justice between the parties. [35] It was submitted that s 1022C of the Act is not a standalone provision under which relief can be sought independently of s 1022B. It was said that an entitlement to relief under s 1022B is a prerequisite to reliance under s 1022C to seek other ancillary orders under s 1022C. More particularly, it was submitted that the "parties" in favour of or against whom relief may be granted under s 1022C are the "parties" subject to, or who obtain the benefit of, s 1022B of the Act. It was said that the words "between the parties" in s 1022C have to be given meaning [36] and, when read in context of Part 7.9 of the Act, particularly s 1022B, must be interpreted to mean the parties in favour of and against whom an award of loss or damage is sought under s 1022B. It was submitted that there is no basis for a wider construction which would permit the court to exercise its power under s 1022C to make an order in favour of a party seeking loss or damage under s 1022B against any third person. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 919">The relevance of issues of fact and questions of law in an application for summary judgment is clearly summarised by Besanko J in Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 567 ; (2009) 72 ACSR 264 at [47] : 
 
 ...It is sufficient for me to say that where a plaintiff's cause of action depends on a triable issue of fact then summary judgment will not be entered. Where the plaintiff's cause of action depends on an arguable question of law then summary judgment may not be entered. However, in the latter case where the court has had the benefit of submissions on the question of law and is able to decide the question then the court may proceed to do so on an application for summary judgment. Of course, the court must be alert to the possibility that, in truth, the determination of the question of law depends on a triable issue of fact. Furthermore, there may be other reasons why, in the particular circumstances of the case, the court will not decide an arguable question of law on an application for summary judgment.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 544">Nonetheless, I respectfully agree with the views expressed by a number of judges of this Court to the effect that I should proceed with caution when dealing with an application of this kind so as to ensure that Noble is not unjustly shut out from litigating an issue that is fairly arguable: see Boston Commercial at [45] to [46] per Rares J; Unit 11 Pty Ltd v Sharpe Partners Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 43 ; (2006) 150 FCR 405 at [64] per Tamberlin J; Granitgard Pty Ltd v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 55 at [9] per Logan J and Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd (No 2) (2009) 72 ACSR 264; [2009] FCA 567 at [47] per Besanko J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCAFC 117">42 In the carefully reasoned judgment of Rares J in Luck v University of Southern Queensland [2009] FCAFC 73 his Honour expressed the opinion that a judgment or order under s 31A(2) that determines that an applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding is interlocutory (at [101]). His Honour carefully reviewed the recent authorities on the question including Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd , White Industries , Berowra Holdings Pty Limited v Gordon [2006] HCA 32 ; (2006) 225 CLR 364 , Simundic v University of Newcastle [2007] FCAFC 144 , Zoia , Re Luck , Cockrell v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 444 , Pham v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCAFC 179 , Owners of The Ship "Shin Kobe Maru" v Empire Shipping Company Inc [1994] HCA 54 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 , Dent v Australian Electoral Commissioner ; [2008] FCAFC 111 ; (2008) 249 ALR 523 , Wills v Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Bonnell v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (No 5) [2008] FCA 991 and Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 567 ; [2009] 72 ACSR 264. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCA 693">My reasons for concluding that Glencore Grain was entitled to summary judgment are set out in Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 567. The present reasons should be read in conjunction with those reasons. In my view, none of the grounds upon which Glencore Grain succeeded are grounds which justify an order that costs be paid by the plaintiffs on an indemnity basis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FCAFC 73">110 In Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at 407-408 [128] Gordon J construed the word "may" in s 31A(1) and (2) as being used in its empowering sense, not in a discretionary sense. Her Honour demonstrated in that part of her reasons that once the moving party on a motion under s 31A had established that the other party had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting or defending the claim or proceedings, the Court had to give the moving party the remedy it sought as provided in s 31A. In other words, once the Court had reached such a finding, the moving party was entitled to judgment in accordance with it. On the other hand, in Bonnell v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (No 5) [2008] FCA 991 at [81] , Graham J held that the word "may" in s 31A confers a discretion: see too Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 567 at [46] - [47] per Besanko J. It is not necessary to reach a final view on this issue in order to deal with this matter.</sentence>
