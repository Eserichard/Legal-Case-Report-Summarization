<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 202">An application to review that subsequent decision of the Tribunal was then filed with the Federal Magistrates Court on 26 June 2009. That Court dismissed the application in October 2009: SZLPN v Minister for Immigration [2009] FMCA 1011. In dismissing the application, the Federal Magistrate adopted a course of incorporating within his reasons for decision substantial extracts from the written submissions as filed on behalf of the Respondent Minister, and incorporated extracts from an affidavit that had been filed by the now Appellant and treated that extract as a submission. Such a practice is to be discouraged: SZMUV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 205. Although the reality may be quite different, such a practice only fosters a belief --- perhaps otherwise unfounded --- that no real, genuine and independent consideration has been given to the merits of the case and the arguments sought to be advanced: cf. Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430 at 441 to 442 per Meagher JA; SZKLO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 735 at [19] to [20]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 107">In some cases it may be apparent that a Federal Magistrate has carefully considered the application being advanced, notwithstanding a deficiency in the reasons provided: See, eg, SZFPA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1220 at [18] to [19]; SZMUV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 205 at [9] to [25]. In other cases the inadequacy in the reasons provided may lead to an appeal being allowed: See, eg, SZKLO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 735 , 247 ALR 582. </sentence>
