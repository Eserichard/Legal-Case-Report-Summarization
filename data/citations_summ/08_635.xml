<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1296">The applicant appealed to the Federal Court. That application was dismissed by Finkelstein J, but his Honour directed that the order not be entered for one month to enable the appellant to get legal advice and, if appropriate, to apply to vacate the dismissal order for the purpose of having the appeal re-heard. That application was made and the applicant was represented at the re-hearing by counsel. The applicant advanced an argument before the Federal Court which he attempted to advance before me today; namely that the Tribunal had failed to provide him with an opportunity to supply additional information. After hearing the arguments Finkelstein J declined to vacate his earlier order [2] . At [11] his Honour found that the Tribunal had not fallen into any error. </sentence>
