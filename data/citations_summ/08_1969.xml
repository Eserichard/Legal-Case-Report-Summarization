<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1403">The Statement of Claim as originally filed did not contain paragraphs 11B and 11C; they were introduced by the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim which was strenuously resisted by ResMed. ResMed objected to that pleading on grounds that included that each of the three categories of legal obligation that relied on the Information identified in paragraph 11B (a) to (m) of the document was not adequately pleaded and particularised. In rejecting ResMed's objection, Lindgren J said, [2008] FCA 1969 at [38] : 
 
 I agree with ResMed that the University must indicate all of the facts, matters and circumstances on which it relies as establishing each of the three categories of legal obligation. However, in my opinion, the University does so. 
 
  Since it was commenced the proceeding has had a chequered history which has included a number of interlocutory applications that have raised issues of pleading and discovery and which have been the subject of three judgments of Lindgren J; see The University of Sydney v ResMed Ltd [2008] FCA 1020 ; The University of Sydney v ResMed Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1969 and The University of Sydney v ResMed Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 527. ResMed, by its Further Amended Notice of Motion filed on 29 November 2010, has raised another interlocutory issue. To understand the issues raised by the notice of motion and the nature of the relief sought it is necessary to give some background information about the proceeding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 527">On 23 December 2008 I granted the University leave to file and serve a second further amended statement of claim (SFASOC) to be consistent with the reasons for judgment that I delivered on that date: see The University of Sydney v ResMed Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1969 (Earlier Reasons). I will use the abbreviated forms of reference that I used in the Earlier Reasons. I directed that any SFASOC be filed and served by 30 January 2009 and that the proceeding be stood over to Friday 6 February 2009 for directions. </sentence>
