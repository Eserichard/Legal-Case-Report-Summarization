<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1462">Justice Rares in Boston 236 ALR at [45] was of the view that, unless there are no real issues of fact --- such that "only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable" --- summary judgment (or dismissal) ought not be given pursuant to s 31A. The Full Court has recently considered the summary judgment standard in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 (Finkelstein , Rares and Gordon JJ) ( Jefferson Ford ). Although different views were taken as to the precise operation of s 31A, the following principles appear to have been endorsed:
 In applying s 31A, the court does not conduct fact finding but must assess the strength of the allegations made by reference to the pleadings, affidavits and any other evidence adduced, in order to determine whether the claim is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial: see Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [23] (Finkelstein J), [74] (Rares J) and [130] (Gordon J); see also Bradken Resources Pty Ltd v Lynx Engineering Consultants Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1257 at [28] (Emmett J); Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd [2008] FCA 1920 at [6] (Finkelstein J). Ultimately, the court must consider whether there are any real, as opposed to fanciful, issues of fact or law that require proper determination at a trial.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 919">As Clear Telecoms submits: 
(a) Section 31A sets a lower bar for obtaining summary judgment than that which applied under authorities such as Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 ( White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [54] per Lindgren J; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 at [124] per Gordon J; also [19] per Finkelstein J). (b) In applying the section, it is necessary to examine critically the case in respect of which summary judgment is sought for the purposes of assessing whether it is sufficiently strong to warrant the matter going to trial (as distinct from hopeless or bound to fail) ( Bradken Resources Pty Ltd v Lynx Engineering Consultants Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1257 ; (2008) 78 IPR 586 at [28] per Emmett J). (c) That a case has no reasonable prospects of success might be established by the failure to plead a reasonable cause of action after ample opportunity to do so ( White Industries at [47]). (d) On the other hand, it might be necessary to decide whether the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment is of sufficient quality and weight for it to be able to succeed at trial ( Jefferson at [23] per Finkelstein J; [126]-[127] per Gordon J). (e) In determining whether a real issue of fact exists such as to preclude summary judgment, the Court must draw all reasonable (as distinct from only plausible) inferences in favour of the party seeking to resist summary judgment ( Jefferson at [132]). (f) What inferences are reasonable to draw will be affected by the seriousness of the allegations under consideration and the gravity of the consequences of any adverse findings that might be made ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Amcor Printing Papers Group Ltd [2000] FCA 17 ; (2000) 169 ALR 344 at [78] per Sackville J; s 140, Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 662">On 4 October 2002, Bradken filed an opposition to the grant of the First Application pursued by Lynx ( the First Opposition ). Four years later, on 10 August 2006, the First Opposition was heard and considered. In the following year, 13 March 2007, the decision of a delegate was issued. The First Opposition was upheld in respect of claims 1, 6, 9, 14 and 30 ( the First Decision ).

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FCA 363">In related proceedings in the New South Wales District Registry, Emmett J delivered reasons on 29 August 2008 ( Bradken Resources Pty Ltd v Lynx Engineering Consultants Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1257). In those proceedings the position of the parties is reversed, at least insofar as Bradken and Lynx are concerned. The New South Wales proceedings are concerned with Australian Patent application no.749848 for an invention entitled 'Side Reinforced Bulk Material Transport Container'. One of the issues in those proceedings is an appeal by Bradken from part of a decision of a delegate of the Commissioner of Patents to reject the opposition to the patent application filed by Bradken. In that proceeding Lynx cross-appeals. The other proceeding is a claim by Bradken that in a letter of 11 October 2007 to BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd, Lynx made unjustifiable threats in contravention of s 128 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 1490">39 More recently, in the case of Bradken Resources Pty Ltd v Lynx Engineering Consultants Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1257 ( Bradken ), Emmett J made observations to similar effect. At [28] he said:
 Bradken's application to strike out paragraphs of the Defence is based on s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Section 31A requires the Court to consider the question of whether there is a real issue of law or fact to be decided. The Court must conduct an enquiry into the merits of the issues of law. While the enquiry should not necessarily be for the purpose of resolving the legal questions, that can be done. The object is not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but whether the argument is sufficiently strong to warrant the matter going to trial. If the Court can resolve contested legal issues at a summary hearing, without undue delay, it may be preferable to do so in the interests of saving costs and time. Where there is a real issue of law, the Court can hear and decide it without the need for a trial or evidence. Once the issues of law are resolved, it may be clear, one way or the other whether the matter should be allowed to go to trial (see Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company Australia Limited [2008] FCAFC 60 at [23] and [131]). </sentence>
