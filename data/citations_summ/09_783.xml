<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 208">Pastor Law's Affidavit purports to provide an expert opinion on the accuracy of the English translations of the Detention Documents in Chinese script which were before the Tribunal. [90] Pastor Law does not depose to being a certified translator. The first respondent does not object to Pastor Law's Affidavit being read on the basis that Pastor Law lacks the requisite expertise to provide an expert opinion as to Mandarin/English translation. Rather, it objects to the whole of Pastor Law's Affidavit on the ground of relevance because: issues about the accuracy of translation of the Detention Documents before the Tribunal relate to the merits of the Tribunal Decision, and hence are irrelevant to both the Extension of Time Application and the Amended Application; and the accuracy of translation of the Detention Documents is irrelevant to a judicial review application unless there is a ground of review alleging that there was deficient translation in the hearing before the Tribunal. [91] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 380">It was not disputed that the principles referred to in Appellant P119/2002 (which have been followed or cited with approval on numerous occasions: for example WALN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 131 ; SZJZE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1653 ; SZJZS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2008) 102 ALD 318 ; [2008] FCA 789 ; SZNCW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 818 ; SZHEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 783 ; SZGSI and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2009) 107 ALD 414 ; [2009] FCA 200) are applicable. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1068">The integers of jurisdictional error arising out of mistranslation as articulated in P119/2002 , as extracted, appeared to have been accepted in a number of Federal Court decisions; WALN v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCAFC 131 per Ryan J (with whom Tamberlin and Middleton JJ agreed at [29]); SZJZE v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1653 per Middleton J and SZJZS v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 789 per Flick J. In this year alone, three Judges of the Federal Court, hearing matters on appeal from this Court, have made direct reference and set out with approval the two criteria referred to in P119/2002. SZNCW v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 818 per Barker J; SZHEW v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 783 per Jagot J, where her Honour said at [49]; This approach reflects the reasoning of Kenny J in Perera v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1999) 92 FCR 6; [1999] FCA 507. " 
and in SZGSI v Minister for Immigration [2009] FCA 200 ; (2009) 107 ALD 414 per McKerracher J. In this Court, Smith FM dealt with an application in which the first ground of review argued that a critical mistranslation occurred in relation to one point.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 878">The applicant has had and took the opportunity to seek judicial review of the Tribunal decision in prior proceedings. He would, were the proceedings to go ahead, face insuperable difficulties in his application under principles of res judicata and Anshun estoppel, given the past final decision on the merits (see SZHEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 783) and the principles in relation to Anshun estoppel considered in Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 242 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10. The cause of action that was dismissed by Scarlett FM was in substance the same as that which the applicant seeks to raise again in the current proceedings. The two proceedings depend upon the same facts and seek review of the same Tribunal decision. </sentence>
