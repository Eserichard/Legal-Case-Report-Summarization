<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 48">The applicant relied on four cases recording prior contraventions of s 43 of the BCII Act by the Union, where the conduct in question occurred prior to 8 March 2007; Stuart-Mahoney ; Cahill v CFMEU (No 3) ; Williams v CFMEU and Draffin v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 243. These contraventions of s 43 of the BCII Act by the Union were recorded after 8 March 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1040">Of course, to say the Union is a large national organisation is not to deny that the Union is a non-profit-making enterprise, a consideration that has sometimes been taken into account in the Union's favour: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2004] FCA 517 at [8] per Gray J; Draffin v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 243 at [44] per Marshall J; and Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 299 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 120"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 650">In developing this contention the CFMEU relied on comments made by Gray J in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing &amp; Kindred Industries Union [2004] FCA 517. In that case, three unions admitted to engaging in conduct in contravention of s 45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and agreed that each union should pay a penalty of $100,000.00. Gray J stated that he would have imposed a penalty considerably less than that agreed and, as the penalties were uniform, considered that no attempt had been made to attribute relative blame amongst the respondents. His Honour noted that: the respondents were "not profit-making enterprises" and did not "engage in the conduct the subject of the proceeding for their own gain, or the gain of their officials"; see also Draffin v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 243 at [44] . the respondents' overriding concern was to protect the employees from possible exploitation in circumstances where their terms and conditions of employment were negotiated on an individual basis; with the exception of a short period, access to the site was not blocked; the respondents had agreed to compensate the operator of the project for its losses; and the respondents were entitled to credit for their cooperation with the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission and for saving public money in relation to the litigation. </sentence>
