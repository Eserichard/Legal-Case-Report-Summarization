<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] ATMO 68">There is a further aspect of this issue. Under the Act, the notion of "ownership" (or "proprietorship" as it was in the previous Trade Marks Act 1955) is embodied in the wording of Section 58. The meaning of this concept is considered by Justice Dixon in Shell Company of Australia Limited v. Rohm and Haas Company [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601 at 625 et seq., by Justice Fullagar in Aston v. Harlee Manufacturing Company (19600 [1960] HCA 47 ; 103 CLR 391 at 398-399 and by Justice Allsop in Colorado Group Limited v. Strandbags Group Pty. Limited [2007] FCAFC 184 ; (2008) AIPC 92-272 at paragraphs 84-87. More recently, the notion of "ownership" has been considered by Justice Collier (at first instance) in Television Food Network, GP v. Food Channel Network Pty. Limited (No. 2) [2009] FCA 271 ; (2009) AIPC 92-339 where (at paragraph 39) her Honour stated as follows: 
It is settled law in Australia that "ownership" of a trade mark, which confers the right to registration under the Act, arises because the claimant for registration is either (or both) the author of the trade mark or first user ( Colorado Group Limited v. Strandbags Group Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 184 ; (2008) AIPC 92-272 ; (2007) 243 ALR 127 per Kenny J at [4]-[5] and Allsop J at [66]-[67]; cf Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (4 th ed, Lawbook Co. 2008) ).

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] ATMO 45">Mr Skelly submitted that the onus is on the opponent to satisfy the Registrar that a ground of opposition has been established. He said it appears that, in the case of an appeal from a decision of the Registrar, it may be necessary to establish that the relevant trade mark should clearly not be registered. In proceedings before the Registrar, however, an opponent needs to satisfy the Registrar on the balance of probabilities. In support of this submission, Mr Skelly cited: Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 45 IPR 411 , Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2002] FCAFC 413 , Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 91 , Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 , Television Food Network, G P V Food Channel Network Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 271 , Chocolaterie Guylian NV v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891.  In the end, it is the similarities of the trade marks and the effects of those on the minds of the purchasers of the goods which I must consider --- the particular differences between the trade marks which have been stressed by the applicant depend on one having the trade marks side by side for a detailed comparison --- that approach is not appropriate for a consideration of deceptive similarity. It is the impression of the trade marks on the minds of the likely market for the goods that I must consider. In Television Food Network, G.P. v Food Channel Network Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 271 ; (2009) 80 IPR 314 Collier J said (at [147]) in relation to the trade marks FOOD NETWORK and FOOD CHANNEL: 
[T]he fact that the word "network" does not sound like "channel", an issue raised by the respondent in written submissions, is in my view irrelevant. As the applicant submits, there are many cases in which relief has been granted in relation to marks which do not sound similar but the allegedly infringing trade mark has been found to be deceptively similar to the claimant's mark (I note, for example, such cases as Re Application by PPI Industries Pty Ltd (1989) 17 IPR 667 (Poly drain and Poly Pipe), Effem Foods Pty Ltd v Wandella Pet Foods Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 767 ; (2006) 69 IPR 243 ("Whackos" and "Dogs go wacko for Schmackos") and Newell v Mattel Inc (2001) 55 IPR 648 (Bar-B-Cute v Barbie) as well as the extensive list of such trade marks and decisions in the Appendix to Shanahan pp 955-982); 
 
[T]he contention of the respondent that trade mark 967804 and the applicant's trade marks are substantially different in appearance, and have no resemblance, is not an answer to a claim of deceptive similarity. That factor is of much greater relevance where the claimant alleges substantial identity between the trade marks under s 44(1). </sentence>

Limited (No. 2) [2009] FCA 271 ; (2009) 80 IPR 314 where Justice Collier (at page 350, paragraph 156) indicated that "It is not in contention that the amended version of s 60 is relevant in these proceedings". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCA 1445">As I have already noted above, the primary judge found for Television. In summary, her Honour held that: 
&#9679; Food Channel was not the owner of the Trade Mark at the date the application was filed (s 58): [2009] FCA 271 at [92] ;
 
&#9679; it was not possible on the evidence to conclude that Channel was the owner of the Trade Mark at that date: [2009] FCA 271 at [92] ;
 
&#9679; even if it could be concluded that Channel was the owner of the Trade Mark at that date, the finding that Food Channel was not the owner of the Trade Mark at that date was a fatal defect in the application: [2009] FCA 271 at [92] ;
 
&#9679; there was no evidence that either Food Channel, or Channel, used, or intended to use, the Trade Mark at any time (s 59): [2009] FCA 271 at [121] ; and
 
&#9679; the Trade Mark was deceptively similar to Television's trade mark (s 44(1)): [2009] FCA 271 at [148] . However, Television was unsuccessful in relation to its grounds under ss 42 and 60 of the Act: see [2009] FCA 271 at [178] and [167] respectively.
  As I have also noted above, in the days immediately before the trial, Mr Lawrence retained counsel and solicitors to act for Channel at the trial. Indeed, it emerges from the final decision, that this did not occur until less than four days before the trial was due to commence on Monday, 17 March 2008: see [2009] FCA 271 at [19].  On 27 March 2009, the primary judge delivered judgment in relation to an appeal by Television Food Network, G.P ("Television") against a decision of a delegate of the Registrar of Trade Marks dismissing Television's opposition to the application by Food Channel Network Pty Ltd ("Channel") to register Trade Mark No 967804 ("the Trade Mark"): [2009] FCA 271.  As well, on the issue of use, or intention to use, her Honour set out ([2009] FCA 271 at [95]) a summary of the relevant principles, including the following (excluding references): the intention must relate to the applicant or an authorised user or potential assignee of the applicant; making an application for registration is prima facie evidence of an intention to use; provided the intention to use is sufficiently definite, it does not matter that the mark will not be used immediately; and the intention, or lack thereof, to which s 59 is directed is a real and definite intention of the applicant for registration, to use the mark publicly as a trade mark, although not necessarily immediately or within a limited time.  The ownership and the use of the Trade Mark were obviously critical issues in the primary judge's final decision. This can be seen from the summary of the final decision set out above (at [33]) and also from the summary of the principles extracted from the relevant authorities set out in the final decision: see [2009] FCA 271 at [39] . For example, on the issue of the ownership of the Trade Mark, her Honour referred to the observations of Finkelstein J in Malibu Boats West, Inc v Catanese (2000) 180 ALR 119 at [25], as follows (excluding references): 
 
 ... In the case of a mark that has never been used, the proprietor is the person who is the "author" of the mark and who has applied for its registration with the intention of using the mark: ... Authorship in this context is not confined to the person who originated the mark. A person may be the author even if he has copied a foreign mark; he or she need only be the first person to have applied the mark in Australia: ... A person is also the proprietor of a mark if, at the time of application for registration, he or she is entitled to the exclusive use of that mark under the common law: ... At common law that is the person who first used the mark. 
 
  As I have already noted above, the primary judge found for Television. In summary, her Honour held that: 
&#9679; Food Channel was not the owner of the Trade Mark at the date the application was filed (s 58): [2009] FCA 271 at [92] ;
 
&#9679; it was not possible on the evidence to conclude that Channel was the owner of the Trade Mark at that date: [2009] FCA 271 at [92] ;
 
&#9679; even if it could be concluded that Channel was the owner of the Trade Mark at that date, the finding that Food Channel was not the owner of the Trade Mark at that date was a fatal defect in the application: [2009] FCA 271 at [92] ;
 
&#9679; there was no evidence that either Food Channel, or Channel, used, or intended to use, the Trade Mark at any time (s 59): [2009] FCA 271 at [121] ; and
 
&#9679; the Trade Mark was deceptively similar to Television's trade mark (s 44(1)): [2009] FCA 271 at [148] . However, Television was unsuccessful in relation to its grounds under ss 42 and 60 of the Act: see [2009] FCA 271 at [178] and [167] respectively.
