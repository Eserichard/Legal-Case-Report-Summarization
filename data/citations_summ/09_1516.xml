<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 174">The learned federal magistrate observed of that particular provision that it confers, "A broad discretion": see para 25. In so doing, the learned federal magistrate voiced an opinion in accord with that later given, in respect of that provision, by Collier J in Hu v Commonwealth Ombudsman (2009) FCA 1516. It is apparent from oral submissions made by Mr Hu today that he is of the view that the Ombudsman ought, notwithstanding an opinion formed for the purposes of s 6(1) , nonetheless to have conceived an obligation to investigate arising from s 6(1C) of the Ombudsman Act . </sentence>
