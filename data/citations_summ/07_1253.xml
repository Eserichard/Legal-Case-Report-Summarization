<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 809">Further, it is doubted that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain a damages claim, for the reasons concerning the Court's limited jurisdiction to entertain such private damages claims as explained in Pickering v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 1253 and Pickering v Centrelink [2008] FCA 561.  In Pickering v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 1253 the Court, in proceeding WAD 226 of 2006 (the 2006 DEWR proceeding), dismissed a separate proceeding in which Mr Pickering sought damages from the respondent (identified in his application as the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations) in the sum of $520,000.00, because the Department "refused to help him get a job in Albany". The Court found it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the application (at [9-13]), and that there was no reasonable prospect of the applicant successfully prosecuting his claim for damages (at [14-17]). However the Court said that, if it had found that it had jurisdiction to deal with the application, it would not have dismissed the application on the basis that there was no factual foundation to the claim (at [18-25]). Rather the disputed factual matters would need to be determined by the Court following a trial. </sentence>
