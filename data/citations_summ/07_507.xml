<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1004">Pleadings' issues may fall into the category of substantive rights. In Bond v Barry [2007] FCA 2034 ; (2007) 74 IPR 504 , Gilmour J dealt with an application for leave to appeal from a decision of French J to strike out a statement of claim stating: 
 
 27 The judgment, whilst interlocutory, is one on points of substance and not merely practice or procedure. A distinction is drawn between these: Yap v Granich &amp; Associates [2001] FCA 1735 at [6] ; Dunstan v Orr [2007] FCA 873 at [6] ; see also Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2007) 161 FCR 122 [2007] FCAFC 147 at [39] per Lander J with Moore J concurring. In a case where judgment has the practical effect of finally determining a party's rights, a prima facie case exists for granting leave to appeal: Duncan v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2007] FCA 507 at [18] . 
 

 
 
 28 In this case, the practical effect of the decision prevents the first and second applicants from ever pursuing a claim for damages for breach of s 52 of the Act (and equivalent provisions in the Fair Trading Acts) arising out of the conduct referred to in the applicants' statement of claim.

 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CENTRELINK 
Respondent
 
 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Appeal 
 The applicant, Mr Duncan, has appealed a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by Senior Member 
Mr S Penglis given on 15 December 2006 in which the Tribunal affirmed the reviewable decision in W2002/409 [1] . The Appeal was filed under s.44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). [2] The Appeal is the latest in a long line of litigation involving 
Mr Duncan and Centrelink. [3] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 60">161 There is limited authority in Australia on the finality of a summary judgment order: see eg Schiffer v Pattison [2005] FCA 494 ; (2005) 143 FCR 328 at [56] - [64]. In Schiffer , the court attempted to distinguish between summary orders granted in favour of an applicant as opposed to those granted in favour of respondents. Other cases have attempted to address the question by treating the summary judgment order as "effectively final" such that "a prima facie case exists for granting leave to appeal": Duncan v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2007] FCA 507 at [18] quoting Ex parte Bucknell [1936] HCA 67 ; (1936) 56 CLR 221 at 225; see also Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 195 at [32] ; Paramasivan v Flynn [1998] FCA 1711 ; [1998] FCA 1711 ; (1998) 90 FCR 489 at 492-493. Such fine gradations and doctrinal distinctions are unnecessary - either an order finally disposes of the parties' substantive rights, in which case an appeal lies as of right, or it does not, in which case appeal is a matter of discretion rather than right. Moreover, these approaches misconceive the nature of summary judgment, at least to the extent that they rest upon the view "that no final disposition of rights occurs because there has been no adjudication of the controversy of fact nor a dispositive application of the law to the facts as found": Rogers [2007] FCA 195 at [32] . As noted above, the whole point of summary judgment is to dispose of claims on the merits, as a matter of law, precisely because there is no relevant controversy of fact such as to make a full evidentiary proceeding necessary. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 2034">27 The judgment, whilst interlocutory, is one on points of substance and not merely practice or procedure. A distinction is drawn between these: Yap v Granich &amp; Associates [2001] FCA 1735 at [6] ; Dunstan v Orr [2007] FCA 873 at [6] ; see also Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 147 at [39] per Lander J with Moore J concurring. In a case where judgment has the practical effect of finally determining a party's rights, a prima facie case exists for granting leave to appeal: Ian Duncan v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2007] FCA 507 at [18] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1823">32 I would think it likely that leave to appeal will be granted. The judgment, whilst interlocutory, is one on points of substance: Yap v Granich &amp; Associates [2001] FCA 1735 ; Dunstan v Orr [2007] FCA 873 at [6] ; Duncan v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2007] FCA 507 at [18] . </sentence>
