<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1231">That principle has been reiterated in a number of cases and has a sound juridical foundation: Chapter 5C of the Act regulates managed investment schemes: National Australia Bank Ltd v Norman [2009] FCAFC 152 ; (2009) 180 FCR 243 at [118] ; "Managed investment scheme", but not "scheme", is defined in s 9 of the Act. "Scheme property" of a registered scheme is defined broadly in s 9 of the Act. Attempts to define or describe a "scheme" have resulted in a number of formulations (for example, Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Takaran Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 834 ; (2002) 170 FLR 388 at [15] ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [2] , citing Takaran at [16]; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Primelife Corp Ltd [2006] FCA 1072 ; (2006) 235 ALR 328 at [33] ; Norman at [125] --- [126] citing Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v A-G (NSW); Ex rel CAC [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121 at 129; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Enterprise Solutions 2000 Pty Ltd (1999) 33 ACSR 403 ; Knightsbridge Managed Funds [2001] WASC 339 at [45] ). In the end, the statutory definitions that do exist show that a "scheme", in the context of a managed investment scheme, contains some essential elements --- a coherent and defined purpose, in the form of a "programme" or "plan of action", coupled with a series of steps or course of conduct to effectuate the purpose and pursue the programme or plan and a pooling of contributors' funds or of a "common enterprise" as between the contributors. As Keane JA explained in Mier at [26]: 
 
 
 [T]here can be no doubt that the scheme property of an unregistered scheme is to be identified by reference to the terms of the scheme in relation to the contribution of assets to the enterprise involved in the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1047">In some cases , the scope of the scheme will readily be gathered from some constitutive document in the nature of a blueprint setting out all relevant matters . 
 

 
 
 [128] Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [2] , citing Takaran [2002] NSWSC 834 ; 170 FLR 388 at [16] observed that a "scheme ... is the combination of these things necessarily connected by design", while "[t]he scheme may also include those things or attributes that 'contribute to the coherence and completeness' of the three essential elements". Goldberg J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Primelife Corp Ltd [2006] FCA 1072 ; [2006] FCA 1072 ; (2006) 235 ALR 328 at [33] described a scheme as "a network of contractual rights and contractual obligations".

 PARTIES' POSITIONS
 
 14 ASIC contends each of the schemes listed in Schedule 1 was an unregistered managed investment scheme which was required to be registered (a) because of the terms of the joint venture agreements (see [9] and [10] above); (b) each scheme either has more than 20 members or was promoted by a person who was, when the scheme was promoted, in the business of promoting managed investment schemes, namely Mr Letten; (c) was operating; and (d) was required to be registered by the Act but was not registered.</sentence>

128 Finkelstein J in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1415 ; (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [2] , citing Takaran 43 ACSR at [16] observed that a "scheme ... is the combination of these things necessarily connected by design" , while "[t]he scheme may also include those things or attributes that 'contribute to the coherence and completeness' of the three essential elements". Goldberg J in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Primelife Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 1072 ; (2006) 235 ALR 328 at [33] described a scheme as "a network of contractual rights and contractual obligations". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] VSC 552">28 In Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Primelife Corporation Ltd [2] Goldberg J said that, 
 
 Essentially a managed investment scheme that falls within the definition may be described as a network of contractual rights and contractual obligations. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] WASC 85">46 An example of a case where an undertaking was not required is the decision of Goldberg J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Prime Life Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 1072. His Honour held that the scope and content of s 601EE(2) (a section analogous to s 447A) was wide enough to permit an order in the nature of an interlocutory injunction to preserve assets of the managed investment scheme for so long as was needed for the liquidator to be in a position to make an informed judgment on how best to deal with the asset. His Honour felt that the order could be made without an undertaking as to damages being provided. It was the facts of the case which were determinative as to whether or not the undertaking ought to be required.</sentence>

21 The scope of the definition of a 'managed investment scheme' has been considered in a number of cases. In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Takaran Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 834 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 46 , Barrett J adopted the description and explanation of a 'managed investment scheme and its components' in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Knightsbridge Managed Funds Ltd [2001] WASC 339 at [45] - [49] and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 310 ; (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at [26] - [32] . Justice Goldberg in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Primelife [2006] FCA 1072 ; (2006) 235 ALR 328 agreed with and adopted those descriptions and I would be content to do likewise.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] AATA 1305">Instead it provides that the Court may make any orders it considers appropriate for the winding up. The Court's power under s 601EE(2) has been considered in previous authorities which have been considered by Goldberg J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Primelife Corporation Limited. [193] He did so after considering what a managed investment scheme. He referred to the definition in s 9 of the Act as well as to the descriptions and explanations of a managed investment scheme given in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Knightsbridge Managed Funds Ltd [194] and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Group Pty Ltd [195] and approved in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Takaran Pty Ltd. [196] Goldberg J concluded that:
 
" Essentially a managed investment scheme that falls within this definition may be described as a network of contractual rights and contractual obligations. ... " [197] 
 
 
138. Therefore, a Court could grant an injunction restraining a person with whom the investors or participants have contractual or property relationships from affecting, terminating or dealing with an asset of the scheme. [199] Goldberg J suggested that an injunction should be given only for so long as the liquidator required to make an informed judgment as to how best to deal with an asset. [200] 
 
 
139. In view of these powers, it seems to me that it would be presumptuous of me to conclude in this case that the interests of the remaining nine investors would be prejudiced by the winding up of Brighton JV if it were not granted exemption from registration. The resumption of the winding up proceedings that ASIC has already instituted in the Federal Court would be very close to the time at which the Varied Primelife Agreements will be fulfilled and Brighton JV is planned to conclude. [193] He did so after considering what a managed investment scheme. He referred to the definition in s 9 of the Act as well as to the descriptions and explanations of a managed investment scheme given in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Knightsbridge Managed Funds Ltd [194] and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Group Pty Ltd [195] and approved in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Takaran Pty Ltd. [196] Goldberg J concluded that:
 
" Essentially a managed investment scheme that falls within this definition may be described as a network of contractual rights and contractual obligations. ... " [197] 
 
 
138. His Honour then considered the Court's power to wind up in light of that description:
 
"... In the present case the network of rights and obligations within the scheme includes those under the sale contract which is presently executory and uncompleted. That sale contract and the rights and obligations under it comprise an integral and important asset of the schemes. Thus in considering whether the Court should exercise any power in relation to the sale contract pursuant to s 601EE(2), it is a mis-characterisation of it to describe it only, or simply, as the subject matter of a substantive third party right. It comprises an asset of the schemes which has to be considered by the liquidator and resolved by him either by completion, termination or compromise. " [198] 
 
 
While the purpose of the power given by s 601EE(2) is to wind up an unregistered management scheme, its scope is wide enough to permit the Court to grant an injunction to ensure that the assets of the scheme are preserved while the liquidator works out how best to deal with those assets for the purpose of the winding up and in the interests of the creditors and investors in the scheme. Therefore, a Court could grant an injunction restraining a person with whom the investors or participants have contractual or property relationships from affecting, terminating or dealing with an asset of the scheme. [199] Goldberg J suggested that an injunction should be given only for so long as the liquidator required to make an informed judgment as to how best to deal with an asset. " [198]
