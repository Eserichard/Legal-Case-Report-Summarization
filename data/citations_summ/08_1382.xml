<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 660">1) [1983] 2 Qd R 243 , 248; Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd (Receivers Appointed) [1985] 2 NSWLR 685 , 695. It necessarily follows that a stay will not be granted if an appeal has no prospect of success: Australian Workers' Union v Pilkington (Aust) Ltd [2000] FCA 1169 ; (2000) 101 FCR 35 , 43. 
 

 
These principles were applied in Harbour City Real Estate Pty Ltd (t/as Re/Max Harbour City Real Estate) v Cargill [2008] FCA 1382 at [11] per McKerracher J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 821">The application is made pursuant to O 52 r 17 of the Federal Court Rules . The principles upon which a stay should be granted are relatively straight forward and have been enunciated most recently in the decisions of Finkelstein J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v BMW (Australia) Limited (No 2) [2003] FCA 864 at [5] , McKerracher J in Harbour City Real Estate Pty Ltd t/as Re/Max Harbour City Real Estate (ACN 111 210 023) v Cargill [2008] FCA 1382 at [5] and Greenwood J in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd (ACN 110 855 359) v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (ACN 095 659 733) [2008] FCA 1867 at [39] - [44]. I propose to apply those principles. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 669">Judgment was given in favour of Ms Cargill. In the IM Court her Honour required sums totalling $40,014.54 to be paid by the appellants (Harbour City and Ms Robertson) to Ms Cargill. On 9 September 2008, I ordered that those sums should be held on trust pending the outcome of this appeal ( Harbour City Real Estate Pty Ltd t/as Re/Max Harbour City Real Estate (ACN 111 210 023) v Cargill [2008] FCA 1382). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1628">1 In Harbour City Real Estate Pty Ltd t/as Re/Max Harbour City Real Estate (ACN 111 210 023) v Cargill [2008] FCA 1382 ( Harbour City Real Estate No 1 ), I ordered that the judgment sum awarded in the Industrial Magistrates Court of Western Australia ( Jane Christine Cargill v Re/Max Harbour City Real Estate Pty Ltd and Cecily Robertson [2008] WAIRComm 354 and Jane Christine Cargill v Re/Max Harbour City Real Estate Pty Ltd and Cecily Robertson [2008] WAIRComm 355) be paid into either a joint trust account or into the Federal Court of Australia Litigants' Fund. That order operated as a conditional stay of execution of the judgment. The parties have agreed on payment of the judgment sum into a joint interest bearing account. 
 
11 For the foregoing reasons I will order that:
 
1. There be no order as to costs in relation to the orders of 9 September 2008 made in Harbour City Real Estate Pty Ltd t/as Re/Max Harbour City Real Estate (ACN 111 210 023) v Cargill [2008] FCA 1382.
