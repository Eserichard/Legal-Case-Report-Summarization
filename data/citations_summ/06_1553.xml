<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1618">18 The respondents also argue that even if the bankrupt was the beneficial owner of the land at the relevant time when the Paterson Charge was granted and the Charge was granted at his instruction and direction, he did not 'do anything' that resulted in the charge over the property. For this submission, the respondents draw on a passage in Peldan [2006] HCA 48 ; 227 CLR 471 at [25] - [30]. Reliance is also placed on In the matter of Rose, a bankrupt; Whitton v Regis Towers Real Estate Pty Ltd (in administration) [2006] FCA 1553 at [156] - [161] upheld on appeal in Whitton v Regis Towers Real Estate Pty Ltd (in administration) [2007] FCAFC 125 ; (2007) 161 FCR 20 at [49] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 125">6 Two appeals are involved because the competing relief sought by each side in the proceedings below was rejected in each case by the primary judge ( In the matter of Rose, A Bankrupt; Whitton v Regis Towers Real Estate Pty Ltd (In administration) [2006] FCA 1553) who later ordered that there be no order in respect of costs ( In the matter of Rose, a Bankrupt; Whitton v Regis Towers Real Estate Pty Ltd (In administration) (No 2) [2006] FCA 1734). There is also a cross-appeal by the administrator against the trustee on the question of costs in the trustee's application at first instance. For convenience in these reasons for judgment I will refer to the bankrupt as 'Mr Rose', Mr Whitton, his trustee, as 'the trustee', the company in liquidation as 'Regis Towers' and its administrator Mr Godfrey as 'the administrator',</sentence>
