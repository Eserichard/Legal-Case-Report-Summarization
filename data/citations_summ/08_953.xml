<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] QCA 182">" [40] In support of that conclusion the primary judge referred to authority upon the construction of the Act, [41] and other legislation concerned with electoral challenges, [42] and to the underlying statutory policy which her Honour discerned in the EARC Report discussed earlier in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] QSC 164"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] QSC 138"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] WASC 138">80 More recently, judges of the Federal Court, sitting as the Commonwealth Court of Disputed Returns, have confirmed, and acted upon, the line of authority which establishes that after the time within which a petition must be filed, no amendment can be made for the purpose of overcoming a failure to comply with the requirements of s 355 of the Commonwealth Act (see Wheeley v Australian Electoral Commission [2005] FCA 473 and Smith v Australian Electoral Commission [2008] FCA 953). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 487">On 20 April 2009, directions were made in this Court to accommodate the hearing of the summons in advance of the hearing of the petition. A like course, it may be noted, was pursued by Her Honour Justice Bennett in Smith v Australian Electoral Commission [2008] FCA 953 , 104 ALD 395. To entertain the Corporation's summons in advance of the hearing leaves outstanding a request made by the Petitioner for the production by the Corporation of a substantial number of documents. The production of those documents, upon the case for the Corporation, is unnecessary and irrelevant.  During oral submissions, the Petitioner identified the person who it was said published the electoral advertisement as Mr Oakeshott --- but the facts have to be in the petition and not oral submissions. And there is also an absence of any fact set forth in the petition upon which any view at all could be formed as to the effect of any such practice upon the election. Those facts must also be set forth in the petition: Smith v Australian Electoral Commission [2008] FCA 953 , 104 ALD 395. Bennett J there concluded:
 
[15] Whether or not the requirements of s 355(a) are complied with is to be determined solely by reference to what appears on the face of the petition ( Wheeley v Australian Electoral Commission [2005] FCA 473 at [13] per Kiefel J). In the present case there are no facts set out or assertions made in the petition as to the likely outcome of the election other than the possibility that, because of a preference deal, the quota or a Senate position may have been achieved for some other, unspecified, group. The " very minimum assertion necessary to constitute a fact which will 'invalidate [an] election or return' for the purposes of s 355(a) of the Act is one raising a matter or matters by which 'the election was likely to be affected' ": Webster v Deahm [1993] HCA 38 ; (1993) 116 ALR 223 at 225 per Gaudron J. See also: Smith v Australian Electoral Commission [2008] FCA 953 at [9] and [14] [2008] FCA 953 ; , 104 ALD 395 at 397 and 398. For the purposes of s 362(3) and the phrase " likely to be affected ", in Kelly v Campbell [2002] FCA 1125 , Madgwick J observed: 
[20] ... It seems to me that the facts set out in the petition must be such, if true, as would indicate that there is a real chance that the result of the election would have been different if the allegedly illegal practice had not occurred. It is in that sense that I think the word "likely" should be understood. The present petition has not provided that " very minimum assertion " in respect to any fact or facts that may be discerned. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] QSC 109">As Bennett J held in Smith v Australian Electoral Commission [2008] FCA 953 at [18] such a defect would not be capable of being cured by amendment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCAFC 43">24 On 27 June 2008 Bennett J dismissed the petition because it failed to comply with the requirements of s 355 of the Act ( Smith v Australian Electoral Commission [2008] FCA 953). Section 358(1) of the Act provides that there may be no proceedings on a petition unless it complies with s 355. Section 355(a) requires that a petition set out the facts relied on. Bennett J concluded that the facts were not adequately set out in the petition, that no amendment was permissible for reasons she explained and that a limited power granted by s 358(2) to overlook inadequate particulars was of no assistance to Mr Smith because of an overall failure to show how the result of the election might have been affected by the matters which he asserted (see s 362(3) of the Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1310">1 On 27 June 2008 I delivered judgment in Smith v Australian Electoral Commission [2008] FCA 953. Mr Smith filed a petition on 25 January 2008 under s 355 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) ('the Act') in respect of the half Senate election held on 24 November 2007 ('the election'). Mr Smith was the No 1 Senate candidate for The Fishing Party, contesting the election in the above the line group ticket G. He alleged in his petition that the Australian Electoral Commission ('the Commission') had registered a political party, the Australian Fishing and Lifestyle Party, that contested the election and obtained its registration by "fraud or misrepresentation". The petition was filed in the High Court as the Court of Disputed Returns (s 354 of the Act) and the matter was referred to this Court on the application of the Commission.</sentence>
