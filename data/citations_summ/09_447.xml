<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1172">By my reasons of 5 May 2009 ( Worldwide Timber Traders Pty Ltd (ABN 93 009 384) v Brouwer (No 2) [2009] FCA 447) , I recorded the power of the Court to enforce settlement agreements. In those reasons I indicated that the only difficulty in enforcing the agreement which had been reached between the parties and which was admitted in open Court was in the terms of the draft deed presented on behalf of the applicant. It had been a term of the Settlement Agreement that the parties enter into a deed requiring the respondents to pay to the applicant the sum of $17,500. I ruled that there was an implicit term that the payment be made within a reasonable period of time of the execution of the Agreement. </sentence>
