<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1063">Insofar as the applicant takes issue with the Tribunal's consideration of independent country information in relation to the situation in Bangladesh, the choice and weight to be attributed to items of country information are matters for the Tribunal (see SZIJG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1652). It is apparent that the Tribunal took into account the most recently available country information in relation to the situation in Bangladesh (see SZIGH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1885). This ground is not made out. Section 424 of the Migration Act 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 707">Insofar as the applicant raised the issue of country information, he did provide a number of items of country information in connection with his protection visa application. However, as is apparent from the Tribunal reasons for decision, it put to him a number of items of independent country information from a variety of sources which, as set out above, formed the basis for its conclusions. It is well established that the weight to be given to various items of country information and whether country information should be accepted as accurate is a matter for the Tribunal (see QAAT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 968 ; [2005] FCA 968 ; (2005) 149 FCR 299) and that the choice and interpretation of country information is a factual matter for the Tribunal (see SZIJG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1652). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 290">It was open to the Tribunal on the material before it to reach the conclusion that it did. The weight to be given to particular items of independent country information is a matter for the Tribunal (see NARD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 27 , and also see QAAT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 149 FCR 299) and the choice and interpretation of country information is a factual matter for the Tribunal alone ( SZIJG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1652). No jurisdictional error is established on the basis contended for in ground three of the application or by the applicant's oral submissions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1589">However, as the first respondent contended, the weight to be given to a particular item of country information is a matter for the Tribunal. It is not a jurisdictional error for the Tribunal " to base a decision on country information" that is not true, and the question of the accuracy of such information is one for the Tribunal ( NAHI at [10] --- [12]). Not only the choice but also the interpretation of country information is " a factual matter for the Tribunal alone" ( SZIJG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1652 at [20] per Middelton J). The Tribunal's decision to place no weight on the independent country information provided after the hearing cannot be said to be a failure to have regard to relevant considerations. I note that there was other independent country information before the Tribunal to the effect that there were significant differences between the Sindhi Diaspora in India and Hindus who continued to live in Sindh in Pakistan, in particular the 2007 study by Professor Daniel Gold of an area in India to which both Sindhi and Maharashtrian communities had migrated, which pointed out that for both Maharashtrians and Sindhis the caste or caste-like distinctions now found in the communities were no longer quite what they had been in their homelands, having been transformed by different experiences of Diaspora. The information before the Tribunal also contained the view that caste had ceased to be important for the Sindhis who had been integrated into the Hindu society of independent India as one caste. </sentence>
