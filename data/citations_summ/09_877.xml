<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 553">The Court wishes to emphasise that an appeal to the Full Court in a refugee matter should not be taken as an occasion to re-consider the Tribunal's reasons as distinct from considering the primary judge's reasons. 
 

 
These observations have long been applied and followed by subsequent decisions of this Court: eg, SZDJQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 533 at [7] per Bennett J; SZLYI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1809 at [16] per Middleton J; SZMSW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 576 at [19] per Cowdroy J; SZOBH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 776 at [22] per Reeves J. A failure to allege appellable error on the part of the Federal Magistrate " is not a mere matter of form as no original jurisdiction is vested in this Court to review errors perceived to have been committed by the Tribunal ": SZMSZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 877 at [6] .
