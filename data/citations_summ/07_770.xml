<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 408">The 1% of equity value referred to in the Guidance Note is by way of guidance as to what would be a reasonable fee taking into account the expenditure incurred, in this case, by Ebro and whether the amount would be likely to deter competing offers or impose pressure on Shareholders to vote in favour of the proposal. In this case the fact that the fee is not payable if the Scheme fails for lack of Shareholder approval means that there is no likelihood of the latter problem. In my view the increase in the percentage of equity value represented by the break fee is so small as to be immaterial and would be unlikely to deter a competing proposal. See generally Re APN News &amp; Media Limited (2007) 62 ACSR 400 , [2007] FCA 770 at [43] - [[54]. The break fee is disclosed clearly and in some detail in the Scheme Booklet at 9.14 and 12.4. No shop, no talk
  The risk of Shareholders suffering a delay or default in payment of the Scheme Consideration is adequately addressed by the timing of payments described above. As the issue of C Class shares and the transfer of shares will not occur until Ebro has made the necessary payments as described above, Shareholders are protected from such delays or default; Re SFE Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 670 , (2006) 59 ACSR 82 at [4] and Re APN News &amp; Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [23] . Although Ebro has guaranteed performance of its obligations under the Scheme by delivery to SunRice of an executed Deed Poll in favour of SunRice Shareholders, the timing of payments and transfers is such that Shareholders are unlikely to have to rely on that guarantee. </sentence>

Tax Implications of the Scheme
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 1388">In particular the Merger Implementation Deed between Provet, HSI and Pelican provides for a break fee of $925,000 to be paid if the Scheme does not proceed in certain circumstances. Those circumstances do not include a majority of the Provet shareholders voting against the Scheme. In relation to the question of break fee provisions I respectfully adopt the views expressed by Lindgren J in Re APN News &amp; Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 , (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [43] - [55].. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 1193">It was an issue of that type to which Lindgren J referred in Re APN News &amp; Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [52] which caused me to give some consideration to the issue. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] VSC 456">15 The Scheme Implementation Deed between AWB and Agrium requires a "break fee" of $12.26m (exclusive of GST) to be paid by AWB if the scheme is not implemented in certain circumstances. Where, as here, the break fee is not more than 1% of the equity value of the scheme company, the courts have been willing to make orders for the convening of the first meeting of shareholders. The relevant issue is whether the liability to pay the break fee would be likely to coerce the scheme company's shareholders into agreeing to the scheme or to deter other companies from making a competing offer. [11] Here, the break fee is not likely to coerce AWB shareholders into agreeing to the proposed scheme. The break fee is not payable if the shareholders do not vote in favour of the proposed scheme. Further, the potential break fee is not so large that it is likely to deter other companies from making a competing offer. The break fee provision has been sufficiently disclosed in the scheme booklet. 
 
  12 There is to be a deemed warranty provision by which each shareholder effectively warrants that their shares can be transferred to Agrium free of any mortgage or the like over them. There is now nothing unusual in such a provision, provided that, as here, the deemed warranty provision is drawn to the attention of shareholders in the scheme booklet. [8] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] FCA 1089">On 13 September 2010, that is to say after the decision of the Panel but before the reasons were published, the RHD board announced that Peoplebank had formally agreed to increase its offer to 70 cents per RHD share. The effect of this was to reduce the break fee of $500,000 from approximately 1% of the consideration for the proposal, to a figure of 0.9%. That falls within the guideline which is discussed in Guidance Note 7 --- Lock-Up Devices which has been published by the Takeovers Panel. It is also consistent with the matters considered in relation to break fees by Lindgren J in Re APN News &amp; Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 (" Re APN News "). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] VSC 423">11 Lindgren J in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [3] explained how a deemed warranty achieves this effect: 
 
 
 the purpose of the deemed warranty is to prevent a shareholder whose shares are subject to encumbrances from receiving the same scheme consideration as that to be received by those whose shares are free from encumbrances, without any obligation, in effect, to refund to [the acquirer] the amount required to discharge the encumbrance...The amount of the damages payable for breach of the warranty is the amount required to discharge the encumbrance. [4] 
 
 
 In the circumstances and consistently with the preponderance of authority I do not regard the warranty clause as posing any issue in relation to the Court exercising its power to convene the meeting.  19 Santow J in Arthur Yates &amp; Co Limited [6] said that an exclusivity provision should be for no more than a reasonable period that is capable of precise ascertainment, must be subject to an overriding obligation not to breach director's fiduciary duties and should be given adequate prominence in the materials sent to members. The consistent approach of courts in later cases has been to require a fiduciary carve out only in relation to "no-talk" provisions. [7] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2010] VSC 367">This belief is reflected in cl 12.3 of the Scheme Implementation Agreement. 26 Break fees are also a commonplace feature in proposed arrangements. In Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [14] Lindgren J said: 
 
 
 Break fees are justified by reference to: 
 
 the costs incurred by the offeror company; the benefit that that company confers on the members of the target company by increasing its value; and the desirability from the viewpoint of those members that takeover offers be made to them. [15] 
However the authorities recognise that it may be appropriate for the Court to decline to order that a scheme meeting be convened, if the Court is satisfied that the break fee is so large as to be likely to coerce the shareholders into agreeing to the scheme, rather than assessing the offer on its merits. [16] 
 
 27 The evidence is that the amount of the break fee is a genuine estimate of the costs reasonably incurred by Asia Pacific Healthcare as a result of entering into the scheme arrangement. 19 Santow J in Re Arthur Yates &amp; Co Ltd [11] said that an exclusivity provision should be for no more than a reasonable period that is capable of precise ascertainment, must be subject to an overriding obligation not to breach directors' fiduciary duties and should be given adequate prominence in the materials sent to members. The consistent approach of Courts in later cases has been to require a fiduciary carve out only in relation to "no talk" provisions. [12] 
20 It is sufficient for present purposes to note that the exclusivity period is for five months which is within the period of restriction that the Courts have accepted as reasonable. [13] 
21 I also note that the "no talk" provisions are subject to an exception recognising the directors' statutory and fiduciary duties. 22 The "No shop" and "Notice of Competing Proposal" provisions are not subject to the same exception. 7 An order for convening a meeting for shareholders to vote on the scheme is the first step in the procedure for adoption and approval of the proposed scheme under s 411 of the Act. [1] 
 
 A. Function of the Court 
 
 8 The function of the Court on an application to convene a meeting for a proposed scheme of arrangement [2] is well established by authority. The Court exercises a supervisory jurisdiction. Essentially the Court is concerned with whether the procedural and substantive requirements for the calling and conduct of a meeting will be met. [8] In the circumstances, and consistently with the preponderance of authority, I do not regard the warranty clause as posing any issue in relation to the Court exercising its power to convene the meeting. 13 I am also satisfied that there is adequate disclosure of this provision in the explanatory booklet. [9] 
(ii) Exclusivity Provisions 
14 Healthscope has agreed to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit or accept alternative proposals for a certain period. Exclusivity provisions of the kind agreed to by Healthscope are a regular feature in Scheme Implementation Agreements. As Santow J observed in Re Arthur Yates &amp; Co Ltd [10] these constraints recognise the commercial reality that a prospective bidder under a scheme would not wish to spend substantial time and money on a bid proposal only to find that the directors of the target company are using that bid to solicit superior offers.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2010] FCA 517">A number of cases have considered that exclusivity provisions should satisfy the following concerns at the first stage of convening meetings: The period should be no more than a reasonable period capable of precise ascertainment. They should be framed so that they are subject to an overriding obligation not to breach the directors' fiduciary duties or otherwise be unlawful. There should be an adequate prominence given to the constraint in the explanatory statement.

<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] VSC 154">Each of these have been dealt with in the submissions filed in support of the application which I set out as follows: 
 
 Break fee 
 
(1) Clause 12 of the SIA contains certain provisions in relation to a reciprocal break fee of $16m, which may be paid by either Dyno Nobel or Incitec US Holdings depending on the circumstances (which are set out in section 1.10 of the draft Scheme Booklet). The circumstances in which the break fee was agreed upon are set out in clause 12.1 of the SIA, being that:
 
a. the Boards of Dyno Nobel and Incitec US Holdings agreed to the break fee having regard to the benefits accruing to Dyno Nobel and Incitec Pivot US Holdings, as well as to the shareholders of Dyno Nobel, Incitec US Holdings and Incitec Pivot; and
 
b. the amount payable is intended, to some extent, to compensate the other party for advisory costs, costs of management and directors' time, commitment fees, financing costs, out of pocket expenses, and opportunity costs incurred as part of the proposed transaction. (2) We submit that, in accordance with the guidelines set down in APN News &amp; Media Limited [6] :
 
a. the break fee was the result of ordinary commercial negotiation between Dyno Nobel and Incitec Pivot. See paragraph 25 of the Geoff Tomlinson Affidavit outlining the negotiation process undertaken;
 
b. the directors of Dyno Nobel unanimously recommend the proposed transaction (in the absence of a superior proposal) on the basis that it is in the best interests of Dyno Nobel shareholders. See section 1.4 of the draft Scheme Booklet; and
 
c. the break fee of $16m in comparison to Dyno Nobel's market capitalisation of approximately $2.3bn as implied by Incitec US Holdings' offer gives a percentage of 0.70%. 33 Mr Santamaria, one of Her Majesty's counsel, on behalf of counsel for Dyno Nobel, referred me to two cases where the court had approved a scheme where the consideration offered was said to be fair but fell between the low value and the high value of the target shares put on by the expert; those being Re APN News &amp; Media Limited [18] and Zenyth Therapeutics Limited v Smith.

 "Under cl 7.3(a) of the Implementation Agreement, each scheme participant is deemed to have warranted that all of its shares in Hostworks which are transferred under the scheme will be free from all mortgages and encumbrances. Fryberg J in Re Mincom Ltd (No 3) (2007) 25 ACLC 207 , regarded an almost identical deemed warranty clause as onerous and unreasonable and "calculated to catapult unsuspecting shareholders who have not read the small print of the arrangement in the schedule to the explanatory statement into a state of breach of warranty": at [21]. In Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400 , Lindgren J disagreed with the approach of Fryberg J: see at [59]---[62]. I respectfully agree with and adopt the views of Lindgren J. I share the understanding of his Honour that the purpose and effect of such a clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. 


14 In view of the preponderance of opinion reflected in several cases mentioned at the end of this passage and the detailed consideration given to the matter by Lindgren J in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 , I am satisfied that the inclusion of the warranty provision should not cause me to withhold the relief now sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2008] FCA 310">7 Clause 10 of the MID for the Nexus Scheme provides for payment of a break fee by each of Anzon Energy or Nexus in the amount of $2.5 million should certain events occur. Accordingly, the break fees are "reciprocal" or "mutual". The break fee payable by Anzon Energy is not a "naked no vote" break fee: cf Bolnisi Gold NL (No 2) [2007] FCA 2078. The amount of $2.5 million is less than the 1% "guidance ceiling" accepted by the Takeover Panel. There is evidence before the Court of a kind to which I referred in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [55] .
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2008] FCA 309">6 As noted in the earlier Reasons at [25]---[28], the Merger Implementation Deed (MID) for the ARC Scheme provided in cl 10 for a break fee of $4 million. Since the directors of Anzon Australia have withdrawn their support for the ARC Scheme in favour of the Nexus Scheme, that amount has been paid to ARC. The new MID between Anzon Australia and Nexus provides in cl 10 for a break fee in an identical amount. As under the earlier MID, there are reciprocal break fees and Anzon Australia's liability to pay the break fee is not triggered simply by the Shareholders voting down the Scheme (a "naked no vote" break fee): cf Re Bolnisi Gold NL (No 2) [2007] FCA 2078. The amount of the break fee represents 0.63% of the total equity value of Anzon Australia, which is well below the Takeover Panel' s 1% "guidance ceiling". The reasonableness and appropriateness of the break fee is supported by affidavit evidence of the kind to which I referred in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [55] .

<sentence id="cs28" from="[2008] FCA 64">41 Under cl 7.3(a) of the Implementation Agreement, each scheme participant is deemed to have warranted that all of its shares in Hostworks which are transferred under the scheme will be free from all mortgages and encumbrances. Fryberg J in Re Mincom Ltd (No 3) (2007) 25 ACLC 207 , regarded an almost identical deemed warranty clause as onerous and unreasonable and "calculated to catapult unsuspecting shareholders who have not read the small print of the arrangement in the schedule to the explanatory statement into a state of breach of warranty": at [21]. In Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400 , Lindgren J disagreed with the approach of Fryberg J: see at [59]-[62]. I respectfully agree with and adopt the views of Lindgren J. I share the understanding of his Honour that the purpose and effect of such a clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. The amount of the damages payable for breach of the warranty would be equal to the amount required to discharge the encumbrance. I note that the approach of Lindgren J has been preferred in subsequent cases, including by Robson J in Re Coles Group Limited [2007] VSC 389 at [45] ; by Lander J in Re Adelaide Bank Limited [2007] FCA 1582 at [33] ; and by Gyles J in Orion Telecommunications Ltd [2007] FCA 1389 at [9] . 26 Section 411 further requires that the Court is satisfied that the scheme can properly be described as a compromise or arrangement so as to come within its ambit. The word "arrangement" has been held to be a word of wide import, not limited by its relationship or the expression "compromise". An arrangement may extend to any subject matter which is something which a company is able to agree with its members, and is likened to a contract between a company and its members. As noted earlier, there have been a number of cases in which a scheme involving the acquisition of a company's issued capital for cash, so that the company becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of an acquiring entity, is a common use of the Pt 5.1 procedure. See also e.g. Re Mincom Ltd (No 3) (2007) 25 ACLC 207 ; and Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400.  Before that carve-out operates, the directors of Hostworks must be satisfied that the competing transaction is bona fide and in writing by a reputable entity, and they must have determined in good faith and acting reasonably (after independent advice) that the competing transaction is capable of being valued and completed, and is of a higher value to Hostworks and its shareholders than the proposed scheme. They must also have received written advice from Hostworks' external legal adviser that failing to respond to such a bona fide competing transaction would more likely than not constitute a breach of the independent directors' fiduciary duties or statutory obligations. In Re Arthur Yates and Co Ltd [2001] NSWSC 40 ; (2001) 36 ACSR 758 , Santow J expressed the view that no-talk provisions should satisfy certain particular concerns, at [9] which Lindgren J in Re APN News Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400 at [29] described in the following terms:
 
 
 (a) it should be for no more than a reasonable period capable of precise ascertainment; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) while it may differentiate between actively soliciting an alternative merger proposal and simply dealing with an unsolicited one, in either case the provision should be framed so that it is subject to the overriding obligation not to breach the directors' fiduciary duties or be otherwise unlawful; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) there should be adequate prominence given to the provision in the explanatory memorandum sent to shareholders.  32 The performance risk concern has been raised in previous scheme of arrangement applications. They are referred to by Lindgren J in Re APN News [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400 at [23] . I will not repeat them. It is necessary to consider the so called "performance risk" of shareholders being left in a position, once the scheme has become effective, of their shares having been transferred to Broadcast Australia, but then facing a delay in the provision of the scheme consideration, so that their only remedy would be to sue on the Deed Poll. That risk has been overcome here by requiring the scheme consideration to be paid to Hostworks before 12 noon on the "implementation date" to be held in trust by Hostworks for the purpose of being paid to the scheme participants, that is the shareholders of Hostworks, before they are divested of their shares in Hostworks later on in the implementation date. Broadcast Australia must provide the funds to pay for the shares it is to acquire before they are transferred. A similar arrangement was satisfactory to Robson J for the purposes of authorising or directing the calling of the proposed meeting in Re Coles Group [2007] VSC 389 ; see at [38]. The Deed Poll contains a covenant on the part of Broadcast Australia to provide the scheme consideration on the implementation date in accordance with the terms of the scheme so that it ties the settlement step of payment and transfer together. 38 Clause 11 of the Implementation Agreement imposes a break fee provision. Break fees are also now a commonplace feature in proposed agreements for schemes of arrangements and in merger and takeover agreements, both in Australia and overseas. See per Lindgren J in APN News Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400 at [43] . As his Honour said at [44], break fees are justified by reference to the costs incurred by the offeror company; the benefit that that company confers on the members of the target company by increasing its value; and the desirability, from the viewpoint of those members, that takeover offers be made to them. His Honour then went on to consider contemporary practice in relation to break fees. There is a more lengthy discussion by his Honour of general considerations relating to break fees in Bolnisi Gold NL in the matter of Bolnisi Gold NL (No 2) [2007] FCA 2078 at [9] - [30]. It is a most helpful discussion. 31 In Re APN News Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400 , Lindgren J discussed at some length aspects of the proposed scheme then under consideration which may be described as performance risk; "no-shop" and "no-talk" restrictions; break fee; and a deemed warranty by the members of the target company. Each of those features is present in the proposed scheme. It is appropriate to consider them each in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2007] FCA 2080">24 In my view, the presence of the exclusivity and break fee provisions in the MID should not stand in the way of the Anzon Energy Shareholders having the opportunity to consider the Anzon Energy Scheme: see Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [25] - [55] ; Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1186 at [31] - [35] ; Re Bolnisi Gold NL [2007] FCA 1668 at [25] - [26].

<sentence id="cs31" from="[2007] FCA 2078">9 I discussed break fees and other "deal protection" measures, notably "no shop" or exclusivity period provisions, in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 ( APN ) at [25]---[55] and to a lesser extent in Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1186 at [31] ---[35], and will not repeat what I said in those cases. Generally, a break fee is a fee payable by the target company to the acquiring company in certain circumstances in which the acquisition is not implemented. Such provisions form part of a merger implementation agreement to which the directors of the target company commit their company prior to a scheme of arrangement being considered by the target company's shareholders. When deciding whether to order that a meeting be convened or that a scheme be approved, the Court is not in a position to decide whether a merger implementation agreement was entered into in breach of the duties owed by the target company's directors. The Court could do so only on a contested hearing in which it is alleged, and sought to be proved, that by committing the target company to the merger implementation agreement, the directors breached their statutory and general law duties: see eg, Idameneo (No 123) Pty Ltd v Symbion Health Limited [2007] FCA 1832.  16 The United Kingdom, like Australia, has legislative provision for judicial approval of schemes of arrangement: Companies Act 2006 (UK) c 46, Pt 26 (ss 895---901). There, as here, there is also a specialist takeover panel (the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers) and an associated administrative document containing guidance as to an acceptable level of break fee in the context of takeovers: The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (8 th ed, Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, 2006) and the Panel's Practice Statement No 4, r 21.2 regarding inducement fees, the effect of which I summarised in APN [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400 at [46] .</sentence>

Senior counsel also referred to the Takeovers Panel's recognition of this fact in its Guidance Note 7: Lock-up Devices . The Symbion Health Break Fee of $19.575 million can be expected to be of the order of 0.74 percent to 0.78 percent of the total equity value of what is being sold --- below the "ceiling" of one percent of the total equity value of a target company suggested by the Takeovers Panel.</sentence>

In the present case, Norman Alfred Seckold, the Chairman and a Director of Bolnisi, states as follows in his affidavit of 25 October 2007:

The attention of Bolnisi shareholders is drawn to the deemed warranty in the Scheme Booklet.

<sentence id="cs34" from="[2007] FCA 1619">26 Importantly, Sunsuper has no relevant interest in shares in CFI (in contrast to the position that prevailed in APN [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400). Accordingly, there is no scope for an argument that Sunsuper used its position as a CFI shareholder with "representation" on CFI's Board of Directors, somehow to lock the CFI shareholders into the Scheme. 32 In the circumstances I think that although affidavit evidence to the effect described by me in APN [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400 was not led (I remain of the view that affidavit evidence is desirable), I am entitled to infer, as I do, by reason of the terms of the MIA and the other circumstances referred to above, that the matters to which I referred in that case (at [55]) are established.
  22 I discussed provisions of this kind in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 ( APN ) at [25]-[55], and indicated (at [55]) that it seemed to be desirable that applications under s 411(1) be supported by affidavit evidence directed to showing certain matters. 27 I turn now to the break fee for which cl 12 of the MIA provides. The amount of that fee is $1 million. As noted in APN [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400 at [48] , the Takeovers Panel's Guidance Note 7, Lock-up Devices (2 nd issue, 2005) states (at [7.18]) that the Panel uses a guideline that a break fee should not exceed 1% of the "equity value" of the target, and for this purpose the equity value is the aggregate of the value of all classes of equity securities issued by the target. It will be recalled (see [8] above) that in the present case, the "equity value" of CFI is stated by Deloitte to lie between $104.8 million and $111 million. I note also that the aggregate consideration is $108,187,617.88 (135,573,456 shares x $0.798 per share). The break fee of $1 million dollars is below the 1% level. </sentence>

33 All three matters raised by Mr Bathurst QC were addressed by Lindgren J in this Court in Re APN News and Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400. In all three instances, his Honour found that similar clauses in similar transactions were no bar to the implementation of the proposed transactions. I respectfully agree with his Honour's reasons. 32 Lastly, he brought to my attention the provision in the agreement which deems the ordinary shareholder to have warranted to Bendigo Bank that their ordinary shares are fully paid and free from encumbrances. The purpose of the clause was adverted to by Lindgren J in Re APN News &amp; Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [59] - [60] :
 
 59 In substance, the purpose of the deemed warranty is to prevent a shareholder whose shares are subject to encumbrances from receiving the same scheme consideration as that to be received by those whose shares are free from encumbrances, without any obligation, in effect, to refund to INMAL the amount required to discharge the encumbrance. It is not practicable for amounts secured by encumbrance to be deducted from the scheme consideration payable to the relevant scheme participants on the implementation date. 60 The warranty will be deemed to have been given, not only by those offeree shareholders who vote to agree to the scheme, and who, therefore, can be seen to be consenting to give it, but also those who do not vote at all or who vote against the scheme. However, I do not think that this matters. What is important, in my view, is that the deemed warranty is no more than a device directed to ensuring that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. The amount of the damages payable for breach of the warranty is the amount required to discharge the encumbrance.</sentence>

 that the no-shop and break-fee provisions are the result of a normal commercial negotiation, and explaining, at least briefly and in general terms, the factual basis for that statement (see para [46] above]; that the directors of the target company, or at least those directors of it who are not affiliated with the offeror, believe that the provisions do not operate against the interests of offeree shareholders, and that in fact it was in the interests of such shareholders that the directors agreed to the inclusion of the provisions in the merger implementation agreement (see [46] above and Re Paramount communications Inc Shareholders' Litigation 637 A2d 34 (Del Supr 1993) for a case in which a target company's directors' commitment to no-shop and break-fee provisions was held, in all the circumstances, to constitute a breach of their fiduciary duty) ; and in the case of the break-fee, explaining by reference to calculations based on the evidence before the court, the percentage the break-fee represents (a) of the "equity value" of the target company calculated in accordance with paragraph 17.18 of the Takeover Panel's guidance note 7, and (b) of the scheme consideration (the explanation might, instead, be conveyed in a submission, but still by reference to the evidence before the court). " [16]  40 In Re APN News &amp; Media [15] , Lindgren J held in respect of a break-fee and no-shop provision that: 
 
"It would be desirable that applications under s 411(1) be supported by affidavit evidence directed to showing:

" [16]  41 Lindgren J went onto say that if the independent expert is in a position to express an opinion on the matter, the expert should state whether the no-shop and break-fee provisions appear to be reasonable and not detrimental to the interests of shareholders, and if so, the basis for that opinion. [17] 
Deemed Warranty  39 Lindgren J referred with approval [12] to Re Arthur Yates &amp; Co Ltd [13] , where Santow J expressed the opinion that a no-shop provision should satisfy the following concerns: 
 
"(a) it should be for no more than a reasonable period capable of precise ascertainment;
 
 (b) while it may differentiate between actively soliciting an alternative merger proposal and simply dealing with an unsolicited one, in either case the provision should be framed so that it is subject to the overriding obligation not to breach the directors' fiduciary duties or be otherwise unlawful;
 
 (c) there should be adequate prominence given to the provision in the explanatory memorandum sent to shareholders. " [14] 
 
 "Break-Fee"  43 Mr Bathurst submitted that Fryberg J's approach is at odds with the approach taken to deemed warranties by the Federal Court. In Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [20] , Lindgren J disagreed with the approach in Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd [21] and made the following observations regarding the operation of deemed warranties: 
 
"In substance, the purpose of the deemed warranty is to prevent a shareholder whose shares are subject to encumbrances from receiving the same scheme consideration as that to be received by those whose shares are free from encumbrances, without any obligation, in effect, to refund to [the bidder] the amount required to discharge the encumbrance. It is not practicable for amounts secured by encumbrance to be deducted from the scheme consideration payable to the relevant scheme participants on the scheme implementation date. The warranty will be deemed to be given, not only by those offeree shareholders who vote to agree to the scheme, and who, therefore, can be seen to be consenting to give it, but also those who do not vote at all or who vote against the scheme. 61 Mr Bathurst submitted that, as referred to above, in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [25] , Lindgren J referred with approval to the decision of Santow J in Re Arthur Yates &amp; Co Ltd [26] , and said that such "no shop" "no talk" provisions should satisfy the three matters I quoted above.  66 Mr Bathurst submitted similar observations were made by Lindgren J in Re APN News &amp; Media Limited [29] . In that case, Lindgren J observed [30] that such fees are common and have not been an obstacle to the making of orders under subsection 411(1) of the Act. His Honour held that the issue is whether "the liability to pay the break fee would be likely to coerce offeree shareholders into agreeing to the scheme, or to deter companies from making a competing offer. " [31]  37 In Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [11] , Lindgren J looked at several relevant factors in considering whether to order meetings in addition to the express statutory requirements and in particular matters under the heading of "Performance Risk", "No-Shop Restriction", "Break-Fee" and "Deemed Warranty". Performance Risk </sentence>
<sentence id="cs38" from="[2007] FCA 1570">6 There was some discussion of the provision of the implementation agreement under which HPAL has agreed to pay a "break fee" not exceeding $3 million if the scheme does not proceed. The break fee is less than one per cent calculated on the transaction value. This topic was addressed by Lindgren J in APN News &amp; Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 , in particular at [43], [46]-[49] and [55]. Although there is no affidavit evidence along the lines of that referred to by Lindgren J at [55], I would infer that there had been arm's length negotiations between the parties because each of the parties is independently represented by experienced firms of solicitors. </sentence>

9 In purporting to create a contractual obligation by the former member in favour of a third party --- whether the member voted for or against the scheme or did not vote --- that clause appears to stretch the effect of an arrangement between a company and its members a long way. However, Lindgren J considered such a clause in Re APN News 62 ACSR 400 ; 25 ACLC 784 ; [2007] FCA 770 at [57] ---[63] with approval and took the same course in Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 at [21] . In Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] QSC 207 Fryberg J considered such a clause at [20]---[29]. His Honour was persuaded to change the initial adverse reaction which he had expressed in Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd (2007) 61 ACSR 266 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 163 ; [2007] QSC 37 at [39] . In this field, it is acknowledged that uniformity of decision is important to avoid unnecessary uncertainty. As I cannot be satisfied that the other decisions are clearly wrong, I should follow them. If, on confirmation of the scheme, a party raises the issue so that an argument with a contradictor takes place, it is possible that a different result would occur. Even if that were so, the scheme could be confirmed without the relevant clause (cf Re WebCentral Group Ltd (No 2) (2006) 58 ACSR 742 ; [2006] FCA 1203).  7 My attention has been drawn to several aspects of the scheme which have, in the past, caused debate. I am satisfied that there is no relevant performance risk for shareholders. The break fee, no shop and no talk obligations are within reasonable bounds and in accordance with authority ( Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd (2007) 62 ACSR 400 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 784 ; [2007] FCA 770 at [25] ---[55]). There is no complication in relation to the scheme itself by reason of the existence of the options which are to be dealt with by another mechanism. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs40" from="[2007] FCA 1104">31 The Implementation Agreement contains "no shop" and break fee provisions. I discussed such provisions in APN [2007] FCA 770 ; 25 ACLC 784 at [25] ---[35] and [36]---[55] respectively.  21 Each Scheme Participant is deemed to have warranted that all of its Shares and Units to be transferred to Morgan Stanley Bidco will at the date of transfer be "fully paid and free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise, and restrictions on transfer of any kind...", and that the Scheme Participant has full power and capacity to sell and transfer them: cl 7.3. I have no difficulty with a provision of that kind: see APN News &amp; Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 784 ( APN ) at [57]---[63].
