<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 1389">96 If Mr Ashhurst is correct, then it must follow that Star City has no power to refuse entry even on a one-off basis (say, for drunkenness or inappropriate attire) other than by invoking the exclusion mechanism in s 79. Such a result surely could not have been intended (and would appear to be inconsistent with the objective of the legislation being to control the potential of a casino to cause harm to the public interest). In that regard, I note that, in reviewing the operation of the part of the Act dealing with Exclusion Orders, Jacobson J in Foroughi v Star City Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1503 (at [70]) recognised that one of the primary objects of the Act is to contain and control the potential of a casino to cause harm to the public interest and to individuals and families (there referring in particular to s 4A(1)(c)) (in the context of a case in which his Honour found there was no breaches of a duty of care nor other statutory duties on the part of Star City by reason of its failure to detect and prohibit the attendance of a person at the casino after the making of a voluntary exclusion order under s 79(3)). An unwieldy process for refusing on-the-spot admission to the casino (rather than leaving this in the casino operator's discretion) seems inconsistent with such an objective. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] VSC 526">53 On 27 September 2007, after argument had been heard in this case, Jacobson J in the Federal Court delivered judgment in Foroughi v Star City Pty Ltd. [70] Mr Foroughi was a patron of the Star City Casino in Sydney as well as the Crown Casino in Melbourne. After a two-day splurge in which he left much money behind at both, he asked that Star City make a voluntary exclusion order forbidding him to return. His request was met. Several weeks later, he decided to test the casino's ability to detect his presence. He was "very surprised" that he re-entered unimpeded, and remained inside undetected. So "he went back many times, gambling very large amounts of money. " [71] He continued to gamble, undetected, even after issuing proceedings in which he asserted that Star City owed him a duty of care "the content of which is not entirely clear, but which appears to have been to take reasonable steps to prevent him from entering the gaming areas of the casino and/or to remove him from the casino.
