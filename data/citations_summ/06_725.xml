<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] WADC 69">18 The defendant contends that cl 11 of the deed is contrary to public policy in that it amounts to an attempt to oust the jurisdiction of the Court by seeking to prohibit the defendant from exercising its right to resist an application for summary judgment in a sum certified by the plaintiff's authorised representative. It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that, whilst a provision in a deed which purports to oust the jurisdiction of the Court may be contrary to public policy, the provision in question does not purport to do so --- rather, it is an acknowledgement that the defendant will not oppose matters set out in the deed if they are put forward in an application for summary judgment. Counsel submitted: "That goes to the evidentiary foundation for the application, not an ouster of the jurisdiction itself". I note that in Gap (ITM) Inc v Temporary Department Store Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 725 , the deed of settlement provided that if the respondents defaulted in making payments they would consent to summary judgment. Kenny J held, in relation to the plaintiff's application for summary judgment, that there was no arguable defence on the facts, and the provision in the deed was not held to be void as contrary to public policy. I further note that cl 18 of the deed executed by the parties to the present application expressly provides that: 
 
 "If any part of this Deed is or becomes void or unenforceable, that part shall be severed from this Deed to the intent that all parts that are not or have not become void or unenforceable remain in full force and effect and unaffected by any severance. " </sentence>
