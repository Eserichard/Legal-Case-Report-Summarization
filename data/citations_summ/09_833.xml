<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 1398">28 In response senior counsel for Ms Dodds and the lead plaintiff submits that Bligh v Tredgett was decided at a time when courts did not have the same wide discretion as to costs as they have now. He referred to the Abualfoul decision and to that of Fernando (by his tutor, John Ley) v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 9) [2009] FCA 833; (Siopis J) as demonstrating a greater flexibility in the approach by the courts to the payment of costs by tutors. He submits that Ms Dodds should only be responsible for those costs incurred after her appointment as tutor.</sentence>
