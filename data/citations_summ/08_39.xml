<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VSC 425">) Rather, it seems to me that in the critical sentence the Full Court meant to convey only that a person did not himself or herself become a supplier of services merely because he or she had come under an obligation to pay money for some service supplied or to be supplied to him or her. Reading the critical sentence together with what the Full Court had said immediately before, and having regard to the judgment as a whole, I consider that the Full Court was intending to convey, overall, that a simple payment of money as quid pro quo for goods or services supplied is not itself a service. That appears to be the way in which Queensland Aggregates was understood in Yang v American International Assurance Company (Australia) Ltd, [69] being, as far as I am aware, the only case in which the proposition that a simple payment of money does not itself comprise a supply of services under the TPA has actually been applied. In Yang, the subject matter was remuneration for the provision of insurance agency services on contract. With respect, I think that this is a completely logical and understandable way in which to read the legislation.</sentence>

"Conduct" is not co-extensive with "representation" in s 52 (Lockhart and Gummow JJ in Accounting Systems 2000 (Developments) Pty Ltd v CCH Australia Ltd (1993) 42 FCR 470 at 504, Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ at 603, McHugh J at 622) however engaging in conduct does encompass making representations (cf McGrath; in the matter of Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd (in liq) v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 2 at [150] ). 2. Where a party alleges that the conduct of another was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, it is ordinarily necessary for that party to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the court the nature of the alleged conduct and the circumstances which rendered the conduct misleading: McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318 (cf for example, Lahoud v Lahoud [2006] NSWCA 169 at [91] , Yang v American International Assurance Co (Australia) Ltd [2008] FCA 39 at [89] ). 3. Where the conduct is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation, it is necessary that the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the court to be reasonably satisfied that they were in fact misleading in the proved circumstances: Watson 49 NSWLR 315 at 318 (cf for example Christofidellis v Zdrilic [1999] FCA 39 , Ingot Capital Investments Pty Ltd v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets Ltd (No 6) (2007) 63 ACLR 1 at 107, Yang FCA 39 at [89]).</sentence>

Subsequently, on 16 April 2008, his Honour ordered that the costs which the appellants were ordered on 12 March 2008 to pay to AIA be paid on a party-party basis up to 11 September 2007 and from that date on an indemnity basis: see Yang v American International Assurance Company (Australia) Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 493. </sentence>
