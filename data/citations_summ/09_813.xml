<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] QSC 108">[13] However, the focus must be upon the differences, if any, between different groups of shareholders or option holders, by reason of any differences in their respective legal rights as such. In UDL Argos Engineering &amp; Heavy Industries Co Ltd v Li Oi Lin, [1] Lord Millett said that the test is whether the legal rights of persons are sufficiently similar or dissimilar, and not whether there is a sufficient similarity or dissimilarity of interests not derived from such legal rights and that "[t]he fact that individuals may hold divergent views based on their private interests not derived from their legal rights against the company is not a ground for calling separate meetings". [2] Australian Courts have applied the same principle: see eg Re NRMA Insurance Ltd (No 1); [3] Re HIH Casualty and General Insurance Limited [4] and Re Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd. [5] 
[14] In the proposed scheme for shareholders, there are different provisions according to whether, at the relevant date, [6] a shareholder is what is described as an Eligible (CDI) Scheme Member, which is defined to mean a shareholder who is then recorded on the Australian register of the company's shareholders. On the implementation date those shareholders would receive CDIs, the shares being held by the nominee. Other shareholders participating in the scheme would be issued with shares in the UK company.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] VSC 93">15 That test has been adopted ever since in members' schemes. In more recent times, the courts have observed that the test laid down is not one of identical treatment but rather one of community of interest. [5] As Santow J has noted, "divergent commercial interests extrinsic to share membership are ordinarily not a factor which should differentiate classes. " [6] The courts are also mindful that if there is more than one class, each will have a power of veto. [7] As Lush J stated in Re International Harvester this: 
... undermines the basic approach of decision by a large majority, and ... should only be permitted if there are dissimilar interests related to the company and its scheme to be protected. The fact that two views may be expressed at a meeting because one group prefers one course ... while another group prefers another, is not a reason for calling two separate meetings. [8] 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] VSC 4">11 The matters referred to in paragraph (a) of the preceding paragraph require the Court to look forward to the exercise of the Court's discretion at the stage of the s 411 procedure when the Court is asked to approve the scheme. Thus, Davies J said in Re Cytopia Ltd: [5] 
 
 
 "The approach that the Court should adopt when considering this application is to review the scheme and the Scheme Booklet to ascertain whether the scheme complies with the requirements under the Act and to consider whether there is any presently discernible reason as to why the proposed scheme of arrangement should not be put to the meeting of the members to vote on. Ordinarily, the Court will not order the convening of a meeting 'unless the scheme is of such a nature and cast in such terms that, if it achieves the statutory majority at the ... meeting the court would be likely to approve it on the hearing of a petition which is unopposed'. [6] Thus, as Finkelstein J observed in Re Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd : [7] 
 
 
 
 
 [I]t is necessary for a court to be alive to any difficulties that may arise if in due course it may be asked to approve the scheme. [8] 
 
 
 
 
 The authorities make it clear that the Court's role at this stage is not to express a view on whether the proposed scheme should be approved. [9] It is also clear that it is not the Court's role to usurp the shareholders' decision, by attempting to intrude its own commercial judgment. [10] The Court is to be concerned with whether there is adequate disclosure to the shareholders in the Scheme Booklet (or explanatory memorandum), whether the legal requirements otherwise have been complied with and whether the scheme, on its face, is one that is sufficiently 'fair and reasonable' to be capable of being put to shareholders for their approval or rejection. [11] " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] NSWSC 1316">
 

20 The current Australian practice is the same: see, for example, the express approval of it by Finkelstein J in Re Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd [2009] FCA 813 ; (2009) 179 FCR 20 (at [16]ff) and the recent authoritative statement in Re CSR Ltd [2010] FCAFC 34 ; (2010) 183 FCR 358. But any view reached on the matter of classes upon the hearing of the s 411(1) application will necessarily be provisional. It will not prevent full debate on the issue if and when it is raised at any s 411(4)(b) hearing. An issue of possible class differentiation may emerge for the first time at that point: see, for example, Re HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd [2006] NSWSC 485 ; (2006) 200 FLR 243. Members generally have not had any earlier opportunity to be heard and to put arguments to the court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] VSC 423">37 The test for whether the option deed causes a separate class is not one of identical treatment but of community of interest. The relevant question is whether the rights of particular persons are so dissimilar that they cannot sensibly consult together with a view to their common interest but must be given separate meetings. Persons whose rights are sufficiently similar that they can consult together with a view to their common interest should be summoned to a single meeting. [18] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCAFC 34">60 The courts have not previously considered it necessary, at the application stage, under s 411(1) of the Act or its analogues, to examine in any great detail a proposed compromise or arrangement. As was noted by Finkelstein J in In the matter of Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited [2009] FCA 813 ( Opes Prime ) at [17]:. For example, in England the practice note reported in [1934] WN 142 affirmed that it was for the company to decide whether creditors should be divided into classes for voting purposes, taking the risk that the correct decision was made, which would only be discovered at the approval hearing. In UDL Argos Engineering &amp; Heavy Industries Co Ltd v Li Oi Lin [2001] HKCFA 54 ; [2001] 3 HKLRD 634 Lord Millett, sitting as a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong, said this practice was a sound one. It has been applied to other issues relating to jurisdiction. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] VSC 560">[1] Thus, as Finkelstein J observed in Re Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd: [2] 
 
 
 [I]t is necessary for a court to be alive to any difficulties that may arise if in due course it may be asked to approve the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 1277">In In the matter of Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited [2009] FCA 813 ; (2009) 73 ACSR 385 , Finkelstein J said (at [66]): 
 
 The application of the relevant test involves a comparison of the rights creditors have in the absence of the scheme and any new rights that are established under the scheme: Re T &amp; N Ltd (No 3) [2007] 1 All ER at 882. Once those differences are identified the question whether they form separate classes must be assessed with the following factors in mind. First, when creditors are broken up into classes, each class is given power to veto the scheme and that is a process that undermines the basic approach of decision by majority: Nordic Bank Plc v International Harvester Australia Ltd [1983] VicRp 89 ; [1983] 2 VR 298 , 301.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] HCATrans 295">HIS HONOUR: At first instance it is [2009] FCA 813 ; 258 ALR 362.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCAFC 130">107 All parties referred to the recent decision by Finklestein J in In the matter of Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd (recs and mgrs apptd) (in liq) [2009] FCA 813 ; (2009) 258 ALR 362. He held that s 411 permitted the Court to approve an arrangement under s 411 that required unsecured creditors of the company to release their claims against outsiders by authorising the scheme administrators to execute releases on the creditors' behalf. No Australian authority supported his Honour's reasoning. It is inapposite to Pt 5.3A for the reasons above. In Opes 258 ALR at 373 [36]-[38] Finkelstein J did not follow the decision in Re Buildmat (Australia) Pty Ltd and the Companies Act (1981) 5 ACLR 689 at 692, where Needham J held that the discharge of a debt under a scheme of arrangement did not release the liability to the creditor of a surety for that debt. That is the very result confirmed by s 444J in respect of deeds of company arrangement.  111 Thus, it is not necessary to decide whether Finkelstein J in Opes [2009] FCA 813 ; 258 ALR 362 or the Full Court on appeal in Fowler [2009] FCAFC 125 correctly construed s 411, but these reasons should not be seen as endorsing the reasoning in either decision. However, the Full Court did not refer to the basic principles of statutory construction that require interpretation of legislative provisions in such a way as will not affect individuals' property rights without the clearest words: American Dairy Queen 147 CLR at 682-683; Bropho 171 CLR at 18; Blue Metal Industries 117 CLR at 659. Nor did they examine the ratio of McLelland J's reasoning in Re Glendale [1982] 2 NSWLR 563 , that the Court order authorised by s 411 of the Act (or its predecessors) does not give any validity to so much of a scheme as affects rights or liabilities as between an outsider and creditors of a company. 142 It is true that two recent decisions of this Court --- Re Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd [2009] FCA 813 ; (2009) 258 ALR 362 and the appeal from that decision, Re Fowler v Lindholm; Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd [2009] FCAFC 125 --- have concluded that a third party release may be approved as part of a scheme of arrangement under Part 5.1. Since the question for present purposes is whether that proposition was established in 1992, there is no need for me to express a view about the correctness of those decisions, save to the extent that they impact on my interpretation of the five cases to which I have referred. </sentence>
