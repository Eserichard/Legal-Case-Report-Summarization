<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 23">Rule 14AA is intended to regulate comprehensively the Court's practice with respect to the intervention of non parties (see Sharman Networks Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 178 ; (2006) 155 FCR 291 at [11] ). Where the parties to an appeal are represented by substantial and competent teams of lawyers and an applicant for leave to intervene proposes to raise matters already ventilated by the parties to the appeal, the application for leave to intervene would normally be refused (see ASIC v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Limited (No.3) [2007] FCA 393 at [12] - [13] and Levy v State of Victoria [1997] HCA 31 ; (1997) 189 CLR 579 at 604).

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1391">In Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd (No. 3) [2007] FCA 393 , Jacobson J found that he was not satisfied that the contribution of a group which he described as a ' lobby group ', namely the Australian Financial Markets Association ('AFMA'), would contribute to the proceedings in a way which was ' useful or different from the contributions of the parties ' (see [12]). His Honour observed that the parties were well represented by substantial teams of legal counsel. He also observed at [13] that the applicant in those proceedings, ASIC, would not ' be influenced by tactical or forensic considerations which would be necessary to be off-set by submissions made by AFMA '. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 175">36 In the trial in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Limited (ACN 003 114 832) (No 3) [2007] FCA 393 Jacobson J declined to make orders giving leave to the Australian Financial Markets Association to intervene in the trial. He observed that the Association was an industry association for participants in the financial markets industry which could be described as a 'lobby group for the industry'. He observed that its role was to 'represent the interests of its members and advocate what it described in its evidence as a "sensible and proportionate regulation of the wholesale banking and financial markets'''. The plaintiff, Australian Securities and Investments Commission, opposed the intervention, arguing that it was inappropriate for what was in essence a lobby group for the industry to intervene. It argued that whilst the Association had a substantial interest in the outcome, that was not a proper basis for permitting them to intervene. </sentence>
