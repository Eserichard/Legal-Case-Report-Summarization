<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 530">Courts exercising the current jurisdiction have identified numerous factors that may be relevant in assessing the appropriate penalty: see, for example, Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 at 228-229 [120] - [123]; Comcare v Commonwealth [2009] FCA 700 ; (2009) 184 IR 441 at 461 [71] ; Comcare v John Holland Rail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 771 ; [2009] FCA 771 ; (2009) 188 IR 415 at 428-429 [136] - [142]; Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 ; (2007) 98 ALD 67 at 68-69 [5] - [7]; and Linfox at 168 [40]. Compare too DPP v Amcor Packaging Australia Pty Ltd [2005] VSCA 219 ; (2005) 11 VR 557 at 565 [35] . To quote Flick J in Post Logistics at 585-8 [32]-[39]: 
 
 [32] In the statutory context of the present legislation, Madgwick J has focussed attention upon those considerations relevant to the imposition of a penalty in Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1331">There are no statutory entitlements to "credit" or "discount" on penalty where a respondent acknowledges fault and indeed co-operates with the applicant through the proceeding. However, as a matter of public policy, such actions will commonly entitle a respondent to additional consideration when penalty is assessed: Barker J in Comcare v John Holland Rail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 771 at [143] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1220">Ultimately Madgwick J expressed the view, at [121], that the overriding principle is that the pecuniary penalty should reflect the Court's view of the seriousness of the offending conduct; see also Coochey v Commonwealth of Australia [2005] FCA 1165 ; (2005) 149 FCR 312 at [73] . A similar approach was taken by North J in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 700 ; (2009) 184 IR 441 ; 110 ALD 252 and Barker J in Comcare v John Holland Rail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 771 ; (2009) 188 IR 415 at [137] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 793">Similarly in Comcare v John Holland Rail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 771 ; [2009] FCA 771 ; (2009) 188 IR 415 , Barker J said (at [135]-[136]) speaking of the OHS Act: 
 
 [135] Object (g) anticipates that where obligations are not met, effective remedies may be imposed through both the use of civil remedies and, in serious cases, criminal sanctions. To put the matter directly, the inclusion of Sch 2 in the OHS Act emphasises a legislative intention that contravention of the occupational, health and safety principles and duties created by the Act should be sanctioned, in appropriate cases, by civil or criminal orders. 
 

 
 
 [136] In the present case, the purpose of a civil pecuniary penalty, if imposed, is to deter the particular offender from offending again, as well as having the effect of generally deterring other employers from acting in a similar way. The imposition of a pecuniary penalty may be considered to have the advantage of reminding a particular employer of the importance of complying with the duties imposed on them by the OHS Act, as well as reminding other employers of the potential consequences should they fail to comply with the requirements of the Act. The imposition of an appropriate penalty is also calculated to give the community, and in particular relevant employees, confidence that the OHS Act is taken seriously. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1515">In the absence of mitigating circumstances, I consider that the appropriate penalty in this case would be $200,000. This is reflective of the fact that the objective seriousness of the respondent's conduct is at the higher end of the scale but does not exhibit characteristics of the worst kind of conduct. However I agree with, and adopt, observations of Barker J in Comcare v John Holland Rail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 771 at [143] where his Honour observed: 
 
 Where, for example, a respondent in a proceeding such as these early on acknowledges fault and willingness to accept a declaration of contravention, then the respondent will ordinarily be entitled to additional consideration in the assessment of the penalty. In some contexts this process is termed giving credit or "discount" on penalty. There is no statutory entitlements to such credit or a discount but it serves public policy in that it encourages a respondent to act responsibly, and may achieve a reduction in the public resources that would otherwise be required to prosecute the proceedings against the respondent. (at [143])
