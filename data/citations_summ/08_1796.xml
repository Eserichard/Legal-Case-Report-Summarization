<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 36">This translates to a practical as well as principled restraint. It is important at the outset to also recall that the Court will not be concerned with looseness in the language of the Tribunal nor with unhappy phrasing of the Tribunal's thoughts. The Tribunal's reasons in this appeal must be read sensibly, not seeking to perceive error, but concentrating on the task of the Court which is to interfere only when the identified error is one of law (see for example the approach of the Full Court and Hely J in Tax Agents' Board v Bray (2004) 58 ATR 118 at [22]; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 and Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria (No 2) [2008] FCA 1796 at [10] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 356">On 27 November 2008, the Court allowed the appeal and remitted the matter to the Tribunal: see Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria (No 2) [2008] FCA 1796 ('the second appeal'). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] AATA 140">The decision in Toohey was appealed to the Federal Court before Middleton J (reported as Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria (No 2) [2008] FCA 1796). The appeal was ultimately upheld and, in remitting the matter back to the Tribunal for determination, Middleton J said (at paragraph 16): 
 
 "16. ... In determining whether a person is a fit and proper person the enquiry is directed not only to whether improper conduct has occurred, but whether it is likely to occur again, and whether the community will have confidence that it will not occur ... The Tribunal should have considered and, more importantly, evaluated all the material which was raised as to 'special circumstances' in the context of a separate and ultimate enquiry of whether the appellant, at the time of the Tribunal's decision, was the prescribed fit and proper person. " [Emphasis added] 
 

 
Having regard to Mr Mortimer's comments in his outline of argument that he had a general inclination to not obey authority, the Tribunal is concerned that his improper conduct is likely to occur again and it may be that the community will not have confidence that it will not occur. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 948">The Tribunal does not doubt that Mr Kellett suffered a serous physical illness and experienced some unexplained pain following the surgery. He is receiving treatment for a depressive illness that was diagnosed in 2009, and in the context of the overall situation the Tribunal takes into account that he appears to have made good progress in the four to six weeks before the hearing ( Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria (No. 2) [2008] FCA 1796). However, on the available material, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the circumstances described by Mr Kellett are sufficiently unusual or out of the ordinary to constitute special circumstances, so his actions or omissions should not be disregarded under s 251BC(3) of the Act. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] AATA 766">In Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria (No 2) [2008] FCA 1796 , at [16], Middleton J, also noted: 
 
 In determining whether a person is a fit and proper person the enquiry is directed not only to whether improper conduct has occurred, but whether it is likely to occur again, and whether the community will have confidence that it will not occur. This will involve an evaluation of character and reputation: see Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 , 380 per Toohey and Gaudron JJ. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] AATA 603"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] AATA 142">2. On appeal, ( Toohey v Tax Agents' Board of Victoria (No 2) [2] ), Middleton J found no error of law in the way in which I had approached the first issue relating to special circumstances. He did find such an error in relation to the way in which I had approached the second. The relevant passage from his judgment is this:
 
" ... There was a reference to the lodgement rate ('at least in the 2002 year (at [156] of the Tribunal's decision)), correspondence on 7 July 2004 (at [159]), and conduct in 2003 (at [159]). No attempt was made to put these events in context, nor to consider them in the context of later events and circumstances. " [3] </sentence>
