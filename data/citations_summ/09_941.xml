<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1056">As summarised by McKerracher J in Champion v State of Western Australia [2009] FCA 941 at [2] - [3]: 
 
 [2] Section 190F(6) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the NTA), introduced in the amendments made to the NTA in July 2007, confers upon the Court a discretionary power to dismiss an application, either on the application of a party or on its own motion, if:
 (a) the Court is satisfied that the application has not been amended since consideration by the Native Title Registrar (the Registrar) and is not likely to be amended in a way that would lead to a different outcome once considered by the Registrar, and
 (b) in the opinion of the Court, there is no other reason why the application in issue should not be dismissed. 
 

 
 
 [3] Pursuant to s 190F(5) , the new dismissal power applies where:
 (a) the Registrar does not accept the claim for registration because: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) it does not satisfy all the merit conditions of the registration test; or
 (ii) it was so procedurally defective as to render it impossible to determine whether the claim satisfies the merit conditions; and 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the Court is satisfied that the avenues for reconsideration and review have been exhausted without registration of the claim.
