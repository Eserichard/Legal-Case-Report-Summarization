<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 773">However, as Gyles J stated in Tosich v Tasman Investment Management Ltd [2008] FCA 377 ; (2008) 250 ALR 274 at 284, "a bare right to litigate requires special consideration". To that group of actions or rights requiring special consideration I would add statutory causes of action. For example, Davies J held in Park v Allied Mortgage Corporation Ltd [1993] FCA 286 ; [1993] ATPR (Digest) 46-105 at 53,469 that "a right to claim damages under ss 82 and 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("TPA") is, in general, a bare right of action which cannot be assigned". This was followed in Allstate Life Insurance Co v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [1994] FCA 814 and upheld by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 at 733 and cf Beatty v Brashs Pty Ltd [1998] 2 VR 201 at 215. </sentence>
