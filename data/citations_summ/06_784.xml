<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] SASC 272">In these circumstances, Wilcox J found that it was foreseeable that, if the employer broke its promises to a particular employee, it might cause distress. [574] His Honour held that this brought the case within the Baltic exception stated most appositely by Brennan J as: [575] 
 
 If a contract contains a promise, express or implied, that the promisor will not cause the promisee, or will protect the promisee from, disappointment of mind, it cannot be said that disappointment of mind resulting from breach of the promise is too remote. Such a promise is expressed or implied in many contracts the object of which is to provide a service or facility conducive to peace of mind, tranquility of environment or ease of living and damages have been awarded accordingly. (Footnotes omitted. ) 
 
  In the case of McDonald [568] there was also discussion of damages, this time in the context of an implied term of mutual trust and confidence. The Full Court held that such a breach if it did exist did not entitle the plaintiff to damages for injury to reputation and injured feelings as a result of such a dismissal. [569] 
In his oral submissions, counsel for the plaintiff sought to characterise the alleged breach of s 5 of the PSM Act as coming within the Baltic exception, thus opening the way for damages under these heads. [570] Counsel placed heavy reliance on the Federal Court decision of Wilcox J in Nikolich v Goldman Sachs J B Were Services Pty Ltd . [571] In that case, the terms of the appellant's contract of employment were found to include a document created by the employer entitled Working With Us ("WWU"). [572] WWU set out, in voluminous terms, the employer's commitment to its employees. Section headings included: "Support for Career Management", "Support for Ideas and Innovation", "Support for Personal Time", "Support for Heath and Well-being", "Support for Community Involvement", "Support for Families", "Support for Parents" and "Support for Personal Issues".  Wilcox J found that the respondent had breached three sub-sections of the WWU document. His Honour found that the purpose of these sub-sections was: [573] 
 
 to provide assurance to existing and prospective [Goldman Sachs] employees concerning the manner in which they would be treated in their workplace and, in particular, about the support they would be offered by their employer. The 'very object' was to provide peace of mind.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 411">In order to be compensated for any loss or damage under s.82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), Mr Alam needs to establish a causal connection between Mr Henderson's conduct and the loss for which he seeks compensation. He also has to prove that he relied upon the conduct and that this reliance caused damage. This has been interpreted to mean that the loss or damage must be caused by reason of, or as a result of, the contravening conduct. Accordingly, any loss or damage that is caused by the contravening conduct can be recovered under s.82. There is no requirement that the loss or damage be assessed in any different way than under the general law. Neither is there any restriction to the common law concepts as to the nature and extent of damages recoverable. Damages under s.82 approximate to damages recovered in tort. The assessment of damage under s.82 was considered in Nikolich v Goldman Sachs JB Were Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 784 per Wilcox J at [298] --- [307].

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] VSC 9">154 But it is important to place the court's conclusions in the relevant factual context, in particular: 
 
 (i) When Mr Nikolich received Goldman's letter of offer, it also provided him with several documents including the WWU. [96] On appeal, Jessup J regarded this as 'a most relevant circumstance' and held that 'the contemporaneous provision of WWU was a circumstance proper to be taken into account in drawing the inference' as to what the parties had intended. [97] 
 
(ii) Mr Nikolich was required to read the WWU and sign some forms contained within it. [98] Importantly, he was asked to sign off on the employer's health and safety statement; he was asked to state that he had read and understood the statement and to acknowledge, in effect, that it outlined his obligations as a team member. Also, in both cases, the relevant secondary document clearly purported to impose obligations on the employer, some, at least, of which are obligations customarily found in employment contracts and which would otherwise be absent from the employment contract. Accordingly, it seems to me that the approach taken in Riverwood has application to this case. [100] 
 

On appeal, Marshall J adopted the trial judge's conclusion and found it compelling; [101] Jessup J found that his Honour was wrong to apply Riverwood in the circumstances and that the 'General Instructions' provision of the letter of offer did not operate to incorporate WWU into the contract [102] ; and Black CJ decided the appeal on a different basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 964">In order to be compensated for any loss and damage under s.82(1) of the TPA, Mr Roberts needs to establish a causal connection between UNE's conduct and the loss for which he seeks compensation. He also has to prove that he relied on the conduct and that this reliance caused damage. This has been interpreted to mean that the loss or damage must be caused by reason of, or as a result of, the contravening conduct. Accordingly, only loss or damage that is caused by the contravening conduct can be recovered under s.82. There is no requirement that loss or damage be assessed in any different way than under the general law. Neither is there any restriction to common law concepts as to the nature and extent of damages recoverable. Damages under s.82 approximate the damages recoverable in tort. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider cases involving misleading or deceptive conduct and the making of false statements in measuring damages in tort: Brown &amp; Anor v Jam Factory Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [1981] FCA 35 ; (1981) 35 ALR 79 per Fox J.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] NSWIRComm 1039">21 The applicant also submitted that she did not seek to argue procedural failings on the part of the employer, but instead complained that she was not given her "rights" as set out in her conditions of employment. The applicant said that these conditions of employment were derived by reference to the case of Nikolich v Goldman Sachs JB Were Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 784 . Further the applicant referred to the case of Russell v The Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney and Anor [2007] NSW SC 104 . The applicant said that this Judgement was relied upon as the employer had destroyed the applicant's trust and confidence in her contract of employment as a permanent Teacher at Kingswood High School.

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] VSCA 107">116 In support of these submissions, counsel relied on two decisions of the Federal Court of Australia, Riverwood International Australia Pty Ltd v McCormick [39] and Nikolich v Goldman Sachs J B Were Services Pty Ltd, [40] which held that an employer's human resource policies were incorporated by reference into an implied term in the contract of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] VSC 136">27 In his award the arbitrator concluded that this case fell within this fifth exception, as it was explained by Wilcox J in Nikolich v Goldman Sachs JB Were Services Pty Ltd. [10] In that case, which concerned the wrongful dismissal of an employee engaged as client investment adviser, the court found that the employer breached terms of the contract with respect to health and safety, harassment and grievance procedures. [11] 

It was, however, not necessary for his Honour to reach a final conclusion as to this, because the applicant's case there fell within another of the exceptions, that where the breach caused personal injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 32">The respondent submitted that the applicant bore the onus of strictly complying with Regulation 12.8 because these were proceedings in which a penalty is sought. Reliance was placed on Nikolich v Goldman Sachs J B Were Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 784 at [163] --- [167] and [174].

 "medical certificate" as meaning: a certificate signed by a registered health practitioner "registered health practitioner" as meaning: a health practitioner registered, or licensed, as a health practitioner (or as a health practitioner of a particular type) under a law of the a State or Territory that provides for the registration or licensing of health practitioners (or health practitioners of that type). Consideration of s.659(2)(a) and reg.2.12.8 
 The Federal Court has considered the interaction between, and construction of, s.659(2)(a) and reg.2.12.8 and their statutory forebears. [11] In the context of the current provisions of the WR Act (s.659(2)(a)) and WR Regs (reg.2.12.8) that consideration establishes that: reg.2.12.8 is an exhaustive statement of what constitutes a temporary absence from work under s.659(2)(a); [12] and if a particular absence does not fall within the matters defined in reg.2.12.8 then s.659(2)(a) has no application (even if ordinarily the particular absence could be said to be a temporary absence). [13] It is therefore necessary, for an absence to be a "temporary absence from work" under s.659(2)(a), that one of the preconditions in reg.2.12.8 be met. [14] Consideration of this case
 In this case the provisions of reg.2.12.8(1)(a) and (c) do not arise, it being common ground that Mr Rogers: did not provide a medical certificate; and was not required to provide Millennium with a required document.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] NSWSC 159">330 During the course of oral submissions, the Health Service relied upon the judgment of Wilcox J in Nikolich v Goldman Sachs J B Were Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 784. In the circumstances of the matter before Wilcox J, his Honour took the view that the terms of an information book entitled "Working With Us" (WWU) formed part of the contract of employment with legally enforceable obligations. When reliance was placed upon the judgment of Wilcox J in Nikolich , I informed counsel that a Full Court of the Federal Court had reserved on an appeal from that judgment and indicated that I would receive submissions on the Full Court judgment when it was available or, on request, call the matter on for further hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FCAFC 120">103 His Honour Justice Wilcox heard the matter at first instance (see Nikolich v Goldman Sachs JB Were Services Pty Limited [2006] FCA 784). His Honour dismissed Mr Nikolich's claims, other than an aspect of the breach of contract claim. His Honour awarded damages to Mr Nikolich, who he considered suffered a major depressive disorder as a consequence of "the events the subject of the proceeding". Goldman now appeals from that order.</sentence>

She contends, and for present purposes I would be prepared to accept, that the existence of a diagnosed psychiatric illness takes the case out of the principle in Baltic Shipping Company v Dillon [1993] HCA 4 ; (1993) 176 CLR 344: see Nikolich v Goldman Sachs J B Were Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 784. However, I reject this claim upon two bases: first, the claim travels outside anything in the applicant's Statement of Claim; and secondly, there was no suggestion in the evidence that the applicant's psychiatric illness was caused or contributed to by the termination of her employment or by the circumstances thereof. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2006] NFSC 7">118 In Nikolich v Goldman Sachs JB Were Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 784 at [290] - [305], I reviewed those principles. I need not repeat what I then said. It is sufficient to note that I concluded that s 82 of the TPA did not permit the applicant in that case to recover damages stemming from the failure of the respondent to act in accordance with an expectation generated by its conduct; damages may only be awarded for loss or damage caused by the relevant misleading or deceptive conduct. When that distinction is applied to the present case, it follows that NIA is not entitled to damages under the FTA for losses suffered as a result of any failure of its expectation that SMEC would act in accordance with the CEA or the PMA, unless NIA could show it was induced by that expectation to take, or refrain from taking, some other course of action. Subject to that exception, NIA can recover, under s 37 of the FTA, only such loss or damage as was caused by the misleading or deceptive conduct itself.</sentence>
