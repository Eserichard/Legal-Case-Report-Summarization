Although there is no authority in this Court directly on point I note that in Ogawa v Phipps [2006] FCA 361 ; (2006) 151 FCR 311 , which concerned a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court, Finkelstein J made an order in the nature of mandamus requiring Phipps FM to order that the proceeding be transferred to the Federal Court.
