<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1328">1 On 12 June last I made orders under s 447A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) in relation to an extension of the "decision period" provided for by s 441A(1)(b) ( Australian Capital Reserve Limited (Administrators Appointed) v High Tower Investments Pty Limited (Administrators Appointed); in the matter of High Tower Investments Pty Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 1028). On 15 June last I made orders extending the convening period for the meeting of creditors required to be held under s 439A of the Act to midnight on 23 July 2007. I reserved consideration of any application to further extend that period indicating that, if a case were made out, I would exercise the power provided for by s 447A to achieve that end. Reasons for that decision were given together with reasons in relation to an extension of the convening period in relation to the related Estate Property group of companies (the Group) ( Hayes, in the matter of Estate Property Group Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 935). Those various judgments, together with the judgment relating to the Estate Property group of companies to be handed down contemporaneously with these reasons ( Hayes, in the matter of Estate Property Group Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 1329) , explain the background to this application, which need not be repeated here.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1329">1 On 15 June 2007 I made orders extending the convening period for the meeting of creditors required to be held under s 439A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) to midnight 23 July 2007 in relation to a number of companies, being the members of what is known as the Estate Property Group (the Group), together with some ancillary orders on the application of the administrators of the companies in the Group (the Administrators) ( Hayes, in the matter of Estate Property Group Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 935). In a related application concerning Australian Capital Reserve Limited (Administrators Appointed) (ACR), on 12 June 2007 orders were made extending the "decision period" provided for by s 441A(1)(b) of the Act to the last day of the convening period for a number of companies in the Group ( Australian Capital Reserve Limited (Administrators Appointed) v High Tower Investments Pty Limited (Administrators Appointed); in the matter of High Tower Investments Pty Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 1028). On 13 July 2007 the convening period for the second meeting of creditors of those companies was further extended to midnight on 31 August 2007 utilising the provisions of s 447A(1) of the Act to achieve that result and certain ancillary orders were made. I indicated then that I would give reasons for those orders in due course. These are those reasons. These reasons should be read with those in Hall, in the matter of Australian Capital Reserve Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 1328 to be delivered contemporaneously. The background to these reasons is set out in the various judgments to which I have referred and need not be repeated.</sentence>
