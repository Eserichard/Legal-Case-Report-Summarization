<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 624">Even if there had been some error in relation to s.420 , it would not amount to jurisdictional error ( Applicant S296 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1166 at [6] per Gyles J and Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 ; (2004) 78 ALJR 992 at [45] per Gummow and Hayne JJ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 56">Difficult questions may also arise where a claimant may nevertheless be "fit" to participate in a hearing before the Tribunal but where his physical and emotional condition is nevertheless a matter to be taken into account by the Tribunal, particularly when assessing credibility: eg, WAJR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 106 ; 204 ALR 624 per French J. [18] Where a claimant is "unfit" to participate effectively in a hearing before the Tribunal, it may be that the Tribunal should adjourn or postpone the hearing until a later date: Applicant S296 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1166 . But, as Gyles J there noted, "[t]here will be circumstances where the incapacity of an Applicant is such that the review by the Tribunal simply must take place without the benefit of oral evidence or oral contribution from the Applicant": [2006] FCA 1166 at [6]. His Honour was not there called upon to illustrate the "circumstances" which could lead to such a conclusion. [19] A failure on the part of a Tribunal to give a claimant "a reasonable opportunity to present evidence and argument" has, in the past, had the consequence that the Tribunal "did not reach a decision after considering evidence and argument" and the further consequence that "the Tribunal did not conduct a review as required by the Act".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 704">I accept that the preferable construction of the Act was taken by Gyles J in an observation in Applicant S296 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1166 at [6] : 6 I take that view not because of any general fault in the reasoning of the Tribunal, but because of the wider context in which that decision came to be made. There can be no general disagreement with the proposition that the Tribunal is under a duty to deal with a review in a 'fair, just, economical, informal and quick' manner (s 420). There will be circumstances where the incapacity of an applicant is such that the review by the Tribunal simply must take place without the benefit of oral evidence or oral contribution from that applicant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 585">Where a claimant is " unfit " to participate effectively in a hearing before the Tribunal, it may be that the Tribunal should adjourn or postpone the hearing until a later date: Applicant S 296 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1166. But, as Gyles J there noted, " [t]here will be circumstances where the incapacity of an applicant is such that the review by the Tribunal simply must take place without the benefit of oral evidence or oral contribution from the applicant ": [2006] FCA 1166 at [6] . His Honour was not there called upon to illustrate the " circumstances " which could lead to such a conclusion.  Where a claimant is " unfit " to participate effectively in a hearing before the Tribunal, it may be that the Tribunal should adjourn or postpone the hearing until a later date: Applicant S 296 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1166.

His Honour was not there called upon to illustrate the " circumstances " which could lead to such a conclusion. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1613">55 The appellant, relying upon the medical certificate, had sought an adjournment in order that he might at a later date take up the critically important invitation to appear before the Tribunal. A refusal of an application for an adjournment for this reason may amount to procedural unfairness: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [40] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ; Applicant NAHF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 140 ; (2003) 128 FCR 359 at [31] - [39]; Applicant S296 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1166 at [5] . Such, arguably, was the case here. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCAFC 142">93 SCAR was mentioned in support of a decision recently given by Gyles J in Applicant S296/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1166. In that case, however, the Tribunal had refused to adjourn a hearing on the grounds of the applicant's psychiatric condition. While finding no 'general fault in the reasoning of the Tribunal' Gyles J held that in the particular circumstances of the case there had been an unreasonable refusal of an opportunity to present a case which was sufficient to breach the rules of procedural fairness (at [5]). </sentence>
