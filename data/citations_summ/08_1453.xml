<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 594">After I formed the above view and informed the parties, Mr Priestley, in effect, sought leave to reopen his applications for leave to appeal in order to raise further matters as to why leave should be granted. He raised matters that were the subject of previous decisions by me in relation to the alleged invalidity of s 31A of the Federal Court Act and O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules ( Priestley v Godwin (No 3) [2008] FCA 1529 ; (2008) 172 FCR 139) and in relation to the applicability of the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT) ( Priestley v Godwin (No 2) [2008] FCA 1453 ; (2008) 171 FCR 493). He also raised allegations, unsupported by evidence, of what he termed bias and jurisdictional error. I dealt with Mr Priestley's allegations of bias in Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 1179. Those allegations were also the subject of an application to the High Court and were described by French CJ as ' not tenable ' ( Priestley v Godwin (Parliamentary Service Merit Protection Commissioner) [2008] HCA 59 ; (2008) 251 ALR 612 at [31] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 169">The Chief Justice recorded that one of the grounds on which Mr Priestley challenged the primary judge's ability to sit was an alleged breach of s 21 of the Human Rights Act 2004 of the Australian Capital Territory arising in some way out of her Honour's refusal to recuse herself after he had made allegations of bias against her. That refusal was the subject of a judgment the primary judge had delivered at an earlier time ( Priestley v Godwin (No 2) [2008] FCA 1453) and is not before me. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] HCA 59">On 25 September 2008 her Honour gave judgment dismissing the fourth disqualification application [4] .</sentence>
