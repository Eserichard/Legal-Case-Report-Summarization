<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 592">In Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1516 , Moore J held: 
 
 ... [A]ll s 25(2) does is confer appellate jurisdiction on single judges and Full Courts to deal with applications for leave to appeal. Order 52, r 2AA prescribes, in my opinion unexceptionably, the mechanism that determines whether this jurisdiction will be exercised by a single judge, on the one hand, or a Full Court, on the other. As Buchanan J correctly observed in McDonald's Australia Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) [2008] FCA 395 ; (2008 69 ATR 898 , referring to his Honour's earlier judgment in Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 , the provisions of O 52, r 2AA admit no debate about the existence of any such right of election. There is none. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 241">An application for leave to appeal may be heard either by a single judge or by the Full Court: Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 25(2)(a). Order 52 r 2AA further provides as follows: 
 
 Exercise of appellate jurisdiction 
 An application mentioned in subsection 25 (2) of the Act must be heard and determined by a single Judge unless: 
 (a) a Judge directs that the application be heard and determined by a Full Court; or 
 (b) the application is made in a proceeding that has already been assigned to a Full Court, and the Full Court considers it is appropriate for it to hear and determine the application. 
 
 
 
Accordingly, a party has no " right to an election " as to whether any application for leave should be heard by a single Judge as opposed to a Full Court. As to any such asserted right, " there is none ": Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1516 at [4] , [2008] FCA 1516 ; 172 FCR 469 at 471. The present proceeding has not as yet been assigned to a Full Court. And, notwithstanding some reservation, it is considered that the present application should not be referred to a Full Court. But for:
 the primary Judge's further observations extending beyond his conclusion as to the competency of the appeal pursuant to s 44 of the 1975 Act; and the Respondent's acceptance of the ability of the Applicant to make any such further application as he sees fit for a further summons different in terms to those that have already been rejected, 
 a different conclusion may have been reached as to whether the present application should be resolved by a Full Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 34">A number of these factors emerge from cases including Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 47 , TS Production LLC [2008] FCA 1329 , Zegarac v Pitcher Partners [2009] FCA 1061 , Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 849 and Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1516 ; (2008) 172 FCR 469.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCAFC 105">Pursuant to O 52 r 2AA(a) of the Federal Court Rules , Middleton J on 2 April 2009 made an order that the application for leave was to be heard by a Full Court. Whatever prior " uncertainty " there may have been as to a right to elect to make an application for leave to either a single judge or the Full Court, that " uncertainty " has now been resolved by O 52 r 2AA. " There is none ": Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1516 at [4] [2008] FCA 1516 ; , 172 FCR 469 at 471 per Moore J. On 7 April 2009 His Honour further ordered that the " application for leave to appeal and any appeal be heard instanter ". Those are the matters now before this Court. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1985">A prior Notice of Motion seeking to have the present proceeding heard in this Court with a jury was dismissed: Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1403. An application for leave to appeal that decision has also been dismissed: Harding v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1516. The present Application is thus to be heard by a Judge of this Court, sitting alone. </sentence>
