<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 23">As discussed in Natural Waters of Viti Ltd v Dayals (Fiji) Artesian Waters Ltd [2007] FCA 200 ; (2007) 71 IPR 571 , a number of factors may be relevant to establishing sufficient reputation evidence. There Bennett J noted that (at [59]): 
 
 The reputation which must be proved in a case such as this is that the get-up, packaging, shape, or trade dress relied upon is associated by consumers with the applicant's product. It takes a strong case to establish a reputation of this nature (Interlego at 386) as consumers will not necessarily associate a get-up with the applicant's product ( Collins Debden Pty Ltd v Cumberland Stationery Co Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1398 at [33] to [34] per Lindgren J). The requisite reputation will more readily be found where the get-up is unique or striking rather than descriptive, mundane, merely functional, or in common use.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 2">As with passing off, whether or not impugned conduct is misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, is to be determined at the time the impugned conduct commenced, that is, in May 2009: see Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd [1982] FCA 136 ; (1982) 42 ALR 177 (' Taco Bell ') at 195-196 and 203-204 per Deane and Fitzgerald JJ; Thai Wood Import &amp; Export Co Ltd v Shuey Shing Pty Ltd (1989) 17 IPR 289 at 302 per Gummow J; Anheuser-Busch Inc v Budejovicky Budvar (2002) 56 IPR 182 at 237 per Allsop J; Dr Martens at 363 per Goldberg J; and Natural Waters of Viti Ltd v Dayals (Fiji) Artesian Waters Ltd [2007] FCA 200 ; (2007) 71 IPR 571 (' Natural Waters ') at 585 per Bennett J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] ATMO 94">Although the article postdates the filing date of the application, it refers to a factory which is of sufficient long-standing to be able to claim to have closed for renovations. The water bottling industry in Fiji was also large enough to have an association and a spokesman. In Natural Waters of Viti Limited v Dayals ( Fiji ) Artesian Waters Limited [2007] FCA 200 , at paragraph 62, Bennett J summarises the history of the Dayals water-bottling: 
 
 Mr Dayal began researching the possibilities of setting up a water bottling business in Fiji to cater for what he perceived to be a growing market demand for bottled water in 2001. Artesian Waters purchased land for commercial production bore-wells in February 2002. It obtained authorisation to proceed with construction in or about January 2004. As shown in the matter Natural Waters of Viti Limited v Dayals (Fiji) Artesian Waters Limited [2007] FCA 200 , there is at least one other trader in Fiji who bottles water for export to Australia. And, according to an article on Radio New Zealand on 7 July 2008: 
 
 The water bottling industry is outraged at the sealing off of a member's plant by the Fiji Islands and Revenue Customs Authority or FIRCA. Fiji Times online says three FIRCA officers sealed off the bottling area at Mineral Waters of Fiji, which bottles Viti Blu, on Johnson Road, in Lautoka, yesterday morning. Concerning the history of the trade mark on the Australian market, it is convenient to quote Bennett J in Natural Waters of Viti Ltd [1] v Dayals (Fiji) Artesian Waters Ltd [2007] FCA 200 ; (2007) 71 IPR 571 at paragraph 7 and subsequently at paragraph 50: 
 
 Fiji Water is the first bottled water product to originate from Fiji. From about mid 2003 to mid 2006, Fiji Water was bottled and distributed in Australia by Natural Waters in a get-up (the 2003 get-up) which included the name "Fiji Natural Spring Water". The 2003 get-up

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 406">78 The evidence necessary or sufficient to establish reputation to found a case for passing off and contravention of the TPA will depend upon various factors (see eg Natural Waters of Viti Limited v Dayals (Fiji) Artesian Waters Limited [2007] FCA 200 ; (2007) 71 IPR 571 at [58] - [59] ). Reputation may be inferred from a high volume of sales and extensive advertising, without any other direct evidence (see in a different context, Kenny J in McCormick &amp; Company Inc v McCormick [2000] FCA 1335 ; (2000) 51 IPR 102 at [86] - [88]. In this proceeding, there are no sales or direct advertising or promotion of Hansen's product in Australia. Rather, the evidence relied upon is that of exposure to persons in Australia through the marketing strategy adopted by Hansen to reach its target demographic primarily in other countries. </sentence>
