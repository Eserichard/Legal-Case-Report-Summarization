<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 201">Contrary to the applicant's claims now, this account shows that the Tribunal asked very specific questions about the applicant's claims (see for example [45] at CB 133, [54], [56], [60] at CB 135 and [64] at CB 136 to [75] at CB 138). In any event, as the Minister submits, the questions to be asked are a matter for the Tribunal to assist in its assessment of the claims. I cannot see error in circumstances where the Tribunal sought to give shape and direction to the hearing to see whether it could reach the requisite level of satisfaction as to the merits of the claims such that the visa must then be granted ( SZGGD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1250). </sentence>
