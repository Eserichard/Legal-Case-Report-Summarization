<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 789">12 As was correctly concluded by the Federal Magistrates Court, there is no obligation upon an administrative tribunal, and no obligation imposed upon the Refugee Review Tribunal, to refer to each piece of evidence placed before it for consideration and no obligation to either explain why it accepts or rejects particular evidence. An administrative tribunal is thus not normally required to state what evidence is accepted, rejected or taken into account with respect to findings of fact: cf Guy v Repatriation Commission [2002] FCA 525 , 74 ALD 617. An administrative tribunal is not required " to give a subset of reasons [as to] why it accepted or rejected individual pieces of evidence ": cf Chief Executive Officer of Customs v ICB Medical Distributors Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1538 at [44] , [2007] FCA 1538 ; 97 ALD 746 at 755.</sentence>
