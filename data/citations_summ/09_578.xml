<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 70">The grounds of appeal appear to raise issues which were not pleaded or argued below. In order to raise new arguments on appeal the appellant requires the leave of the Court. The leading cases and principles applicable to the grant of such leave were considered in detail in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1285">Ground 2 was not previously raised below, so leave is required. The discretion to grant leave to rely on a ground of appeal not raised below was summarised by Flick J in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7] - [11]. The primary question is whether it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so: In VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 , Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ stated (at [46] to [48]): 
 
 
 [46] ... Leave to argue a ground of appeal not raised before the primary judge should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so: O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 ; H v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; and Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at [20] - [24] and [38]. 
 
 

 
 
 
 [47] In Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 , Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ observed, in their joint judgment, at 7:
 It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1287">Particular 1 to the alleged breach of s 425 of the Act was not raised before the Federal Magistrate. If an extension of time to file the notice of appeal were granted, leave would be required to raise it now. The factors relevant to a grant of leave to raise a new ground on appeal were discussed by Flick J in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7] - [11]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1286">The factors relevant to the grant of leave to appeal on the ground not raised below were considered in detail by Flick J in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7]- [11]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1268">Madgwick J in NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [166] outlined the relevant considerations to be addressed when an application is made to raise a ground of appeal not raised below. Such considerations include the prospects of success of the ground and whether any explanation exists as to why such ground was not previously raised. See also SZKCQ v Minster for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7] - [11]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 1249">Ground 1 was not raised before the Federal Magistrate. Therefore, the appellant requires leave to raise that ground in this Court. The principles relevant to the exercise of the discretion to grant leave to an appellant to rely on new grounds of appeal not raised at first instance were explained by Flick J in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7]---[11]. The primary consideration is whether "it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so" ( VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] ---[48]). Whether the new grounds have a reasonable prospect of success is a matter which is relevant to the exercise of the discretion ( NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [166] (p 85)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 1252">The approach of the Court to determining the question whether leave should be granted is set out in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7] to [11]. One issue to be considered is whether the new legal argument has reasonable prospects of success. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 855">The principles relevant to the exercise of the discretion to grant leave to an appellant to rely on new grounds of appeal not raised at first instance were summarised by Flick J in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7] ---[11]. The authorities canvassed by his Honour establish that the primary consideration is whether it is "expedient in the interests of justice to do so" ( VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158). Whether the new grounds have a reasonable prospect of success is a matter which is relevant to the exercise of the discretion ( NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [166] (p 85) per Madgwick J). In my view, the claims agitated in Grounds 2 and 5 contained in the appellant's Notice of Appeal have no prospects of success (see below at [46]---[50] and [55]). I am, therefore, not prepared to grant leave to the appellant to raise these new grounds of appeal. Ground 1 (The Tribunal's Failure to Provide the Appellant with an Opportunity to Obtain Interpreting Services When Responding to the s 424A Letter and the Tribunal's Failure to Provide Adequate Interpreting Services at the Tribunal Hearing) 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FMCA 210">Further, the applicant did not request time to comment, or to provide any other information, pursuant to s.424AA(b) (Court Book 81). 
 Section 359AA does not of itself impose a separate obligation on the Tribunal with which a failure to comply results in jurisdictional error. SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 
at [19] . Section 359AA is in the same terms as s.424AA. Ibid at [74].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] FCA 201">The appellant seeks leave to raise these matters now as grounds of appeal. The principles upon which such leave is granted have been discussed recently in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7] - [10] and SZNHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 51 at [19] - [21]. The appellant was unable to advance any reason why these matters were not raised in the proceeding before the Federal Magistrates Court other than to say that he knows nothing about the law. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] FCA 51">Putting to one side their undoubted similarity to other notices which have been filed in this Court, there is a more fundamental obstacle to the appellants' putting their grounds as they have. By their notice of appeal to this Court, they seek to rely on grounds which were not raised before the Federal Magistrate. Ordinarily, an appeal court will be slow to entertain arguments which were not before the court of first instance. The reasons for that approach have been explained by the High Court in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 , per Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ, at 7 et seq. In the migration context, a Full Court of this Court said, in VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 , at [48], that: 
 
 The practice of raising arguments for the first time before the Full Court has been particularly prevalent in appeals relating to migration matters. The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below, but which clearly has merit, is advanced, and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated. Where, however, there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused. 
 

 
See too WAJR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 106 ; (2004) 204 ALR 624 , per French J, at 629 and SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 , per Flick J, at [7]-[10]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FCA 1436">In the present proceeding, three considerations (at least) warrant attention, namely: to raise on appeal grounds not previously relied upon requires the leave of the Court; the role of this Court as an appellate court and the role that this Court plays in respect to any subsequent application that may be made to appeal to the High Court of Australia; and relevant to the grant or refusal of leave are various factors, including the fact that a ground sought to be raised was previously abandoned. 
Although these three considerations may be separately identified, consideration of any one of them may well overlap with consideration of another. Each of these considerations has also been repeatedly addressed in decisions of this Court --- but some brief overview of these considerations is perhaps appropriate, lest the Appellant be left with the impression that his appeal has been dismissed on a " technicality " divorced from principle or merit. It is in that context that a fourth consideration should also be addressed, namely:
 the merit of the new grounds sought to be raised. The serious consequences that may attend a wrongful refusal of a protection visa may also be taken into account when determining whether it is expedient in the interests of justice that leave be given: SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886 at [16] per Branson J. The serious consequences that attend the refusal of leave to raise a new ground in any appeal is, however, a matter warranting careful consideration and migration cases --- it is considered --- attract no different consideration: cf SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [9] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCA 1378">The ground referred to in the appellant's submissions is new and the appellant requires leave to rely upon it. Matters for the Court to consider when deciding whether to grant leave are discussed in NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [166] , see also SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7] - [11]. The Court is required to consider the new ground sought to be raised, in order to determine if it is ' expedient in the interests of justice ' to allow the new ground to be argued and determined: see VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168 at [26] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FCA 1345">The issues to be considered on an application for leave to raise issues on appeal which were previously not before the Federal Magistrate are conveniently summarised in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7] - [11]. One such authority referred to in that summary is that of Madgwick J in NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [166] in which his Honour stated eight factors which should guide the discretion to grant leave for an appellant to rely on new grounds of appeal. His Honour said: 
 
 Thus, relevant questions include: 
 
 Do the new legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success?</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FCA 1247">A detailed overview of authority discussing when leave should be granted for new grounds to be argued on appeal is to be found in the decision of Flick J in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7] - [11]. The Court has had regard to those authorities, particularly the decision of Madgwick J in NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [166] in which his Honour stated eight factors guiding the exercise of discretion to grant leave for an appellant to rely on new grounds of appeal. Those grounds were: Do the new legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success?</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FMCA 963">Ms Baw relied on SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 per Flick J, where in dealing with the issue of whether the Tribunal, in that case, failed to comply with s.424AA(b)(iv), his Honour said: "18. Perhaps some degree of latitude is appropriate when determining what is sufficient to bring to the attention of the Tribunal that an applicant wishes to have further time in which to respond to "information". There is certainly no requirement that a request need be in writing. Even a formal and express oral request for additional time may not be appropriate or necessary. The Tribunal, it is to be recalled, is given the mandate to conduct its review functions in a manner that is "fair, just, economical, informal and quick" (Migration Act 1958 (Cth) s 420(1)) and in an "inquisitorial manner": Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 , 75 ALD 1 at [57] per Gummow and Heydon JJ and at [60] per Kirby J. In an appropriate case it may thus be manifestly apparent to the Tribunal that an applicant is in fact seeking additional time --- even though he has not said so. But there is nothing now before this Court to indicate that the Appellant was not willing to respond to all of the "information" then before the Tribunal. There was, for instance, no transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal from which any inference favourable to the Appellant may have been drawn. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] FCA 973">The question whether leave should be granted to argue points which have not been taken below has been the subject of a number of judgments of this court in recent years. The principles by reference to which such applications should be approached were referred to in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 , [7]-[11]. Foremost amongst those principles, particularly in a case such as the present where the respondent to the appeal does not assert prejudice, are whether the appellants have put forward a satisfactory explanation for their failure to run the points below and whether the points sought to be raised would have reasonable prospects of success. Because of the view I take in relation to those two considerations, it will not be necessary for me to turn to other discretionary matters which might bear upon the course taken in less clear cases. </sentence>
