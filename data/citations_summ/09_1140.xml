<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWCA 60">Conformably with the weighing or balancing process discussed in NLC and inhering within s 130 , relevant considerations to take into account are whether the documents concern policy, the currency and contemporaneous controversiality of the subject matter, the character of the subject matter otherwise, for instance whether national security or high policy and the forensic relevance of the documents: see the Full Court in Commonwealth v Northern Land Council (1991) 30 FCR 1 at 38; North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service Inc v Bradley [2001] FCA 1080 at [16] (Wilcox J); Betfair Pty Ltd v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140 ; 181 FCR 66 at [34] (Jagot J); and RP Data v Western Australian Land Information Authority [2010] FCA 922; 188 FCR 378 at [23] (Barker J).

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 196">I have had the benefit of very helpful submissions from senior counsel for both the State and Sportsbet Pty Ltd (Sportsbet). The general principles applicable to a claim for public interest immunity at this stage of the proceeding are the common law principles: Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 ; Queanbeyan City Council v ACTEW Corporation Ltd [2008] FCA 1983 ; (2008) 253 ALR 121 at [7] per Stone J. Those principles are conveniently set out in the reasons for judgment of McLellan CJ in Murrumbidgee Ground-Water Preservation Association v Minister for Natural Resources [2003] NSWLEC 322 at [19] , and by Jagot J in Betfair Pty Ltd v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140 ; (2009) 181 FCR 66. In determining the claim for public interest immunity, the Court may inspect the documents in issue, although as a starting point it is not routinely done. As was said in Commonwealth v Northern Land Council (1991) 30 FCR 1 at 36-37, the Court should conduct a "kind of anticipatory balancing exercise" to decide whether a document should be inspected. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] WASC 280">15 Where it is necessary for the court to weigh the competing public interests, the weight of the public interest in disclosure for the purposes of the litigation will be affected by the nature of the litigation. So, where the documents only came into existence because the applicant was asking for a privilege and was submitting his character and reputation to scrutiny, the weight attached to disclosure will be less than a case in which the documents are being used to deprive someone of a legal right - see Lord Reid in Rogers v Home Secretary at 401. Similarly, where a person's liberty is at stake (as is the case in these proceedings), production is more likely to be ordered - see Gibbs ACJ (at 42) and Stephen J (at 61 - 62) in Sankey ; Alister v The Queen [1984] HCA 85 ; (1984) 154 CLR 404 , 414, Murrumbidgee Ground Water Preservation Association v Minister for Natural Resources [2003] NSWLEC 322 at [19] ; Betfair Pty Ltd v Racing New South Wales [No 7] [2009] FCA 1140 ; (2009) 181 FCR 66 at [5] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 922">In North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service Inc v Bradley [2001] FCA 1080 , at [16] and in Betfair Pty Ltd v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140 ; (2009) 181 FCR 66 , at [34], the Federal Court of Australia (Wilcox J and Jagot J respectively) considered that, if the weighing exercise is to be conducted, there is a further factor to be regarded, namely, the protection of the public interest in ensuring that advice may be given to government without inhibition by reason of the risk of subsequent disclosure, which indicates that consideration must also be given to the nature and the subject matter of the documents. I respectfully agree. This view is also supported by the analysis that follows. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] QCA 175">[11] One example of that principle is that (subject to any contrary statute) the fact that without prejudice communications have occurred is admissible to explain delay in commencing or prosecuting litigation. [103] 
[166] The terms of s 19(1) must be construed in their statutory context, and the appellant correctly submits that there is no basis to simply import the common law position in respect of without prejudice privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] NSWADT 72">73 In proceedings before the Federal Court Betfair Pty Ltd has challenged decisions by Racing NSW and Harness Racing NSW that it pay 1.5% of turnover as a condition of being granted approval to use racefield information. That approval has been granted under the Racing Administration Act 1998 and the Racing Administration Amendment (Publication of Race Fields) Regulation 2008. Betfair alleges that the conditions that it pay 1.5% of turnover, are unlawfully protectionist and discriminatory in breach of the guarantee of free trade in s 92 of the Commonwealth Constitution . Those proceedings have involved the consideration by the Federal Court, at both single Justice ( Betfair Pty Limited v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140) and Full Court levels ( State of New South Wales v Betfair Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 160) , of some of the same issue relating to legal professional privilege that have been agitated before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 15">Racing NSW submitted that it should not be liable for any part of Sportsbet's costs in respect of those claims for privilege raised by the State. Nor did Racing NSW seek any order for costs in respect of those claims. As to its own claim for "without prejudice" privilege, Racing NSW submitted that the costs of Sportsbet's should be costs in the cause. According to Racing NSW, whilst its claims were unsuccessful, they were properly made and maintained. The ruling in the Betfair proceeding depended on the use that Betfair intended to make of the documents (see Betfair Pty Limited v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140 at [70] - [74]). On the day those reasons were delivered (8 October 2009) Racing NSW's solicitor wrote to Sportsbet's solicitor asking that Sportsbet identify its proposed use of the documents and their relevance to the issues arising in the substantive proceeding. Sportsbet did not respond and its written submissions of 9 October 2009 did not assist in clarifying its position. At the hearing of Sportsbet's motion Racing NSW and TAB Limited, Tabcorp Holdings Limited and Luxbet Pty Limited (together,  In the Betfair proceeding Racing NSW resisted production of documents on the same basis of "without prejudice" privilege. On 8 October 2009 I ruled against Racing NSW and ordered that the documents in issue be produced to Betfair ( Betfair Pty Limited v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140). In answer to Racing NSW's submissions on costs in respect of the "without prejudice" privilege Sportsbet submitted it was and should have been obvious to Racing NSW that there was no factual distinction between the use which Sportsbet wished to make of the contested documents and their relevance to Sportsbet's substantive claims and the position of Betfair in the Betfair proceeding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 14">On 8 October 2009 I published reasons for judgment in respect of a notice of motion filed by Betfair Pty Limited ( Betfair ) on 22 September 2009 ( Betfair Pty Limited v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140). By the motion Betfair sought orders that the respondents produce certain documents for inspection over which claims for privilege had been made. The respondents resisted any order for production. The State of New South Wales ( the State ) also was granted leave to appear for the purpose of resisting the production of documents in which it had an interest. I made orders requiring the respondents to produce a number of the documents in dispute. The State sought and was granted leave to appeal against my orders. On 23 October 2009 the Full Court varied my orders, publishing reasons on 12 November 2009 ( State of New South Wales v Betfair Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 160). In substance, the Full Court overturned that part of my decision rejecting the State's claim for legal professional privilege over drafting instructions to and responses from parliamentary counsel, including draft legislative instruments. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 1283">In Betfair Pty Limited v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140 ( Betfair (No 7) ) I determined questions of privilege on the same grounds (but for parliamentary privilege) in respect of some of the same documents. The State appealed against the part of my orders rejecting its claim for legal professional privilege over communications with Parliamentary Counsel involving instructions to and the provision of draft legislation and related communications. I found that there was no express or implied request for legal advice in these communications and thus that legal professional privilege was not attracted. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCAFC 160">44 To the extent that the second proposition invoked "fairness at large" as a relevant criterion in deciding whether there had been waiver, her Honour rejected it, noting, correctly in our view, that "[t]he High Court rejected that basis of waiver in favour of the inconsistency test, 'where necessary informed by considerations of fairness'": see Betfair (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140 at [58] . Betfair did not contest this.  4 These orders were made following an application by the State of New South Wales for leave to appeal, and to appeal, from a judgment of a single judge holding that public interest immunity and legal professional privilege did not attach to certain documentary communications. The documents in question are in the possession of Racing New South Wales ('Racing NSW') and Harness Racing New South Wales ('Harness Racing NSW'). By consent, the parties provided us with copies of the documents in the form inspected and considered by the primary judge: see Betfair Pty Limited v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140 at [2] . 5 Racing NSW is a body corporate established by s 4(1) of the Thoroughbred Racing Act 1996 (NSW) and has various functions in connection with horse racing, including the control, supervision and regulation of horse racing in the State, and policy implementation and development: see s 13(1)(b) and (c). Harness Racing NSW, a body corporate constituted by s 4(1) of the Harness Racing Act 2009 (NSW), has similar functions to Racing NSW, though with respect to harness racing: see s 9(2)(a) and (c).  43 Similar submissions on waiver were rejected by the primary judge, although we accept that, as Betfair pointed out, the primary judge's ruling in this regard related to different documentary communications from those that concern us. (For this latter point, see Betfair (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140 at [60] . ) Her Honour's reasons for judgment relate that:
 Betfair's submissions appear to identify two (probably related) bases for waiver. First, that the documents were dealt with in a manner that destroyed the State's capacity to control further dissemination of the document. Second, that the documents were dealt with in a manner inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege by reason of unfairness to Betfair.  8 The State of New South Wales intervened in the proceeding before the primary judge, claiming public interest immunity and legal professional privilege over documents that Racing NSW and Harness Racing NSW had discovered. After giving the matter careful consideration, the primary judge rejected the claim for public interest immunity, and there has been no attempt to challenge this aspect of her Honour's judgment: see Betfair Pty Limited v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140 at [44] . Her Honour also rejected a claim for "without prejudice" (or settlement) privilege made by Racing NSW: see [74]. There has also been no attempt to challenge this aspect of her Honour's judgment. </sentence>
