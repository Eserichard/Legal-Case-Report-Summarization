<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] VSCA 204">33 Next, Mr Vink seeks to contend that the trial judge misinterpreted s 536 of the Act, and thus misapplied it. Mr Vink submitted that the trial judge wrongly held that, in order to fall within s 536 , Mr Vink was required to establish a prima facie case that the liquidator had not faithfully performed his duties or had not or was not observing a requirement of the Act or of regulations or rules made thereunder. This proposed ground of appeal is misconceived. The trial judge did not misinterpret s 536 as Mr Vink contends. To the contrary, the trial judge considered all of the relevant authorities and concluded that s 536 requires the complainant to establish a prima facie case "that there is something which requires inquiry. " [18] There is no error in such an approach. It is in accordance with established authority. [19] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] VSC 468">[74] Posner , supra, 74 CLR at 476 per Starke J; cf at 484 per Dixon J. [75] See, generally, Kabourakis v Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria [2005] VSC 493 (Gillard J) at [39]-[75] and cases there cited; R v Ng [2002] VSCA 108 ; (2002) 5 VR 257 at 282. See also Richmond Sales Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Robert McDermott [2006] FCA 52 (Kenny J) (Belated application to set aside a warrant to seize property after execution in civil proceedings). Compare Flanagan v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1996) 60 FCR 149 at 194-195. [76] I note that on 16 August 2006 a new sub-section (4) was inserted into s 41 of the Act, as follows: "If the Court proceeds to hear and determine a charge in the defendant's absence and finds the defendant guilty, the Court must not make a custodial order under Division 2 of Part 3 of the Sentencing Act 1991 ".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FMCA 965"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FMCA 528">The period of delay which is clear, and not satisfactorily explained before me, is at least 5 1/2 months. As has been said the issue of the period of such delay should not be reduced to a mere mathematical ("arithmetic") formula. I refer to Applicant S1338 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 52 where Stone J., at [20] states: 
 
 
 "Having said this, I do not consider that the question of unwarrantable delay ought to be answered simply by accumulating periods of delay in the conduct of the proceedings, without regard to the circumstances surrounding this delay; it is not a simple arithmetic exercise..." 
 
 
 93. At the heart of the authorities relating to delay in instigating proceedings where an applicant is aggrieved (as in this case by a Tribunal decision) is that once having become aware that a Tribunal has made an adverse decision an applicant should proceed, not necessarily in undue haste, but clearly in a reasonable and timely manner to seek relief from the Courts for the wrong that is felt to have been done. 94.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 248">1 The applicants in this matter, Robert McDermott, Maxwell Latimer and Ann Langdon, were defendants in an earlier proceeding before me. That proceeding began as an ex-parte application, filed by Paul Burness as liquidator of Richmond Sales Pty Ltd ("Richmond Sales"), for a warrant under s 530C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The procedural history of that matter is outlined in reasons for judgment delivered on 8 February 2006: see Richmond Sales Pty Ltd (In Liq) v McDermott [2006] FCA 52 at [2] - [19]. </sentence>
