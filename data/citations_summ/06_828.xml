<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 171">In Patrick Stevedores Operations No.2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (1998) 195 CLR 1 at 17-18 it was held that the phrase "injure an employee in his or her employment" covers injury of any compensable kind and that "alter the position of an employee to the employee's prejudice" is a broad additional category which covers not only legal injury but any adverse affection of, or deterioration in, the advantages enjoyed by the employee before the conduct in question. In Australian Workers' Union v BHP Iron-Ore Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 3 ; (2000) 106 FCR 482 Kenny J said at 499 [54] that before a provision such as item 1 of s.342(1) can apply, it must be possible to say of an employee that he or she is, individually speaking, in a worse situation after the employer's acts than before them, that the deterioration has been caused by those acts and that the acts were intentional in the sense that the employer intended the deterioration to occur. In McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 828 ; (2006) 154 IR 111 at 198 [349] , Greenwood J said that when injury to an employee in his or her employment or the alteration of an employee's position to his or her prejudice is alleged, an assessment of the impugned conduct calls for a comparison of the position of the employee before and after the employer's acts to determine the nature of the injury or prejudicial alteration. Injury to employee in employment
 In Childs v Metropolitan Transport Trust (1981) IAS Current Review 946 Smithers J said: I cannot help thinking that "injury" refers to deprivation of one of the more immediate practical incidents of [the employee's] employment, such as loss of pay or reduction in rank. (at 948) Nevertheless, as Ellicott J said in Squires v Flight Stewards Association of Australia (1982) 2 IR 155:

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1470">60 The respondent referred to the decision in Community and Public Sector Union v Commonwealth of Australia (2006) 157 IR 457 ; [2006] FCA 1589 , particularly at [55], where Cowdroy J referred to s 792 applying where there was an element of "singling out" of the employee or class of employees (relying on McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (2006) 154 IR 111 ; [2006] FCA 828). However, on appeal the Full Court (in allowing the appeal) noted that the decision in McIlwain in fact rejected this requirement ( Community and Public Sector Union v Commonwealth of Australia (2006) 157 IR 470 ; [2006] FCAFC 176 at [43] --- [46]). 68 First, and adopting an approach analogous to that of Greenwood J in McIlwain (2006) 154 IR 111 ; [2006] FCA 828 , I consider that the legislature has chosen to give effect to the objects of Pt 16 by, amongst other things, proscribing the carrying out of certain conduct for certain reasons including by the enactment of ss 792 and 793. To paraphrase Greenwood J at [327] the legislative expression of the objectives of Pt 16 is to be found in prohibiting nominated conduct carried out for a reason falling within the substantive provisions of the part (including, insofar as employers are concerned, s 793(1)). Those substantive provisions define the extent of the concept of freedom of association Parliament intended to regulate. Importantly, the regulation extends to conduct by employers (s 792), employees and independent contractors (s 795) and industrial associations (ss 796 --- 802). When the statutory scheme is considered as a whole, there is no need or warrant to impose additional requirements derived from the objects of Pt 16 on the substantive provisions (as further explained below). 71 The same may be said of each of the other decisions discussed above. Only one decision requires further comment, being Tristar [2008] FCA 1224. Tristar too concerned one provision only, s 793(1)(i). It also, as Gyles J said, involved an unusual claim of discrimination by reason of not being terminated. The outcome in Tristar appears to have turned on its own unusual facts. Insofar as Gyles J expressed general views about the operation of the statutory provisions, the observations in Community and Public Sector Union (2006) 157 IR 470 ; [2006] FCAFC 176 at [43] --- [46] about McIlwain (2006) 154 IR 111 ; [2006] FCA 828 and National Union of Workers v Qenos Pty Ltd (2001) 108 FCR 90 ; [2001] FCA 178 are arguably to the contrary. Finally, the decision in Tristar is subject to an unresolved appeal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] NSWSC 1441">116 Messrs Waterstreet and Lange argued that much of the Melbourne evidence is being relied upon by the Crown as tendency evidence. In my opinion, it cannot be regarded as tendency evidence. Section 97 of the Evidence Act has no application at all. The "relationship" between Benbrika and the Sydney men (providing spiritual guidance and inspiration) makes relevant to the facts in issue in the trial the cleric's extremist/fundamentalist views. The "relationship" between some of the Melbourne men and a number of the Sydney accused (facilitating acts in furtherance of the conspiracy - the Haines order; and participating in an act of furtherance - Curranyalpa) flesh out and circumstantially enliven the actions of the Sydney accused. The Melbourne evidence is not evidence of previous conduct or of a previous state of mind ( McIlwaine v Ramsay Food Packaging Pty Limited [2006] FCA 828). Rather, it is directly circumstantial in proof of actions which themselves may in turn point to the existence of a conspiracy, its nature and scope, and perhaps to its implementation by the accused. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1861">53 The ban affected all employees in the OEA, whether members of the CPSU or otherwise. However this circumstance does not lead to the conclusion that it was therefore not imposed for a 'prohibited reason'. In McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 828 ; (2006) 154 IR 111 at 355 Greenwood J said:
 
 Dismissal of employees for a prohibited reason within a group of employees some of whom may be dismissed for a non-prohibited reason does not remove the individual or bilateral character of the prejudicial conduct on the part of the employer as against that employee. It would be an odd thing if the statutory quality of contravening conduct in respect of some employees could be dissolved amongst a group and remedial entitlements otherwise available to the affected individuals thereby lost. The question is whether the conduct, from the standpoint of the individual, notwithstanding others, represents conduct carried out for a prohibited purpose. </sentence>

His Honour at [355] said:
 
 'Dismissal of employees for a prohibited reason within a group of employees some of whom may be dismissed for a non-prohibited reason does not remove the individual or bilateral character of the prejudicial conduct on the part of the employer as against that employee.

28 Mr Lever referred additionally to the recent decision of this Court in McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 828 ; (2006) 154 IR 111 , where the issue arose as to whether the refusal to employ certain persons, or more precisely to re-employ those persons, had been made inferentially for the prohibited reason of their membership of a trade union. In the course of his Honour's comprehensive reasons for judgment approximating 110 pages, Greenwood J found that the four persons the subject of the Employment Advocate's application had been refused re-employment inferentially for the prohibited reasons the subject specifically of pars (a), (h), (j), (k) and (l) of s 298L(1) of the Act. Counsel urged upon the Court a consideration of what he described as 'the very detailed and careful recent reasoning' of Greenwood J in McIlwain which followed upon his Honour's acknowledgement that the onus of establishing the various causes of action propounded in that case was placed on the applicant according to the balance of probabilities, but that s 298V stipulated for the discharge of that onus by presumption, once conduct was relevantly established ' unless the person or industrial association proves otherwise ' (to cite the concluding words of the section). The following dictum of his Honour appears at 204:
 
 'The dismissal conduct is admitted. The refusal to employ conduct is established. Having adduced evidence probative of the conduct, the assertion of the prohibited reasons gives rise to the operation of s 298V, thus enlivening the presumption which discharges the onus cast on the applicant to establish the causes of action on the balance of probabilities and casts an onus on the respondents to prove affirmatively that the prohibited reasons alleged were not a reason for the conduct.

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2006] FCAFC 176">43 The primary judge concluded that because the directive related to all employees of the OEA, and was not directed solely to members of the CPSU, it was not issued for a prohibited reason. His Honour supported that conclusion by reference, in the first instance, to a passage from the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J in McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 828 at [347] . Unfortunately the passage relied upon by his Honour is a summary by Greenwood J of a contention advanced by the respondents in that case. His Honour did not accept that contention. Rather, at [355] Greenwood J, after referring to the decision of Weinberg J in National Union of Workers v Qenos Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 178 ; (2001) 108 FCR 90 , concluded:
 
 'Dismissal of employees for a prohibited reason within a group of employees some of whom may be dismissed for a non-prohibited reason does not remove the individual or bilateral character of the prejudicial conduct on the part of the employer as against that employee. It would be an odd thing if the statutory quality of contravening conduct in respect of some employees could be dissolved amongst a group and remedial entitlements otherwise available to the affected individuals thereby lost. The question is whether the conduct, from the standpoint of the individual, notwithstanding others, represents conduct carried out for a prohibited purpose. ' </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2006] FCA 1589">55 It is an essential requirement of s 792(1) that the conduct be for a prohibited reason or for reasons that include a prohibited reason . As Greenwood J said at [347] in McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 828: 
 
 'There must be, therefore, it is said, some demonstrated element of 'singling out' of an employee or if a class of employees is involved, the class must be singled out for special treatment as a class: Health Services Union of Australia v Tasmania (1996) 73 IR 140 per Marshall J; and Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority (supra). ' 

Similar conclusions were made by Weinberg J in National Union of Workers v Quenos Pty Limited [2001] FCA 178 ; (2001) 108 FCR 90 at [118] where His Honour cites BHP Iron-Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union and Others [2000] FCA 430 ; (2000) 102 FCR 97 in relation to s 298K(1) of the unamended Act. In David's Distribution Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers [1999] FCA 1108 ; (1999) 91 FCR 463 at 500 [106] the Full Court said:
 
 'The objective of s 298K is to ensure the threat of dismissal or discriminatory treatment cannot be used by an employer to destroy or frustrate an employee's right to join an industrial association and to take an active role in that association to promote the industrial interests of both the employee and the association. ' 

In contrast to the circumstances referred to by the Full Court, the directive related to all employees of the OEA and was not directed solely to the members of the CPSU. It did not contain any threat to the working conditions of the employees nor treat them in a discriminatory manner. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2006] FCA 1302">4 On 30 June 2006, I published Reasons for Judgment and adjourned the matter to a date to be fixed to enable the Applicant to formulate short minutes of order reflecting the declarations to be made arising out of the findings contained in the reasons and to hear the parties in relation to further submissions concerning the principles governing the assessment of a compensation component described as general damages in the Applicant's Further Further Amended Statement of Claim, the principles governing whether, and if so, the basis upon which a penalty pursuant to s 298U(a) of the Act ought to be imposed, further submissions concerning the position in relation to Mr Blackadder and submissions concerning the principles guiding the circumstances in which an order might be made under s 356 of the Act that any penalty imposed upon any one or more of the Respondents be paid to the Employment Advocate ( McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 828). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2006] FCA 994">On 20 January 2006, I published reasons in relation to particular matters arising out of a consideration of the factual and legal issues in the matter consequent upon a trial of the action in which extensive argument occurred in relation to a 'no case' to answer submission made by the respondents. That submission was made on the footing that the respondents were put to an election not to call evidence in the proceeding as a condition of making the 'no case' submission. In dealing with the matter, I reviewed all of the evidence and the issues with a view to ultimately making final dispositive orders subject to further submissions on particular matters before making any orders. See generally McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 828 at [82] --- [92] and [370] --- [382]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2006] FCA 907">3 As a result of the determination of those matters, an application was made by Northern Co-operative Meat Company Limited ("NCMCL") for an order that the costs incurred in resisting the application made against it pursuant to order 27A, rule 2 for leave to issue a subpoena calling for the production of five classes of documents described at paragraph 6 of the reasons of 2 September 2005, be paid by the applicant respondents. These reasons deal with the resolution of the application for the order for costs incurred by NCMCL. Reasons for judgment in the proceeding consequent upon the trial of the proceeding were published on 30 June 2006: McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 828. </sentence>
