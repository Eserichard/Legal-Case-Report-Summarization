<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 8">
 The motion before the primary judge for disqualification 
 
 Cadbury brought on a motion seeking an order that the primary judge disqualify himself from further hearing the matter on the ground of apprehended bias. The application was dismissed ( Cadbury Schweppes v Darrell Lea (No. 5) [2007] FCA 1245 ; (2008) 240 ALR 780 (the disqualification ruling)). Cadbury contends in this appeal that the primary judge made evident in his reasons for refusing to disqualify himself that he had been reinforced to a considerable degree in his original evidence ruling by observations of the Full Court and thus the primary judge has not embraced the correction of his earlier error in an unqualified way. It is therefore necessary to examine the primary judge's reasons for refusing disqualification, a little closely. The appellant then applied to the primary judge for an order that he disqualify himself from hearing the proceeding on the ground of apprehended bias. The application was based on certain observations and conclusions of the primary judge in the evidence ruling and the primary judge's findings of fact and conclusions in the substantive judgment. The primary judge refused the application and delivered reasons for his decision: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 5) [2007] FCA 1245 ; (2007) 240 ALR 780. I will refer to these reasons as the disqualification reasons. 
 The appellant's application and the decision on the application 
 
 In its application, the appellant claimed that it had a substantial and valuable reputation and goodwill in Australia in the colour Cadbury purple .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1172">4 The matters that are now the subject of Part 1 of this appeal were first raised by way of motion to the primary judge on 2 August 2007. This motion was dismissed: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 5) [2007] FCA 1245 ; (2007) 240 ALR 780. Leave to appeal against the dismissal of the motion was granted on 28 August 2007 but was subsequently revoked by a Full Court (of which I was a member) on 2 November 2007: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 210. </sentence>
