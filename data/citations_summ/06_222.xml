<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] ACTSC 2">Finally, I refer to what Collier J said in Visionmax Pty Ltd v Budget Specs (Franchising) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 222 where her Honour observed (at [13]): 
 
 
 Order 11 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules states that a pleading of a party shall only contain in a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party relies, but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved ( Blake v Albion Life Assurance Society (1876) 45 LJQB 663 at 667 per Brett J and North Western Salt Co Ltd v Electrolytic Alkali Co Ltd [1913] 3 KB 422 at 425.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 728">As set out at [18] above, after the statement of claim was filed and served the respondent's solicitors requested further and better particulars. I am satisfied that this was the correct approach and I am guided by the judgment of Collier J in Visionmax Pty Ltd v Budget Specs (Franchising) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 222 at [7] : RELEVANT LEGAL PRINCIPLES Further and Better Particulars, compared with Interrogatories [7] The essential function of particulars is to 'carry into operation the overriding principle that the litigation between the parties, and particularly the trial, should be conducted fairly, openly and without surprises and incidentally to save costs'. (Atkin's Encyclopaedia of Court Forms and Precedents in Civil Proceedings, Butterworths, vol 8, p 31). Particulars complete the picture of the applicant's cause of action with information sufficiently detailed to put the respondent on guard as to the case it has to meet and to enable it to prepare for trial (Spedding v Fitzpatrick (1888) 38 Ch D 410 ; R v Associated Northern Collieries [1910] HCA 61 ; (1910) 11 CLR 738 at 741; Goldsmith v Sandilands [2002] HCA 31 ; (2002) 190 ALR 370 at 371; King v AG Australia Holdings Ltd (formerly GIO Australia Holdings Ltd) [2003] FCA 543 at paras 16---18). A request for further and better particulars should be made initially by letter, however the Court may order further and better particulars to be provided pursuant to O 12 Federal Court Rules . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] VCAT 1100">The difference between a Request for Further and Better Particulars and an Interrogatory is obvious. It should be very clear to all concerned that any Request should not be served in Interrogatory form. A request is served to "clarify" a case and not to do more in an argument ....................: see Visionmax Pty Ltd v Budget Specs (Franchising) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 222 at [7] --- [8] ..... Collier J. Seldom in any event will a Request seeking "the usual particulars" or "the usual details" be allowed, I should add. (c) The Applicant nonetheless should not have provided particulars in response in Requests in the way it chose to do so.</sentence>
