<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 485">The discovery that is now sought from each party by the other, follows findings of the respondent's ('Telstra's') liability for breach of provisions of the Access Agreement to which the applicant ('Optus') and Telstra are parties ([2009] FCA 422 and [2009] FCA 728) and for breach of Telstra's duty of confidence to Optus ([2010] FCAFC 21). On 21 November 2007 I ordered that certain issues be reserved for separate and later determination pursuant to O 29 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules (Cth) ('Rules'). The discovery now sought concerns those reserved issues --- Optus' entitlement to relief, the quantum of any pecuniary relief, including the extent of Telstra's use of confidential information by the preparation and distribution of market share reports to officers of Telstra for certain specific purposes. </sentence>

(b) [Telstra] breached clause 15.2 of the Access Agreement by:

 (ii) insofar as the Market Share Reports contain Traffic Information, being Confidential Information or Communication Information of [Optus] ..., distributing the Market Share Reports among [Telstra's] personnel; and
