<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] APO 36">These matters were heard together by Lindgren J and a single decision issued Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 (24 April 2008). The key findings of his decision were as follows: The judge accepted that the separation of Escitalopram from its racemic mixture was a difficult process and required inventive effort to achieve. All the claims of the LEXAPRO patent were therefore found to be valid apart from claim 5 which failed for want of utility. However, as CIPRAMIL necessarily contains S-(+) enantiomer (escitalopram) as part of the racemic mixture, the registration of CIPRAMIL on (9 December 1997) was the first inclusion on the ARTG for the purposes of section 70 and 71 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) [see para 533-543]. Justice Lindgren therefore dismissed Lundbeck's appeal in relation to NSD 1078 of 2006 and ordered that the Register should be rectified by omission from it of any reference to an extension of term of the patent [as per para 544].  A chronology of events has been generally described in the background to this decision. The table below provides a summary of the key dates and events prior to the current hearing.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1061">In Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 ; (2008) 76 IPR 618 Lindgren J addressed the question of the circumstances in which information in a document is part of common general knowledge. He said (at 667) [221]: 
 
 "As noted earlier, it was held in Astra that information recorded in a document, even a document widely circulated within the art, is not part of general common knowledge merely because the skilled addressee could be expected to locate it. The question is whether it is 'generally accepted without question' or 'generally regarded as a good basis for further action' by the bulk of those in the art: Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co v Tyco Electronics Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 315 ; (2002) 56 IPR 248 at [100] , quoting Blanco White TA, Patents for Inventions and the Protection of Industrial Design (5 th ed, Stephens, London, 1983) at [4-207].

56 Consequently, the respondent's report of his history as set out in the clinical psychologist's report was not only evidence identifying the matters upon which she relied in forming her opinion but also evidence of the truth of those matters: Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 at [761] - [783] per Lindgren J. Section 136 of the Evidence Act permits a court to limit the use to which such evidence may be put but no such order was sought by the Minister from the learned Federal Magistrate and, in fact, no such order was made. It follows that the respondent's reports of his symptoms as set out in the clinical psychologist's report were evidence that he did in fact suffer from those symptoms.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 1393">In his text Patents for Inventions (5 th ed, Stevens, 1983) Blanco White said (at 4-102) (p 53): 
 
 The test for lack of novelty is essentially the same as the test for infringement; that is to say, a prior use will invalidate a claim ... if it was such that it would infringe that claim if carried out after the grant of the patent concerned; while a prior disclosure will invalidate if it contains a clear description of, or clear instructions to do or make, something that would infringe if carried out after grant. 
 

 
This formulation has been applied in Australia (see Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 ; (2008) 76 IPR 618 at [157] (p 657) (per Lindgren J)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] APO 31">Ms Irani submitted that this would not be achieved if the term of the extension was reckoned using a product sponsored by a competitor. Specifically, an extension based on AGENERASE would be approximately two years shorter than an extension based on PREZISTA. In this regard I also note the comment by Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 at [23] , [2008] FCA 559 ; 76 IPR 618 at 630 ( Alphapharm ):
 
"This provision reflects the view that, ordinarily, ARTG registration should mark the beginning of exploitation. "
 
 
While I understand Ms Irani's concern about detriment to the patentee, Pfizer (No 2) is clear on the point and the term of the extension is based on the earliest inclusion, regardless of the identity of the sponsor. It is not open to the Commissioner to calculate the term of the extension only on the basis of goods sponsored by the patentee. I will return to this point in my conclusion. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCAFC 182">40 In Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 ; (2008) 76 IPR 618 at [761] - [772], Lindgren J considered the interaction of ss 59 and 60 of the Evidence Act , in the context of expert opinions. In Alphapharm , Lindgren J held that the representations made by the authors of the articles cited by an expert, Professor Montgomery, were "'previous representations' as to the carrying out of the clinical studies and the results of them": see Alphapharm 76 IPR at [769]. His Honour also held, however, that the intent and effect of ss 59 and 60 of the Evidence Act was that "statements of the bases for expert opinions like those made by Professor Montgomery were to be characterised as being relevant for a purpose other than proof of the facts intended to be asserted by the representations by the authors of the articles": Alphapharm 76 IPR at [770]. We agree with Lindgren J's explication of the interaction of ss 59 and 60 in the context of expert opinions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1498">Rather, they were concerned with the question of anticipation, and in some respects applied the "reverse infringement" test for novelty. The cross-respondent submitted that the authorities in this line are relevant because, if a compound disclosed in a prior publication did not anticipate the patent, it would not infringe the patent if produced after grant. In Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 , it was contended that an invention which consisted of a purified enantiomer had been anticipated by an earlier patent which made no reference to individual enantiomers. Lindgren J said (at [171]):
 
The Australian Citalopram Patent did not refer to "enantiomers". It did not expressly or by implication otherwise disclose the individual enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1364">331 Branson J in Quick v Stoland explained in detail the legislative rationale for this position, and Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 summarised in detail the historical background including the Australian Law Reform Commission's Interim Report on Evidence (ALRC No 26, 1985). It is unnecessary to repeat the reasoning of their Honours here.
  336 Finally, in relation to packout rates and validation of the data in the DPI publication, this is not a situation where Mr Frick is relying on data in, for example, peer-reviewed journal articles and texts (cf discussion in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 at [779] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCAFC 157">95 Judgment was delivered in Bodney [2008] FCAFC 63 ; 167 FCR 84 on 23 April 2008. The following day, Lindgren J delivered judgment in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 in which his Honour addressed an objection to the admissibility of expert evidence of an eminent psychiatrist of clinical studies and the results that had been reported in reputable journals but which the witness had not himself carried out. His Honour discussed, inter alia, Borowski v Quayle [1966] VR 382, s 60 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and the Australian Law Reform Commission's reviews of the law of evidence referred to in the above passage. His Honour arrived at a conclusion that was in line with that which had been reached by the Full Court the preceding day in Bodney [2008] FCAFC 63 ; 167 FCR 84. Both cases were, of course, concerned with the admissibility of expert evidence in judicial proceedings. Mr Hagen's report did not fall for consideration by reference to questions of admissibility that would arise on a trial of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 1194">67 Lindgren J dealt with a somewhat similar situation in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 although, in that case, there was no express reference to, or claim to, the enantiomers of the racemate in the alleged anticipation. His Honour had construed the relevant claims of the patent in suit as relating only to the (+)- or dextro-rotatory enantiomer of citalopram, having a separate existence, not being an indistinguishable part of the unresolved racemate. His reasoning included the following ( Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 at [118] ---[119]):
 "The only context that I take into account in arriving at this conclusion is that it was part of common general knowledge: 
 
 &#8226; that racemates contained in equal parts (+) and (---) enantiomers;
 &#8226; that the enantiomers of a racemate were potentially separable, and it was a possibility that an enantiomer might have a stable existence as a compound distinct from being part of the racemate;
 &#8226; that some racemates had in fact been resolved into their separate enantiomers; and
 &#8226; that racemates were commonly represented by the symbol (+/-) to indicate the presence of both enantiomers. 
 
 It is not that the (+)-citalopram compound does not exist when it is part of the racemate. The skilled addressee would understand that it exists whether a part of the racemate or apart from it, and that the purpose of the (+) symbol is only to distinguish it from the (---)-enantiomer and from its being merely part of the racemate or of some other mixture. The (+) or (---) symbol, devoid of any context suggesting otherwise, implies distinctness from the racemate. " 
In Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 , Professor Martin Banwell was called by the applicant for revocation, as he was in these cases.  68 After referring to the well-known passage from General Tire &amp; Rubber Co [1972] RPC 457 at 485---486 and citing various other cases, his Honour said ( Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 at [161] ):
 "What does "enabling disclosure" mean in the context of a product claim? It means that the earlier disclosure must point unmistakeably to the (+)-enantiomer of citalopram, as distinct from the racemate, as a drug desirable to obtain. " 
I take "as distinct from" to mean "separately from" not "instead of" or "as opposed to". This does not include any separate requirement of enablement in accordance with SmithKline Beecham (Paroxetine Methanesulfonate) Patent [2006] RPC 323 and is consistent with my opinion.  73 Although the decisions in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 and Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 turned in large measure upon the evidence in each case, a difference in approach can be detected on the question involving the disclosure of enantiomers, with Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 favourable to the applicants on this issue, and Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 being neutral. In neither case was there the express reference to enantiomers such as there is in the French and corresponding patents here. The priority dates of the relevant patents are also interesting when compared with the priority dates in issue here. In Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 , the priority date of the broader patent was 30 May 1986 and that of the enantiomer patent 21 July 1989. In the case of Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 the Australian Citalopram Patent had a priority date of 14 January 1976 and the enantiomer patent 14 June 1988. The common general knowledge found by Lindgren J to relate to the enantiomer patent and by Young J to relate to the broader patent was very much in the same time band as that relevant to construction of the patent in suit here. Naturally, the field of each invention is somewhat different but the principles of stereochemistry as they were understood at the time should not have varied much. There is no suggestion of any crucial and widely known developments during the years in question.  67 Lindgren J dealt with a somewhat similar situation in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 although, in that case, there was no express reference to, or claim to, the enantiomers of the racemate in the alleged anticipation. His Honour had construed the relevant claims of the patent in suit as relating only to the (+)- or dextro-rotatory enantiomer of citalopram, having a separate existence, not being an indistinguishable part of the unresolved racemate. His reasoning included the following ( Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 at [118] ---[119]):
 "The only context that I take into account in arriving at this conclusion is that it was part of common general knowledge: 
 
 &#8226; that racemates contained in equal parts (+) and (---) enantiomers;

The (+) or (---) symbol, devoid of any context suggesting otherwise, implies distinctness from the racemate. " 
In Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 , Professor Martin Banwell was called by the applicant for revocation, as he was in these cases.  49 Counsel for Sanofi-Aventis submitted that enabling disclosure, not mere disclosure, is required for anticipation, citing, most recently, Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 559 at [160] ---[161] and the decision of the House of Lords in SmithKline Beecham (Paroxetine Methanesulfonate) Patent [2006] RPC 323. By way of introduction, it is worth remarking that the phrase "enabling disclosure" was brought to prominence by the speech of Lord Hoffmann in Biogen Inc v Medeva plc [1996] UKHL 18 ; [1997] RPC 1 , (1996) 36 IPR 438. That decision concerned the requirements for a valid patent under the 1997 United Kingdom Act (based upon the European Patent Convention) but did not concern the question of anticipation. 70 A little earlier than the decision in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 , Young J had considered a similar issue in Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner-Lambert Co LLC (No 2) [2006] FCA 1787 , (2006) 71 IPR 46. One question was whether the formula in claim 1 of the relevant patent claimed only the racemate and not the enantiomers separate from the racemate. The patentee, Warner-Lambert, called, amongst other witnesses, Professor Christopher Easton and Professor Peter Scammells, who gave evidence for Sanofi-Aventis in these cases. 67 Lindgren J dealt with a somewhat similar situation in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 although, in that case, there was no express reference to, or claim to, the enantiomers of the racemate in the alleged anticipation. His Honour had construed the relevant claims of the patent in suit as relating only to the (+)- or dextro-rotatory enantiomer of citalopram, having a separate existence, not being an indistinguishable part of the unresolved racemate. His reasoning included the following ( Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 at [118] ---[119]):

In Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 , Professor Martin Banwell was called by the applicant for revocation, as he was in these cases.  69 It was alleged that the product claims of the patent in suit in that case were anticipated by the Australian Citalopram Patent. His Honour rejected the argument on the following basis ( Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 559 at [171] ---[173]):
 "The Australian Citalopram Patent did not refer to "enantiomers". It did not expressly or by implication otherwise disclose the individual enantiomers. It disclosed the racemate and enabled the obtaining of it. 1 The present cases are applications for revocation of a patent pursuant to s 138(3) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) (the 1990 Act). The patent claims an enantiomer of a racemate where that racemate was disclosed and claimed by an earlier patent. This has been an issue in relation to other compounds, most recently in two judgments published after the close of evidence and, in one case, after the close of addresses --- the decision of Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 and the decision of the Full Court in Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner-Lambert Co LLC [2008] FCAFC 82 respectively.  73 Although the decisions in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 and Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 turned in large measure upon the evidence in each case, a difference in approach can be detected on the question involving the disclosure of enantiomers, with Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 favourable to the applicants on this issue, and Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 being neutral.

In Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 , the priority date of the broader patent was 30 May 1986 and that of the enantiomer patent 21 July 1989. In the case of Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 the Australian Citalopram Patent had a priority date of 14 January 1976 and the enantiomer patent 14 June 1988. The common general knowledge found by Lindgren J to relate to the enantiomer patent and by Young J to relate to the broader patent was very much in the same time band as that relevant to construction of the patent in suit here. Naturally, the field of each invention is somewhat different but the principles of stereochemistry as they were understood at the time should not have varied much. There is no suggestion of any crucial and widely known developments during the years in question. </sentence>
