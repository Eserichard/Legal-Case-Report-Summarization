<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] AATA 962">There have been two recent judgments of the Federal Court and in which relief has been granted to the taxpayers concerned; I refer in this context to Commissioner of Taxation v A Taxpayer [2006] FCA 888 and Commissioner of Taxation v Milne [2006] FCA 1005. In each of those cases the taxpayer was able to establish both serious hardship coupled with the fact that the hardship arose from misfortune for which he was not responsible. (Milne in fact is the solicitor to the Applicant in this matter). Both cases are in my view distinguishable since in this case the hardship was in fact attributable to the conduct of the Applicant himself. </sentence>
