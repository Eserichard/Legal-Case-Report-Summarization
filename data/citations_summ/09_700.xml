<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 530">Courts exercising the current jurisdiction have identified numerous factors that may be relevant in assessing the appropriate penalty: see, for example, Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 at 228-229 [120] - [123]; Comcare v Commonwealth [2009] FCA 700 ; (2009) 184 IR 441 at 461 [71] ; Comcare v John Holland Rail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 771 ; [2009] FCA 771 ; (2009) 188 IR 415 at 428-429 [136] - [142]; Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 ; (2007) 98 ALD 67 at 68-69 [5] - [7]; and Linfox at 168 [40]. Compare too DPP v Amcor Packaging Australia Pty Ltd [2005] VSCA 219 ; (2005) 11 VR 557 at 565 [35] . To quote Flick J in Post Logistics at 585-8 [32]-[39]: 
 
 [32] In the statutory context of the present legislation, Madgwick J has focussed attention upon those considerations relevant to the imposition of a penalty in Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 ; (2007) 163 FCR 207 ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1220">Ultimately Madgwick J expressed the view, at [121], that the overriding principle is that the pecuniary penalty should reflect the Court's view of the seriousness of the offending conduct; see also Coochey v Commonwealth of Australia [2005] FCA 1165 ; (2005) 149 FCR 312 at [73] . A similar approach was taken by North J in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 700 ; (2009) 184 IR 441 ; 110 ALD 252 and Barker J in Comcare v John Holland Rail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 771 ; (2009) 188 IR 415 at [137] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 793">The view taken by Madgwick J in that case (at [125]) was that the maximum penalty would be appropriate where there had been a 'conscious decision to flout the law'. That approach was followed by North J in Comcare v Commonwealth [2009] FCA 700 ; (2009) 184 IR 441 (at [69]-[71]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 459">Judgment was delivered in this proceeding on 30 June 2009 (see Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 700). Paragraph 3 of orders made by consent on that day provided that the amended application, so far as it related to the Lost Section issue, stood adjourned until 1 April 2010. The circumstances in which the order was made are outlined at [110] - [112] of those reasons for judgment as follows: 
 
 110 The Court is asked to adjourn for one year that part of the proceeding which relates to the Lost Section issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1196">I consider that in the context of these particular proceedings this material would be of some assistance in understanding the background to these proceedings: cf North J in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 700.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 771">In Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 700 , North J at [69] --- [71] accepted and adopted the approach to assessing the penalty suggested by Madgwick J in this case.  The maximum pecuniary penalty that might be imposed in this case is equivalent to $242,000.00. I note that in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 662 a penalty of $198,000.00 was imposed. In Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 , a pecuniary penalty of $20,000.00 was imposed. In Comcare v Postal Logistics Australasia Pty Limited [2008] FCA 1987 ; (2008) 178 IR 200 a pecuniary penalty of $165,000.00 was imposed. In Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 700 , a pecuniary penalty of $210,000.00 was imposed. Save in the National Gallery case, which was a minor matter on any view, the other three pecuniary penalties were imposed where the consequences of contravention were the death of an employee. </sentence>
