<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWSC 1465">3 The relevant principles concerning such an application were conveniently summarised by Finn J in Metcash Trading Ltd v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 at [9] , in terms that have been applied in this court on several occasions (for example, by Barrett J in ASIC v Matthews [2009] NSWSC 77 at [5] ):
 
 
 " First , the order alleged to be breached must be clear and unambiguous: see Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 515-516; and be capable of being complied with: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609 at [40] . Secondly , the proper construction of an order is not a matter of fact but a question of law: Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Networks Ltd [2006] FCAFC 41 ; (2006) 150 FCR 110 at [19] . Thirdly , it is not necessary for an applicant to prove that an alleged contemnor intended to disobey the order: ibid, at [17]; nor is it necessary to prove that the alleged contemnor understood the true meaning of the terms of an order or that he or she was aware that his or her conduct constituted a breach of the order: Microsoft Corporation v Marks (No 1) (1996) 65 FCR 117 at 143.

Fourthly , deliberate conduct which is in breach of a court order will constitute wilful disobedience of the order, and therefore a civil contempt, unless the conduct be casual, accidental or unintentional: Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at [6] .

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] VSC 349">(d) The discretion will be exercised more readily after judgment. [32] 
 
 36 The above principles have, in broad terms, also been applied in relation to mandatory injunctions requiring parties to do acts with an overseas element. [33] 
 
 Nature of acts that a Mareva order can restrain or compel 
 
 37 The essence of a Mareva order is the preservation of the defendant's assets pending the hearing and determination of the proceeding against the defendant. The order is not intended to provide security for any judgment that the plaintiff may obtain against the defendant. Rather, it prevents the defendant from dissipating assets and taking them beyond the reach of the jurisdiction of the Court to satisfy any judgment that may be awarded to the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWCA 155">16 His Honour relevantly commenced his discussion of the issues by stating (at [5]) that the applicable legal principles had been " usefully and succinctly stated " in the recent judgment of Finn J in Metcash Trading Ltd v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 at [9] in the following terms:

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCAFC 112">16 On 28 November, Tracey J, in proceedings 1607 of 2005 ([2007] FCA 1814), said:
 1 On 7 November 2007, I found that Mr Siminton had committed eight contempts of Court involving contraventions of an order made by Gray J on 10 January 2006: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609. ... 2 Gray J's order restrained Mr Siminton from dealing with, withdrawing or disposing of moneys held in various accounts. The contempts were committed when Mr Siminton either caused the funds to be transferred from such accounts into an account held by a Mr &amp; Mrs Holzheimer in the Bank of Adelaide or he withdrew transferred funds from Holzheimer's account.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCAFC 89">30 Although the appellant conceded that he might, once the funds were in Australia, have applied them to pay part of the fine imposed by the Full Court, the question for determination, was whether, as the appellant asserted, he had the right to do so, or otherwise use them as he pleased, because they were not subject to the orders made by Gray J. The correct view is, as the primary judge held in the judgment here under appeal (at [33]), that the funds upon which the concession was based were subject to the orders of Gray J and that the appellant 'should not, therefore, have dealt with those moneys'. More specifically, to do so was, as the primary judge himself correctly found in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609 ( Siminton No 7 ) a contempt of the orders of Gray J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCAFC 90">1 On 7 November 2007, a judge of this Court (Tracey J) in proceedings VID 1607 of 2005, found that eight specified Charges of contempt of court brought by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority against David Robert Siminton (the appellant) had been established beyond reasonable doubt: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1815">5 Mr Siminton relied on the same evidence and submissions which were advanced during the penalty hearing conducted in relation to the contempt findings which I made in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 10) [2007] FCA 1814 at [9] and [11]. This was character evidence given by two of his friends and submissions that he was impecunious but that an unnamed person might be prepared to provide him with some money to pay any fine which the Court might impose.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCA 1814">1 On 7 November 2007 I found that Mr Siminton had committed eight contempts of Court involving contraventions of an order made by Gray J on 10 January 2006: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 7) [2007] FCA 1609.

 22. Siminton's attempts to conceal his use of funds, and his failure to complete a statement of affairs or provide books of account leads readily to an inference that Siminton has access to the funds in the account in the name of Holzheimer. ..."
