<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 881">43 If an Australian protective provision would be avoided by forcing an applicant to sue in the courts of nominated jurisdiction, that is an important factor which should overcome the pre-disposition of the court to refuse to accept jurisdiction: Commonwealth Bank of Australia v White [1999] VSC 262 ; [1999] 2 VR 681 , 704-705, [87]-[91]; Quinlan v Safe International Forsakrings AB [2005] FCA 1362 , [49]; Hume Computers Pty Ltd v Exact International BV [2006] FCA 1440 , [21]-[26]; see also [2006] FCA 1439 , [35]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 478">1 On 16 October 2006 I gave judgment in favour of the applicants ("the Hume Companies") for an interlocutory injunction to restrain certain of the respondents from soliciting the applicants' customers; [2006] FCA 1439.  5 There is evidence before me that the letter was delivered by hand to the offices of the solicitors on 22 December 2006. Notwithstanding this, and in spite of the commercial imperative to bring the Distributorship Agreement to an end (see [2006] FCA 1439 at [32] ), the Hume companies contend that the letter was not a valid notice of termination. 12 If these questions are determined adversely to the Hume companies, they contend that a condition should be imposed on the discharge of the injunctions and release of the undertakings. The proposed condition is that Exact is to pay the compensation due under Article 21; see [2006] FCA 1439 at [12] .
