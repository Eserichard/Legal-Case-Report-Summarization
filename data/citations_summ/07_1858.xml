<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1703">The second ground of application was that the Tribunal failed to notify the applicant in writing of the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision. In SZIOF v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1858 Collier J gave a summary of what did and did not constitute information: "28 The term "information" within s 424A(1) was considered by the Full Court in VAF 206 ALR at 476 and defined by Finn and Stone JJ in that case to refer to: "...knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the Tribunal: Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 at [3] , irrespective of whether it is reliable or has a sound factual basis: Win v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 56 ; (2001) 105 FCR 212 at [19] --- [22]. " 29 The factual basis of "information" was reiterated by the majority of the High Court in SZBYR 235 ALR 616 whether their Honours said in relation to "information" in s.424A(1): 
 "However broadly, information be defined, it's meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation not the existence of doubts inconsistencies or the absence of evidence. ""

On 28 November 2007, the Honourable Justice Collier dismissed the applicant's appeal [2] .

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 3">It was noted that it was not disputed that it was well established that independent country information was within the exception of s.424A(3)(a) (see VHAP ). Consistent with the reasoning in VHAP it was said that the mere fact that the applicant was a member of SUNCA or MPP, that the Tribunal sent an email to the MPP, that the MPP did not reply and that the Tribunal used that lack of reply in reaching its conclusion, did not mean that the exemption did not apply (Also see NAMW at [64] to [71], WAJW at [43] --- [46], QAAC at [20] --- [22] and VJAF at [13] --- [15]). It was reiterated that the reference to a class of persons in the subparagraph was not another criterion to be met.
