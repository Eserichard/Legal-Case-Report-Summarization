<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 146">The validity of the designs was unsuccessfully attacked on the same basic grounds in 2008: LED Technologies Pty Ltd v Elecspess Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1941 ; (2008) 80 IPR 85 , affirmed Keller v LED Technologies Pty Ltd [2010] FCAFC 55 ; (2010) 185 FCR 449. Many of the arguments raised here are similar to those considered by the court in the earlier action. The respondents are able to relitigate the validity issue because on lack of novelty they rely on additional prior art and on a lack of clarity they raise different points of construction. It is, to say the least, extraordinarily expensive for the parties, as well as being time consuming for the court, to have to hear and determine issues that might have been determined once and for all.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 160">Her Honour said that, unsurprisingly, the number of products sold did not coincide, and that the discrepancy could not be resolved on the evidence before the Court. Her Honour did not consider that it would be a useful expenditure of the Court's time to seek to arrive at a precise number, but considered that the better approach was to assess damages, even though such quantification necessarily involved a degree of speculation and guesswork. Her Honour said ([2008] FCA 1941 at [101]): 
 
 Applying that approach, I consider that it is fair, based on the evidence to which I have referred, to assess damages at the amount contended for by the Respondents, rounded up to $200,000.00. I do so for a number of reasons. First, the figures in the table at [98] were submitted by the Respondents on the basis that the sum of $193,045 was the "limit (maximum) of the ... monetary relief as far as the evidence permits.</sentence>

The primary judge delivered two sets of reasons. The first set of reasons deals with her principal conclusions: LED Technologies Pty Ltd v Elecspess Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1941 ("principal reasons"). The second set of reasons deals with the orders sought by the parties: LED Technologies Pty Ltd v Elecspess Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 141 ("final reasons"). In what follows I refer, for the most part, to the principal reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1437">Notwithstanding the acknowledgment that there are these two distinct lines of authority, the Full Court has suggested that the differences may be more apparent than real. In Allen Manufacturing Co Pty Ltd v McCallum &amp; Co Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1838 , 53 IPR 400 Wilcox, French and Dowsett JJ concluded: 
 
 [43] The difference between the two tests may be more apparent than read [sic]. We are not aware of any case in which it has been held that a director or officer of a company directed or procured the company's infringing act, yet that person escaped liability because he or she did not deliberately, wilfully or knowingly pursue a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement or that reflected indifference to the risk of infringement. This may be because, in practice, an act of direction or procurement will generally meet the Mentmore test. It is notable that, in Mentmore itself, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal declined (at 204) to "go so far as to hold that the director or officer must know or have reason to know that the acts which he directs or procures constitute infringement". The court declined to do this because that "would be to impose a condition of liability that does not exist for patent infringement generally". 
 

 
The same conclusion was reached by Gordon J in LED Technologies Pty Ltd v Elecspess Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1941 at [171] to [175] [2008] FCA 1941 ; , 80 IPR 85 at 128 to 129. </sentence>
