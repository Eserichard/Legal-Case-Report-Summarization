<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 457">The applicable principles are not in dispute. The Court's discretion to order costs under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the FCA ) is at large and ought not be read down otherwise than in accordance with accepted principle: Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [3] . Costs ordinarily follow the event. An order for costs is intended to compensate the successful party, not to punish the unsuccessful party: Demetriou v Gusdote Pty Ltd (ACN 089 937 253) [2010] FCA 581 ; (2010) 78 ACSR 566 at 576, referring to Brennan CJ in Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at 75. Fairness should dictate how the discretion is exercised: Bowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCAFC 107 at [5] . Departure from the usual rule generally requires a valid special reason: Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 55">434 In the course of her reasons for judgment delivered on 18 December 2008, the primary Judge said that, during the course of the hearing before her, LED Technologies stated that it no longer sought relief against Mr Morrison. In final orders made on 24 February 2009, her Honour ordered that LED Technologies' claims against Mr Morrison be dismissed, and that it pay Mr Morrison's costs of those claims incurred after 10 April 2008. In her Honour's reasons given that day, the only reference to Mr Morrison's costs was the following:
 In relation to para 5 of the Orders, I have not awarded costs to the Fifth Respondent on an indemnity basis. Not only was the application not actively pursued at the hearing, I do not consider that the Fifth Respondent has established any basis for costs to be awarded on an indemnity basis: see Colgate-Palmolive Company and Another v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234 per Sheppard J; Bagshaw v Scott [2005] FCA 104 at [39] - [43] per Bennett J; Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (formerly known as Citicorp Australia Ltd) (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] per Finn J; Ruaro v Ferrari [2008] FCA 307 at [17] per Emmett J; Tadros v J &amp; R Investment Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 832 [13]-[16] per Buchanan J. Otherwise, her Honour contented herself with saying that the costs orders which she proposed to make (which included the order relating to Mr Morrison's costs) "deal with the issues of costs on the claim, the cross claims and the costs of those cross claims in the most appropriate manner". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 141">In relation to para 5 of the Orders, I have not awarded costs to the Fifth Respondent on an indemnity basis. Not only was the application not actively pursued at the hearing, I do not consider that the Fifth Respondent has established any basis for costs to be awarded on an indemnity basis: see Colgate-Palmolive Company and Another v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234 per Sheppard J; Bagshaw v Scott [2005] FCA 104 at [39] - [43] per Bennett J; Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (formerly known as Citicorp Australia Ltd) (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] per Finn J; Ruaro v Ferrari [2008] FCA 307 at [17] per Emmett J ; Tadros v J &amp; R Investment Services Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 832 [13]-[16] per Buchanan J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 150">The principles in relation to costs are well-established: Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd and Others (No 2 ) (1996) 72 FCR 151 at 152-153 per Black CJ; Ruddock v Vadarlis (2001) 115 FCR 229 at [9]-[18] per Black CJ and French J; Grey v Mango Pre Paid Calling Cards Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 362 at [4] per Nicholson J; Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [3] per Finn J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 35">L &amp; A Maglio Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1365 concerned taxation appeals by several taxpayers against appellable objection decisions. The appeals were compromised and were discontinued by consent, but the respondent sought costs of the appeals. Those costs were ordered in the respondent's favour, having regard to the appellants' conduct of the appeal over a lengthy period: see at [32]. The other decision referred to by counsel for the defendant is equally evidently inapplicable. Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 concerned the award of costs after the applicant's claim had been summarily dismissed. Costs were awarded on a solicitor and client basis against the applicant, having regard to the way the proceedings were conducted. In neither case was there the overlap of the application of O 23 of the Federal Court Rules . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1685">35 Of its nature, a successful application under s 31A will proceed from circumstances that are special or unusual. Where summary judgment is given in all or part of a proceeding, then a conclusion that at least one of the grounds contemplated by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive will ordinarily be open or at least arguable. In Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (formerly known as Citicorp Australia Limited) (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 , Finn J summarily dismissed an application against the various respondents. According to Finn J (at [6]): 
 
 The application was a hopeless one and ought never have been brought in the form it was. The applicant may well have been badly advised. This though provides no excuse for so imposing upon the respondents. 

In the result, Finn J orders that the applicant pay the respondents' costs of the application on a solicitor and client basis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1412">6 The Court's power to award costs is discretionary and is unfettered, except that it must be exercised judicially: s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth); s 1335(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The Court's discretion to order costs pursuant to the power in s 43 is at large, and that section provides a broad and ample power which ought not be read down otherwise than in accordance with accepted principle: Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [3] per Finn J. The purpose of an order for costs is to compensate the successful party, not to punish the unsuccessful one: Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 543 per Mason CJ. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1375">

31 Other cases decided recently in this Court show that these principles are regularly applied: see, e.g., Barrett Property Group Limited v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 (" Barrett ") at [3]-[5] per Gilmour J; Xat Ky v Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd (No 2 ) [2007] FCA 1785 at [12] - [13], [29] per Middleton J; Access for All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] per Collier J; Jainshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 per Besanko J; and Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] - [5] per Finn J. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 629">A costs order is not intended to punish the unsuccessful party but rather to compensate the successful party: Hurst v Education Queensland (No 2) [2005] FCA 793 at [5]. This is so even where the ordinary practice is departed from. The aim is not to punish or deter future litigants but simply to compensate a party fully for costs which normal party-party costs could not be expected to do, where it was unreasonable for that party to be subjected to any expenditure of costs, such as where a hopeless proceeding is brought: Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4]- [5]. Any departure from this general rule requires a special reason: Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] ; Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v Next Publishing Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 971 at [5] . The categories in respect of which departure from the usual rule are contained are not closed: John S Hayes &amp; Associates Pty Limited v [Kimberly-Clark] Australia Pty Limited (1994) 52 FCR [201]; Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [32] .</sentence>

31 This statement of principle was recently cited and followed by Finn J in Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179. Finn J said at [6], inter alia, 'the application was a hopeless one and ought never have been brought in the form it was'. I think that observation applies equally to the case with which I am dealing in this judgment. I can see no basis for the application whether in an unamended or an amended form. Mr Rahman's insistence on pursuing it in an unamended form rendered it, if this was possible, even more hopeless than otherwise. I think that the first and second respondents are entitled to be protected so far as possible, if they seek it, against the unnecessary expenditure of costs which Mr Rahman's application has caused.</sentence>
