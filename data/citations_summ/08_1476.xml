71 The primary judge recognised the ambiguity of cl 2.2(1A) (at [11]), but preferred the construction proffered by the respondent, Phoenix Leisure Group Pty Ltd (Phoenix), and thus held that the words "complete application" in cl 2.2(1A) of the Regulations referred to application 978 filed on 22 November 2006 as a divisional application under s 79B of the Act. Accordingly, the agreed facts did not satisfy the requirements of the prescribed circumstance in s 24(1) of the Act. It followed that Mont's publication and use of the invention from October 2004 (more than 12 months before that date) was not required to be disregarded for the purpose of deciding the issues of novelty and innovative step. The primary judge thus made a declaration and consequential orders dismissing Mont's application and revoking Mont's Australian Innovation Patent No 2006100978 ( Mont Adventure Equipment Pty Limited v Phoenix Leisure Group Pty Limited [2008] FCA 1476). Contrary to the position of Phoenix, Mont does not require leave to appeal because the primary judge's orders dismissing the application and revoking the patent are final orders.</sentence>
