<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 391">In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Contact Plus Group Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 695 ; (2006) 232 ALR 364 at 370-2, Young J held that O 37 had been complied with notwithstanding that the order had not been personally served on the alleged contemnor. In that case the alleged contemnor was represented by counsel when the orders were made, he had previously consented to and signed copies of the relevant orders and shortly after the orders were made was notified by his solicitor of the terms of the orders. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1586">105 The list of factors collected by Merkel J at [25] in Louis Vuitton , including the proposition that other criminal history is irrelevant, has been cited in a number of other cases including Siminton (No 10) [2007] FCA 1814 , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Contract Plus Group Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 695 ; (2006) 232 ALR 364 , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hercules Iron Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1182 and Scott &amp; Ors v Evia Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 15. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 429">87 It is said commonly that the power to impose penalties in cases of civil contempt is to be exercised so as both to ensure that orders are complied with and to deter conduct in contravention of court orders: see e.g. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Contact Plus Group Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 695 at [57] . In the present matter it is the second of these purposes that is of present significance: on this duality in cases of civil contempt see generally Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith on Contempt 3-6 ff. It in turn must be viewed in a context in which the principal proceedings brought by the ACCC was to protect the public interest: see generally Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (1999) 200 CLR 591. </sentence>
