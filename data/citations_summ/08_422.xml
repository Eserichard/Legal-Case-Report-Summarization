<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] AATA 252">The decision of the Federal Court in Comcare v Eames [2008] FCA 422 makes it clear that "disciplinary action" is not restricted to the imposition of a sanction, but may include the process of determining whether there has been a breach of the relevant Code of Conduct including the investigation required to make that determination. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 155">Section 4 of the Act excludes from compensation an injury suffered as a result of reasonable disciplinary action . In Comcare v Eames [2008] FCA 422 , Madgwick J examined the meaning of that phrase in the context of an investigation undertaken in accordance with the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 , regarding a breach of the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct. Madgwick J referred to the decision of Cooper J in Comcare v Chenhall [1992] FCA 353 ; (1992) 37 FCR 75 where he rejected the proposition that disciplinary action refers only to the actual imposition of a sanction. In Eames ' case, Madgwick J held that disciplinary action had begun when the respondent was provided with allegations made against her. I have applied that reasoning to Ms Townsend's case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] AATA 1087">The principles in Chenhall were recently applied by Madgwick J in Comcare v Eames [2008] FCA 422 at [34] and [46]. His Honour held in that case that an investigation of conduct and the reporting of findings to Parliament was disciplinary action even though it was decided not to take any action. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 450">To determine what, if any, action is to be classed as "disciplinary action" it is necessary to consider in detail the documentary provisions establishing the relevant disciplinary process: Commission of Safety and Rehabilitation of Commonwealth Employees v Chenhall [1992] FCA 353 ; (1992) 37 FCR 75 ; Comcare v Eames [2008] FCA 422. </sentence>
