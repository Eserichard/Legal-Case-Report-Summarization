<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1413">However the cases also recognise two related propositions. First, if the criteria for O 35A r 3(2)(c) are satisfied, the Court has a discretion as to whether or not to grant the relief that is claimed: Hills Industries Ltd v Hualin Pty Ltd (2009) 82 IPR 513 ; [2009] FCA 1143 at [11] . Secondly, in exercising that discretion it may be appropriate for the Court to require some evidence by way of proof of the primary allegations, and perhaps on other matters. Whether this is necessary will depend on the particular circumstances of the case including, in particular, the nature of the relief that is sought: Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey t/as DVD Kingdom (2006) 232 ALR 525 ; [2006] FCA 727 at [10] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 492">This is an application for default judgment under O 35A r 3(2) of the Federal Court Rules for loss and damage suffered by the Applicant as a result of allegedly negligent accounting advice it received. It is common ground that under O 35A r 3(2)(c), it is only necessary to establish that on the face of the Statement of Claim there is a claim for the relief sought and that the Court has jurisdiction to grant that relief: Burke v Residential Investments Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 885 at [12] ; Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey t/as DVD Kingdom [2006] FCA 727 ; (2006) 232 ALR 525 at [8] ; Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 433 at [3] . Each of the Respondents was served with these proceedings, with this application for default judgment and with the further amended Statement of Claim filed on 7 May 2010 (the FASC ). No Respondent has taken any step in the proceedings. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 Amended Application and Statement of Claim
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 885">The applicants rely particularly on O 35A r 3(2)(c) of the Rules, which does not require proof by way of evidence of their claim. Instead, on the face of the statement of claim, there must be a claim for the relief sought and the court must have jurisdiction to grant that relief: see Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 433 at [3] per Heerey J; Diesel SPA v Hwang [2005] FCA 1619 at [2] per Tamberlin J; Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 at [57] per Kenny J; and HIT Entertainment Ltd v Lodin [2006] FCA 722 at [5] - [6] per Stone J. Having read the statement of claim, I find that these conditions are satisfied. O 35A r 3 is, nonetheless, discretionary and the circumstances attending the application must be taken into account. In some circumstances, although not here, it is appropriate to exercise some caution before granting relief: see Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey t/as DVD Kingdom [2006] FCA 727 ; (2006) 232 ALR 525 at 527 [10] per Sackville J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1735">15 Sackville J gave consideration to rule 3 in Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey t/as DVD Kingdom [2006] FCA 727 ; (2006) 232 ALR 525 at [8] --- [10]. It is unnecessary to refer to the observations which fell from his Honour in that case, as later authority has established a clear line of approach which should be adopted in relation to matters arising under Order 35A, rule 3(2)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 748">128. In his submissions, the third respondent makes the bold assertion that there is no evidence he attempted to dispose of the second respondent's assets after the summary judgment. [120] Again, this is symptomatic of reluctance on the part of third respondent to concede any issue irrespective of his obligations to sensibly confine the dispute. [121] On his own evidence the third respondent asserts that he disposed of computers belonging to the corporate respondents by dumping them at a public tip. 
 Non-compliance with Mareva orders</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 1417">
 
 8 The applicant's evidence suggests that the seized goods infringed the applicant's trade marks pursuant to Part 12 of the Act. There is no contrary evidence, nor is there any reason to doubt the applicant's evidence. In the absence of any argument that an injunction to restrain future conduct is unnecessary I am satisfied that the evidence supports the relief sought by the applicants; Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey [2006] FCA 727 ; (2006) 232 ALR 525. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 806">1 This judgment concerns a charge of contempt brought against the respondent, Mr Hoey, for breaching orders made by Sackville J on 9 June 2006 ( Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey trading as DVD Kingdom [2006] FCA 727). The proceedings before Sackville J were commenced by application and statement of claim filed on 15 February 2006 (each amended 16 February 2006). </sentence>
