<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 553">Although this occurred under the rubric of a consideration of the primary judge's reasons it was of little assistance in understanding why it was said that the primary judge fell into error. The Court wishes to emphasise that an appeal to the Full Court in a refugee matter should not be taken as an occasion to re-consider the Tribunal's reasons as distinct from considering the primary judge's reasons. 
 

 
These observations have long been applied and followed by subsequent decisions of this Court: eg, SZDJQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 533 at [7] per Bennett J; SZLYI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1809 at [16] per Middleton J; SZMSW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 576 at [19] per Cowdroy J; SZOBH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 776 at [22] per Reeves J. A failure to allege appellable error on the part of the Federal Magistrate " is not a mere matter of form as no original jurisdiction is vested in this Court to review errors perceived to have been committed by the Tribunal ": SZMSZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 877 at [6] . See also: SZJHE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1771 at [7].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 248">The third ground is the assertion that the Tribunal made a wrong conclusion about the applicant's assertions of persecution in Greece and what he describes as "relocation" in Greece. The particulars to this ground appear to cavil with aspects of the Tribunal's factual findings. Whether harm feared by the applicant was for a Convention reason was a question of fact for the Tribunal. [34] As is pointed out by the Minister, there was no issue of relocation of the applicant in Greece. The issue was one of the application of s.36(3) of the Migration Act , given that it was not disputed that the applicant enjoys a right to reside permanently in Greece, and, in the Tribunal's view, Greece is a safe country in which the applicant can reside. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 160">Particular 1(b) which says that: "The failure to consider whether the immediate motivation for the persecution was the real or operative reason" 
is difficult to support when one considers closely the highlighted extracts from [105] found at [4] of these reasons. In my view, the way in which this matter is expressed by the Tribunal indicates that it is making a finding of fact predicated upon its understanding that a person may be motivated to persecute for more than one reason. Fact finding in this way was considered by the Full Bench in Ramirez v Minister for Immigration [2000] FCA 1000 ; (2000) 176 ALR 514 (" Ramirez ") at [36-38] and again at [43]. The Ramirez decision was approved by Bennett J in SZDJQ &amp; SZDJR v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 533 at [38] and [39]. The third particular of Ground one that the Tribunal failed to consider the nexus between the persecution and the reason for it in a common sense way cannot, to my mind, be sustained in the light of the Tribunal's reasoning taken as a whole. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 1354">27. Further, as contended for the first respondent, the Tribunal properly considered whether the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason that was the essential and significant reason for the persecution, as required by s.91R(1)(a). It addressed the correct question having regard to the Convention bases raised on the material before it of political and/or religious reasons. However, based on its consideration of the facts, including the timing of the events and country information in relation to the situation in India, the Tribunal concluded that the harm and harassment directed at the applicant and his family by his neighbour, his men and the local police, was not such that it could be satisfied that it was essentially and significantly for a Convention reason. It was in those circumstances that the Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, (see SZDJQ v MIMA [2006] FCA 533 at [38] ) and no jurisdictional error is apparent in this respect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 802">20 Counsel for the first respondent opposed the appellant being granted leave to raise those two grounds upon appeal as there are no exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of leave to do so, especially as the appellant was represented by counsel before the Federal Magistrate and has not sought to explain why those grounds were not raised before the Federal Magistrate: see Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 190 ALR 543 at [18]; SZDJQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 533 at [32] - [35]. He contended that the appellant should be bound by the conduct of the case before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCAFC 195">19 The Minister objected to the grant of leave to amend the notice of appeal, submitting that there were no 'exceptional circumstances' which would warrant the Court's consideration of the s 424A point: SZDJQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 533. It was also submitted that the appellant had provided no explanation as to why the argument was not raised in the Court below. The argument based on s 424A was fully available to the appellant in the Federal Magistrates Court and, so the Minister said, it should have been raised there.</sentence>
