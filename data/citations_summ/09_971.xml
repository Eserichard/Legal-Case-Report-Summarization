<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 937">I note in particular what was said in this regard in SZMZL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 971 per Graham J (at [5]): "Plainly, satisfaction under s 65(1) is not to be addressed by deciding where the truth lies on the balance of probabilities. Whilst cases such as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 719 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 ('Rajalingam') refer to the 'civil standard of proof' being not irrelevant to the process of fact-finding by the Tribunal and cases such as Kalala v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1594 ; (2001) 114 FCR 212 ('Kalala') refer to the Tribunal being obliged to consider matters on 'a standard less than the balance of probabilities' (see at [25]). I doubt the utility of addressing matters on which the Tribunal has to be 'satisfied' by a standard which is related to the standard of proof required in adversarial civil litigation. " </sentence>
