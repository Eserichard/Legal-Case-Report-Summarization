<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] FCA 1715">1 This afternoon the parties attended an urgent directions hearing in this matter before me. The background to this directions hearing was as follows:
 
&#8226; On 28 September 2006 I ordered that the applications filed in respect of QUD279 of 2004 and QUD389 of 2005 be permanently stayed, except to the extent that the applicants were claiming that the respondent discriminated against each of them pursuant to s 9 and s 15 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) through the payment by the respondent to any manifestation of the Christian Brethren, including the Christian Brethren of Australia Inc of grants for the payment of the applicants' wages that were based on race and resulted in the applicants receiving wages which were at a rate less than that to which they were entitled ( Douglas v State of Queensland [2006] FCA 1288). &#8226; I did not however order a permanent stay of such of the applicants' claims as related to discrimination by the respondent against the applicants in their 'direct' employment with the respondent between 1975 and 1986. Accordingly, a trial date was fixed in respect of that part of the claim in QUD389 of 2005, being 14-16 February 2007 in Mt Isa, and I ordered the applicant to file an amended statement of claim by 30 November 2006. &#8226; The applicants sought leave to appeal from the decision in [2006] FCA 1288. On 5 December 2006 Greenwood J granted leave to appeal in relation to the claim made by the applicants in QUD279 of 2004 and QUD389 of 2005 that the respondent discriminated against each of them in contravention of s 9 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) through the payment by the respondent to any manifestation of the Christian Brethren Church including the Christian Brethren of Australia Inc of grants for the payment of the applicants' wages that were based on race and resulted in the applicants receiving wages which were at a rate less than that to which they were entitled ( Foster v State of Queensland [2006] FCA 1680). I understand that the appeal to the Full Court in this matter will not be heard before the February 2007 Full Court sittings at the earliest. &#8226; Accordingly, I ordered the parties to attend a directions hearing at 4.30 pm this afternoon to make submissions in relation to whether the trial currently listed before me to be heard in Mt Isa on 14-16 February 2007 should proceed.</sentence>
