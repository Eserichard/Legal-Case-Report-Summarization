<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 62">That Act established CASA and prescribed in s 9 its functions, including in part as at 2004 the following: 
 
 CASA's functions 
 (1) CASA has the function of conducting the safety regulation of the following, in accordance with this Act, and the regulations: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) civil air operations in Australian territory; 
 (b) the operation of Australian aircraft outside Australian territory; 
 by means that include the following: 
 (c) developing and promulgating appropriate, clear and concise aviation safety standards; 
 (d) developing effective enforcement strategies to secure compliance with aviation safety standards; 
 (e) issuing certificates, licences, registrations and permits; 
 (f) conducting comprehensive aviation industry surveillance, including assessment of safety-related decisions taken by industry management at all levels for their impact on aviation safety; 
 (g) conducting regular reviews of the system of civil aviation safety in order to monitor the safety performance of the aviation industry, to identify safety-related trends and risk factors and to promote the development and improvement of the system; 
 (h) conducting regular and timely assessment of international safety developments. 
 
 

 
 
 (2) CASA also has the following safety-related functions: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) encouraging a greater acceptance by the aviation industry of its obligation to maintain high standards of aviation safety, through: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) comprehensive safety education and training programs; and 
 (ii) accurate and timely aviation safety advice; and 
 (iii) fostering an awareness in industry management, and within the community generally, of the importance of aviation safety and compliance with relevant legislation; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) promoting full and effective consultation and communication with all interested parties on aviation safety issues. 
 
 

 
In exercising its powers and performing its functions CASA is directed to " regard the safety of air navigation as the most important consideration " (s 9A(1)) and must perform its functions " in a manner consistent with the obligations of Australia under the Chicago Convention " (s 11): cf. Hevi Lift (PNG) Pty Ltd v Civil Aviation Safety Authority (1997) 79 FCR 19 at 21. " There is little doubt ", it has been said, " that the safety of air navigation is the most important consideration under the [Act]" : Repacholi Aviation Pty Ltd v Civil Aviation Safety Authority [2009] FCA 1487 at [33] per McKerracher J. This concern, His Honour there further said " is also reflected under subsidiary provisions ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 994"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 514">The applicants filed an application in this proceeding on 16 September 2009, seeking a declaration that s 47A of the Limitation Act 1935 (WA) did not apply to a proceeding that the applicants proposed to bring against the respondents and, in the alternative, a grant of leave under s 47A(3) of that Act for the applicants to bring the proposed proceeding. On 20 October 2009, the respondents filed a notice of motion in which, amongst other things, they challenged the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the applicants' application. (The motion also contemplated a stay, but the basis for this fell away with the delivery of McKerracher J's judgment in Repacholi Aviation Pty Ltd v Civil Aviation Safety Authority [2009] FCA 1487 ; (2009) 263 ALR 93. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 404">The following discussion is predicated on the assumption that s 47A of the Limitation Act applies to the action that the applicants wish to bring: compare Repacholi Aviation Pty Ltd v Civil Aviation Safety Authority [2009] FCA 1487 ; (2009) 263 ALR 93 (' Repacholi ') at 123 [140]. Under s 47A(3) , the Court may grant leave (with or without conditions) if it thinks it just where it considers that: 
(1) the delay was occasioned by mistake; or
 
(2) the delay was occasioned by any other reasonable cause; or
 
(3) the prospective defendant is not materially prejudiced in its defence or otherwise by the delay. If the Court is satisfied of any of (1), (2) or (3), then the Court may grant leave if it considers it just to do so: see Matheson at 274 [18]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 367">For the reasons stated below, I conclude that the Court has jurisdiction and would dismiss the respondents' motion. The respondents' alternative position that the case be stayed pending delivery of judgment in Federal Court proceeding WAD 51 of 2009 was overtaken by the delivery of judgment: see Repacholi Aviation Pty Ltd v Civil Aviation Safety Authority [2009] FCA 1487 ; (2009) 263 ALR 93 (' Repacholi ').
