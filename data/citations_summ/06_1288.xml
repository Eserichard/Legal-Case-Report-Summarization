<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] FCA 1715">1 This afternoon the parties attended an urgent directions hearing in this matter before me. The background to this directions hearing was as follows:
 
&#8226; On 28 September 2006 I ordered that the applications filed in respect of QUD279 of 2004 and QUD389 of 2005 be permanently stayed, except to the extent that the applicants were claiming that the respondent discriminated against each of them pursuant to s 9 and s 15 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) through the payment by the respondent to any manifestation of the Christian Brethren, including the Christian Brethren of Australia Inc of grants for the payment of the applicants' wages that were based on race and resulted in the applicants receiving wages which were at a rate less than that to which they were entitled ( Douglas v State of Queensland [2006] FCA 1288). &#8226; I did not however order a permanent stay of such of the applicants' claims as related to discrimination by the respondent against the applicants in their 'direct' employment with the respondent between 1975 and 1986. Accordingly, a trial date was fixed in respect of that part of the claim in QUD389 of 2005, being 14-16 February 2007 in Mt Isa, and I ordered the applicant to file an amended statement of claim by 30 November 2006. &#8226; The applicants sought leave to appeal from the decision in [2006] FCA 1288. On 5 December 2006 Greenwood J granted leave to appeal in relation to the claim made by the applicants in QUD279 of 2004 and QUD389 of 2005 that the respondent discriminated against each of them in contravention of s 9 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) through the payment by the respondent to any manifestation of the Christian Brethren Church including the Christian Brethren of Australia Inc of grants for the payment of the applicants' wages that were based on race and resulted in the applicants receiving wages which were at a rate less than that to which they were entitled ( Foster v State of Queensland [2006] FCA 1680). I understand that the appeal to the Full Court in this matter will not be heard before the February 2007 Full Court sittings at the earliest. &#8226; Accordingly, I ordered the parties to attend a directions hearing at 4.30 pm this afternoon to make submissions in relation to whether the trial currently listed before me to be heard in Mt Isa on 14-16 February 2007 should proceed. 6. As today's date is only 7 December 2006, there remains considerable time for the parties to enter into meaningful dialogue or negotiations before the trial takes place in February 2007 should the parties wish. 5 During the hearing, Mr Murdoch drew my attention to the fact that the applicants had failed to file and serve an amended statement of claim by 30 November 2006 as previously ordered by me. Mr Murdoch sought the costs of the respondents of today's hearing to be paid by the applicants, on the basis that the failure of the applicants to file their amended statement of claim meant that the respondents were in an ill-informed position as to whether the trial in Mt Isa should proceed as scheduled, particularly as two of the applicants in QUD389/2005 had not appealed my decision in [2006] FCA 1288. Mr Sprott stated the solicitors for the applicants had been unaware of the need to file the amended statement of claim by 30 November 2006. 6 In deciding this issue I note:
 
&#8226; The result of the decision of Greenwood J in [2006] FCA 1680 meant that it was likely that I would call the parties before me in relation to whether the trial should proceed,
 
however
 
&#8226; I accept the submission of the respondents that the failure of the applicants, for reasons which did not appear to be satisfactory, to file and serve an amended statement of claim as ordered, meant that the respondents were unable to properly evaluate their own position in relation to the trial going forward before me today. I consider of particular importance the fact that two of the applicants in QUD389/2005 have not appealed the decision in respect of the permanent stay. From the respondents' perspective, this obviously raises a question as to which applicants will continue to prosecute this claim; and
 
&#8226; From the perspective of the respondents the failure of the applicant to file and serve an amended statement of claim as previously ordered also meant that it was necessary for the directions hearing to be held in order for the respondents to air their concerns with respect to the amended statement of claim, and for the Court to then be required to rule on the issue of the trial taking place in February 2007. 1 This afternoon the parties attended an urgent directions hearing in this matter before me. The background to this directions hearing was as follows:
 
&#8226; On 28 September 2006 I ordered that the applications filed in respect of QUD279 of 2004 and QUD389 of 2005 be permanently stayed, except to the extent that the applicants were claiming that the respondent discriminated against each of them pursuant to s 9 and s 15 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) through the payment by the respondent to any manifestation of the Christian Brethren, including the Christian Brethren of Australia Inc of grants for the payment of the applicants' wages that were based on race and resulted in the applicants receiving wages which were at a rate less than that to which they were entitled ( Douglas v State of Queensland [2006] FCA 1288). &#8226; I did not however order a permanent stay of such of the applicants' claims as related to discrimination by the respondent against the applicants in their 'direct' employment with the respondent between 1975 and 1986. Accordingly, a trial date was fixed in respect of that part of the claim in QUD389 of 2005, being 14-16 February 2007 in Mt Isa, and I ordered the applicant to file an amended statement of claim by 30 November 2006. &#8226; The applicants sought leave to appeal from the decision in [2006] FCA 1288. On 5 December 2006 Greenwood J granted leave to appeal in relation to the claim made by the applicants in QUD279 of 2004 and QUD389 of 2005 that the respondent discriminated against each of them in contravention of s 9 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) through the payment by the respondent to any manifestation of the Christian Brethren Church including the Christian Brethren of Australia Inc of grants for the payment of the applicants' wages that were based on race and resulted in the applicants receiving wages which were at a rate less than that to which they were entitled ( Foster v State of Queensland [2006] FCA 1680). I understand that the appeal to the Full Court in this matter will not be heard before the February 2007 Full Court sittings at the earliest. &#8226; Accordingly, I ordered the parties to attend a directions hearing at 4.30 pm this afternoon to make submissions in relation to whether the trial currently listed before me to be heard in Mt Isa on 14-16 February 2007 should proceed.</sentence>
