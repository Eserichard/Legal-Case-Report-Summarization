<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1919">14 The " independent country information " would fall within s 424A(3)(a) and, as held by the Federal Magistrate, there would be no breach of s 424A(1). See also SZFQL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1522 and SZCMD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1003 at [20] per Ryan J. Insofar as a complaint is made as to the inadequacy of reasons provided by the Tribunal, it may be noted that the obligation imposed upon the Tribunal is that set forth in s 430(1) of the 1958 Act. That subsection provides as follows:
 
 Where the Tribunal makes its decision on a review, the Tribunal must prepare a written statement that: 
 
 
 (a) sets out the decision of the Tribunal on the review; and
 (b) sets out the reasons for the decision; and
 (c) sets out the findings on any material questions of fact; and
 (d) refers to the evidence or any other material on which the findings of fact were based. 
 

The reasons and decision of the Tribunal have again been reviewed and there is no apparent failure to comply with s 430(1), in particular, s 430(1)(b). The learned Federal Magistrate was of the same conclusion. </sentence>
