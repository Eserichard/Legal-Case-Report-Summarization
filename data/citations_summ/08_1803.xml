<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1403">Federal Magistrate Raphael characterised the gravamen of the appellant's submission as the Tribunal's failure to contact the lawyer even though the appellant had the lawyer's contact details and could have provided them to the Tribunal ( SZNBX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2001] FMCA 103 at [12] ). His Honour considered the obligation of the Tribunal to make enquiries, as discussed in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 by Kenny J and in SZHUH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1893 by Perram J. Federal Magistrate Raphael referred to Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 , which may provide the basis for an argument that in certain circumstances the existence of material which clearly calls for explanation or reconciliation may, as a matter of procedural fairness, generate a duty upon a decision-maker to make further inquiries ( SZHUH at [11] per Perram J). His Honour noted that in SZHUH , Perram J suggested that that principle may not have survived the enactment of s 422B of the Act, notwithstanding later decisions such as Le and SZMCE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 105 ALD 508 ; [2008] FCA 1803. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 703">However, it has been held that those provisions do not impose, generally speaking, any duty upon the Tribunal to make such inquiries. It may be that the decision of Wilcox J in Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 provides the basis for an argument that in certain circumstances the existence of material which clearly calls for explanation or reconciliation may, as a matter of procedural fairness, generate a duty upon a decision-maker to make further inquiries. " 
But his Honour went on to suggest that the principle in Prasad may not have survived the enactment of s.422B of the Act notwithstanding the later decisions such as Le and SZMCE v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1803. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 328">" 
The applicant failed to respond to this letter. Whilst the applicant knew that he held the belief that the political situation in Burma in August 2007 did constitute an exceptional circumstance beyond his control he had never said so to the delegate and did not raise the matter with the Tribunal. Whilst there may be an obligation in limited circumstances to obtain information on a critical issue where that information is readily available and centrally relevant Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor v Le &amp; Anors [2007] FCA 1318 there is no general duty upon a Tribunal to make enquiries SZHUH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 1893 at [11] and any enquiries that would be made are only appropriate in rare and exceptional circumstances; SZMCE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 1803 at [28] . In Seyfarth v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2004] FCA 1713 Hely J said at [95]:
 
 "There is no general duty on a decision maker " to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which the applicant chooses not to embark upon " Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex Parte Applicant S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at [451] (Gummow and Hayden JJ) there is no general obligation on the Minister to make his own enquiries particularly where the visa holder has been given the opportunity to put all that he or she may wish to put before the Minister: Lorenzo v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2004] FCA 435 at [45] , [51] (Hill J).
