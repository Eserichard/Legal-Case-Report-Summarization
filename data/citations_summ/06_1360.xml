<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 744">11 Rule 44.12(2) of the FMC Rules expressly provides that, to avoid doubt, a dismissal of an application for relief by the Federal Magistrates Court under r 44.12(1)(a) is interlocutory. The FMC Rules bind Federal Magistrates but cannot bind this Court. See SZHUS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 64 at [2] although compare the reliance placed upon the provisions of the FMC Rules in SZHVP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1360 at [3] and NBLH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 209 at [1] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 2007">That decision had been the subject of challenges in this Court, the Federal Magistrates Court and the High Court in proceedings determined between May 2006 and June 2007: SZHVP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 633 ; SZHVP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1360 ; SZHVP v MIMA &amp; Anor [2007] HCATrans 290.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1201">3 I note that subrule (2) of r 44.12 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules provides that, "To avoid doubt, a dismissal under paragraph (1) (a) is interlocutory. " With respect to those responsible for making that subrule, it is not immediately apparent to me how the Rules of the Federal Magistrates Court can determine, in a way which is binding on this court for the purpose of s 24(1A) of its own Act , whether a judgment is interlocutory. The way in which this question has been dealt with in previous judgments of the court has varied. On some occasions subrule (2) has been adverted to as though it concludes the question whether a judgment by way of dismissal under par (a) of subrule (1), is or is not interlocutory: see SZHVP v MIMA [2006] FCA 1360 at [3] and NBLH v MIC [2007] FCA 209 at [1] . On other occasions, however, the characterisation of such a judgment has been determined as a matter of general principle: see SZHZB v MIMA [2006] FCA 547 and SZHUS v MIMA [2007] FCA 64. For my own part, I prefer to take the latter approach. I consider that an order of the kind referred to in r 44.12(1)(a) is interlocutory and I rely, for that conclusion, upon Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 and Rana v University of South Australia [2004] FCA 559 ; (2004) 136 FCR 344. </sentence>
