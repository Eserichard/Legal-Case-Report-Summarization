<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 159">The Tribunal found that the Applicant did not claim to be at risk of harm in China by reason of his accessing information about Falun Gong in Australia. In such circumstances, s.91R(3) is not engaged (see SZHFE v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No.2) [2006] FCA 648 per Jacobson J; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJGV &amp; Anor; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJXO &amp; Anor [2009] HCA 40 ; (2009) 238 CLR 642 at 653 and 665). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1342">The appellant when asked below what was the error of law which she relied upon she was unable to do so. Nonetheless the Court below was taken by counsel for the first respondent to the provisions of s 91R(3) although this section had not been raised by the appellant. The Federal Magistrate correctly accepted the submission of the first respondent that the Tribunal did not breach s 91R(3) by having regard to the appellant's absence of Falun Gong practice in Australia, in support of its finding that the appellant would not practice Falun Gong if she were to return to China. Section 91R(3) is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution: SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 per Jacobson J at [30]. Here, there was no relevant conduct. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1015">The submission is that the applicant had raised the suggestion that he had attended church in Australia at a prior Tribunal hearing in support of his claims. Thus, there was no question that the possible application of the decision of Jacobson J in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [39] could arise. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 834">The ground cannot be sustained and should be dismissed. Ground three
 
 The Tribunal failed to comply with s.91R(3) of the Act. 
 Mr Shariff submits that s.91R(3) of the Act applies when an applicant adduces evidence of conduct in Australia in order to establish a "sur place" claim: SZHFE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No.2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] (special leave to appeal was refused by the High Court, see SZHFE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2007] HCATrans 10 ; SZMJD v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 1297 at [96] . Mr Shariff submits that in this matter the applicant did not advance any evidence to strengthen her claims and accordingly s.91R(3) was not enlivened. Further, that the Tribunal pointed to her almost complete lack of involvement with Christianity since her arrival in Australia and concluded that Christianity was of no great importance to her (CB 104 at [43]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 917">Ms Hooper, who appeared for the Minister, has, no doubt, acting as a model litigant, referred the court to subsection 91R(3) of the Migration Act and submitted that the Tribunal did not breach it by having regard to the applicant's absence of Falun Gong practice in Australia, in support of its finding that the applicant would not practice Falun Gong if she were to return to China, for it is further submitted that, in a number of cases, the Federal Court has rejected the proposition that a Tribunal breaches subsection 91R(3) by taking into account activities of the applicant in Australia which are inconsistent with his or her claim for refugee status. Those decisions include SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [25] per Jacobson J at [30]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 675">In addition, a number of decisions after SZJGV have considered the operation of s.91R(3) and suggested that s.91R(3) is only in enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution (see SZIIF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 370 and SZNDT &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 482 referring to the decision of Jacobson J in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 , which preceded SZJGV and also the subsequent decision in SZLQX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1286 as well as SZLDV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 121). In this case, while the applicant sought to rely on attendance at a church at Padstow before his detention, that claimed conduct was found not to have occurred. What was taken into account was the absence of any conduct in Australia involving Christian activities prior to the detention. The absence of Christian activity before detention was not something that the applicant sought to rely on in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. That provides an additional indication that the circumstances are not such as to give rise to or establish a contravention of s.91R(3) of the Migration Act . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 486">It is unnecessary to resolve a third contention advanced by the Minister. This contention was that s 91R(3) is not engaged where an applicant does not seek to rely on conduct in Australia to support a well-founded fear of persecution (cf SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] per Jacobson J; SZLQX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1286 at [21] per Jacobson J) or where evidence of conduct is adduced or called by an applicant ( SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 at [16] and [21] to [23] per Spender, Edmonds and Tracey JJ). The contention was that the present Appellant did not seek to rely upon the 1999 or 2000 conduct and did not adduce evidence of such conduct. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 370">Counsel for the First Respondent submitted that this Court is bound by the principle espoused in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 (" SZHFE ") by Jacobson J where his Honour found that s.91R(3) is only enlivened when an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. In SZHFE the applicant had failed to take any steps in a period of seven years prior to his application for a protection visa to have articulated any fear of persecution in his home country or made enquiries about seeking to obtain refugee protection. In that case, the tribunal had regard to the applicant's inaction as evidence that the applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 384">Although the Tribunal did make reference in its reasons to the applicant's delay in seeking out Falun Gong practitioners following her arrival in Australia, it is questionable whether this amounts to a reliance on the applicant's conduct in practising Falun Gong in Australia. However, if it is, I accept the first respondent's submission that this delay was not advanced by the applicant in support of her claim and thus does not fall within the scope of s.91R(3): SZHFE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2006] FCA 648 and SZLDV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1211. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 251">Finally, although the applicant rightly says that inaction can constitute conduct within the meaning of s.91R(3) ( vide SZJGV's case at 462 [22]), it has been held, in decisions which bind me, that s.91R(3) is only enlivened by conduct in Australia on which an applicant seeks to rely to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution: SZHFE v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No. 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] ; SZLQX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1286 at [21] ; SZLDV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1211 at [19] and [20]. As the Minister submitted, the applicant did not put before the Tribunal, in support of his claims, his attendance at a medical examination in Australia and his failure to mention at that examination an alleged medical condition. These were not elements of his evidentiary case. Consequently, it was not conduct within the reach of s.91R(3). The fact that the Tribunal did not disregard it by reason of that provision did not amount to jurisdictional error. Conclusion
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 91">It is submitted that the Tribunal is only required to make factual findings in relation conduct in Australia where that conduct is capable of enlivening the operation of s 91R(3) if the applicant in fact engaged in it. A corollary is that, although the Tribunal must make findings of fact prior to applying 91R(3), ie, disregarding the conduct in Australia unless satisfied that it was engaged in otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the applicant's refugee claims, it is not required to make these findings prior to determining whether s 91R(3) would be enlivened in relation to that conduct if it had occurred. Authority supports the construction that s 91R(3) is not engaged where the applicant only mentions conduct in Australia in response to a question of the Tribunal ( SZMEQ v MIAC [2008] FMCA 1316 at [79]-[80]), and does not seek to rely on their conduct in support of a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution ( SZHFE v MIMIA (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] ; SZGDJ v MIAC [2008] HCASL 479 at [5] ; SZMEQ at [78]). The applicant did not raise any claims about practising Falun Gong in Australia of his own accord, and only claimed that he practised at Central and Parramatta in response to the Tribunal's question ([51] of the Tribunal decision). There is no other evidence that the applicant sought to rely on the conduct as part of his claim. Further support for the minister's submissions may be found in the decision of the Federal Court in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 and by the High Court in SZGDJ v Minister for Immigration [2008] HCASL 479. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FMCA 64">On 10 September 2008, the applicant filed in this Court an amended application for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision. He gave three grounds. The first: 
"The Tribunal failed to consider the fact that I have been practising Falun Gong in Australia, and my activities here may cause further persecution to me on my return to China. "
 
Although, Ms Weston, in her helpful written submissions has addressed this matter, on the basis of the authorities: SZHFE v The Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FCA 648 and SZHTC v The Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 1199 , in my view, this was not necessary because I am quite satisfied from the extracts that I have cited in this decision that the applicant did not tell the Tribunal that he had been practising Falun Gong in Australia. He may have practised Falun Gong in Australia but the Tribunal's job is to consider the evidence that was before it and not things that the applicant may have known but did not tell it. In case I am wrong about this, I am fully satisfied that the views expressed by Ms Weston in paras.15.1 and 15.2 of her written submissions are correct. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FMCA 18">Accordingly, she submitted, the second ground could be seen as a complaint that the Tribunal, having found that the conduct had occurred, should have disregarded that conduct. Relying on the decision of Jacobson J in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [24] , cited in SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [25] at [17], counsel for the Minister submitted that, whilst the Tribunal found that there had been some conduct in Australia, it was entitled to have regard to that conduct in the manner in which it did, having proper regard to the principles that govern s. 91R (3). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 1667">Where it is patently obvious that conduct could not have any corroborative impact on claims, the Tribunal does not need to make a decision pursuant to s.91R(3) (see SZHFE v Minister for Immigration (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] and SZGDJ v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 722). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FMCA 1218">Counsel for the First Respondent submitted that the Applicant's homosexual inaction is not "conduct". It was submitted on behalf of the First Respondent that the "conduct" is only relevant conduct for the purposes of s.91R(3) if such conduct in Australia is relied upon by an applicant, " to support a claim to have a well founded fear of persecution" . Note in particular the decision of Jacobson J in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 648 in particular at paragraph 30 where the entire quotation from His Honour reads as follows:- " [30] The effect of the submission is that s.91R(3) is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. In my opinion this is plainly the effect of s.91R(3) and the subsection is not enlivened in the present case. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FMCA 1390">The Full Court also found in SZJGV that it did not need to resolve whether s.91R(3) was enlivened only when an applicant sought to rely on his or her conduct in Australia to support a claim to be a refugee. In relation to that particular issue however, it is relevant to note an earlier decision of Jacobson J sitting as the Full Court of the Federal Court in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No.2) [2006] FCA 648 , in which his Honour concluded at [30] that: ... section 91R(3) is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. 
His Honour adopted this approach in subsequent decisions. I also note that in SZGDJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] HCASL 479 , a decision brought to my attention by the solicitor for the first respondent, Gummow and Kiefel JJ, in dismissing an application for special leave to appeal considered a Tribunal decision in relation to which at first instance the Federal Magistrates Court had applied the reasoning of Jacobson J in SZHFE that s.91R(3) did not apply unless the applicant relied upon conduct to support a claim to fear persecution. In that case the Tribunal had regard to the fact that while the applicant had claimed to be aware of the existence of an Australian support group for the Awami League he did not attend its meetings or play any role in its activities no breach of s.91R(3) was found. An appeal to the Federal Court had been dismissed by Weinberg J who observed that SZHFE had been followed in the Federal Court and had been the subject of a failed application for special leave to appeal to the High Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FMCA 1387">This is shown in the passage in which the Tribunal observed that the appellant said that she had not been practising Falun Gong in Australia because she was busy making money. In particular, as I said above, the Tribunal took into account the fact that the appellant had put "income generation in Australia before Falun Gong. " [21] In my view the answer to the suggestion that there was a breach of s 91R(3) is found in a decision which I gave in a matter of SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648. The Full Court in SZJGV referred to this decision at [16] and [17] of its reasons for judgment, without any apparent disapproval of my reasons. In that case I was of the view that the effect of s 91R(3) is that it is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. The Full Court in SZJGV referred to this decision at [16] and [17] of its reasons for judgment, without any apparent disapproval of my reasons. In that case I was of the view that the effect of s 91R(3) is that it is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. " 
The reasoning of Jacobson J in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 was referred to with approval in the High Court's reasons for refusing an application for special leave in the matter of SZGDJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] HCASL 479 at [5] per Gummow and Kiefel JJ. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] FMCA 1316">I consider that this is not a case where s.91R(3) of the Act has been enlivened. I accept the submission by the first respondent that s.91R(3) is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. As relevantly observed by Jacobson J in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] - [31] : The effect of the submission is that section 91R(3) is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well founded fear of persecution. In my opinion, this is plainly the effect of section 91R(3) and the subsection is not enlivened in the present case. Accordingly, in my view it is clear that there was no error in the RRT having regard to that conduct in making the findings which it did. This is particularly so in the present case where the appellant did not rely on his conduct in Australia to support his claim for refugee status 
 (and see SZHFE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA Trans 10 at 2 per Kirby J ; SZGDJ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 722 at [17] - [22] per Weinberg J ; SZIMY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 249 at [11] per Conti J ; and SZHTC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1199 at [25] per Gilmour J). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FMCA 1297">However this issue was addressed in an earlier decision of Jacobson J sitting as the Full Court of the Federal Court, by which I am bound. In SZHFE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No.2) [2006] FCA 648 his Honour concluded at [30] that s.91R(3) " is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. In my opinion this is plainly the effect of section 91R(3). " Jacobson J found that there was no error in the Tribunal having regard to conduct where the applicant did not rely on this conduct in Australia to support his claim for refugee status.

<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FMCA 1282">However, it is clear that their Honours were conscious of a contrary opinion in an earlier judgment of Jacobson J in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 , to which they refer at [16] and [17]. Jacobson J's judgment was also given in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction from this Court. It included the opinion: 30 The effect of the [Minister's] submission is that section 91R(3) is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. In my opinion this is plainly the effect of section 91R(3) and the subsection is not enlivened in the present case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2008] FCA 1330">27 The first respondent submits, for the following reasons, that s 91R(3) was not engaged in the present case. If the Tribunal had properly considered s 91R(3) it would not have applied it. Section 91R(3) is confined in its operation to sur place claims . The appellant did not make a sur place claim based on his conduct in Australia and therefore s 91R(3) did not arise: SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] ; SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA Trans 10 ; SZGDJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 722 at [17] - [22]. The appellant relied on his conduct in Australia, merely as corroboration of his claims to being a Christian in China. He did not claim to have a fear of persecution in China based on his conduct in Australia. Accordingly, the Tribunal could not have found that the appellant's fears for reason of his Christian conduct in Australia were well-founded and Convention based, because the appellant did not claim to hold such fears based on his conduct in Australia. Accordingly, s 91R(3) had no application. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] FMCA 1171">In SZLQX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1286 (" SZLQX "), a matter on appeal from this Court and in part concerning consideration of s.91R(3) of the Act, Jacobson J said, with reference to SZJGV and SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 (" SZHFE "), at [21]-[22] (a case in which he stated relevant principles): "21. In my view the answer to the suggestion that there was a breach of s 91R(3) is found in a decision which I gave in a matter of SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648. The Full Court in SZJGV referred to this decision at [16] and [17] of its reasons for judgment, without any apparent disapproval of my reasons. In that case I was of the view that the effect of s 91R(3) is that it is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. 22. The conduct to which the Tribunal referred, namely the appellant's work-related activities in Australia, was not conduct upon which she sought to rely to support her claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. It seems to me, therefore, that the Tribunal was not bound under s 91R(3) to disregard that conduct. In my view, there is no breach of that section within the principles which I stated in SZHFE , nor is there any breach of the principles stated by the Full Court in SZJGV . "  In SZLQX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1286 (" SZLQX "), a matter on appeal from this Court and in part concerning consideration of s.91R(3) of the Act, Jacobson J said, with reference to SZJGV and SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 (" SZHFE "), at [21]-[22] (a case in which he stated relevant principles): "21.

<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] FCA 1211">9 Counsel referred also to s 91R(3) , and drew my attention to the judgment of Jacobson J in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 , and to the judgment of the Full Court in SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105. Counsel submitted that the present case was covered by what Jacobson J said in pars 29 and 30 of his reasons in SZHFE , which observations were not displaced by the Full Court judgment in SZJGV , particularly by reason of their Honours' reservation in par 26 of their reasons in that case. I shall refer further both to SZHFE and to SZJGV presently, but, before doing so, I should return to the decision of the Tribunal in the present matter. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] FMCA 1106">First, it considered that the delay of one month between the applicant's arrival and making an application for a protection visa was relevant in determining that the applicant did not have a genuine fear of persecution. Second, it considered that the applicant had not engaged in any political activities in Australia that would suggest that he would engage in activities in Fiji in the future. These facts are similar to SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 648 , where a question arose as to whether the [Tribunal] erred in not applying section 91R(3) to disregard the fact that the applicant had been in Australia for seven years before applying for protection. Jacobson J (upholding Driver FM) concluded that no error existed, as the [Tribunal] was satisfied that the applicant's stay in Australia was motivated by the applicant's desire to undertake education courses in order to achieve permanent residency, and not for the purpose of strengthening a refugee claim. Jacobson J noted further that: [30] The effect of the submission is that section 91R(3) is only enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs26" from="[2008] FCAFC 105">Rather, the Tribunal considered that the articles had been published "solely in order to provide him with evidence to submit to [the] Tribunal. " His Honour held that the Tribunal, in these circumstances, was bound to disregard the applicant's conduct in arranging for the newspaper articles to be published. He held, relying on the decision of Jacobson J in this Court in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 , that s 91R(3) of the Act was enlivened where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct, engaged in Australia, to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution. Driver FM continued:
 "... It is true that the mischief to which s. 91R(3) is directed is conduct engaged in by applicants in Australia intended to force the hand of decision makers.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs27" from="[2008] FCA 722">11 The Federal Magistrate then dealt at length with the s 91R(3) point. He did so pursuant to a further amended application for review that was filed on 4 October 2007 and presumably stood in place of the original application for review. His Honour held that the matter was conclusively determined against the then applicant by the decision of Jacobson J in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648. In that case, Jacobson J held that s 91R(3) did not apply so as to require conduct engaged in by an applicant in Australia to be disregarded by the Minister unless the applicant relied upon such conduct to support a claim for protection. Counsel for the then applicant submitted that the decision in SZHFE was not correct and should not be followed. He put that submission somewhat boldly having regard to the fact that SZHFE had been the subject of an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court and that application had been refused. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs28" from="[2008] FCA 664">5 In SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 , Jacobson J had occasion to consider the power of the court to entertain a notice of motion to set aside an order dismissing an appeal where an Appellant had failed to appear. The circumstances of that case were slightly different to the present in this sense, in the proceedings before Jacobson J the application to set aside the dismissal order was filed before the entry of the dismissal order. As it happened, his Honour considered that there were two sources of power to set aside the dismissal order. One related to the fact that the application had been made before the formal entry of the order. That need not be explored further in the circumstances of this case. The nature of the other basis of power is neatly summarised by the following quote from his Honour's decision at para 4:
 The second is an implied power under section 23 of the Act to overcome the court's failure to provide a party with a hearing; see Yevad Products Pty Limited v Brookfield [2005] FCAFC 263 at [26] - [33] and the authorities there cited; see also DJL v Central Authority [2000] HCA 17 ; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at [189] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs29" from="[2008] FMCA 218">The counsel for the Applicant referred the Court to the decision of Driver FM in SZGDA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2] , where his Honour reviewed the authorities in relation to s.91R(3). His Honour stated that he was bound by the decision of Jacobson J in SZHFE v Minister for Immigration (No. 2) [3] . Driver FM stated that s.91R(3) did not apply "unless an applicant introduced his or her conduct in Australia to support a claim of having a well-founded fear of persecution". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs30" from="[2007] FCA 1303">4 On this application I need to consider two matters: (a) whether the applicant has an arguable case; and (b) whether the applicant has provided a satisfactory explanation for non-attendance.

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs31" from="[2007] FCA 1199">25 If it be that this aspect of the first ground asserts a breach of s 91R(3) of the Act because the Tribunal took into account the failure of the appellant to practise Falun Gong after his arrival in Australia, then this too fails. Section 91R(3) of the Act has application only where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia in support of a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution: SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] - [31]. That is not the case here. Ultimately the applicant told the Tribunal that he had not practised Falun Gong in Australia and the Tribunal so found.

<sentence id="cs34" from="[2007] FCA 249">11 Moreover as to the alleged breach of s 91R(3) of the Act, Driver FM observed that the same may only be enlivened in circumstances where an applicant for review seeks to rely upon conduct in Australia to support a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution, his Honour citing SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No. 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] - [31]. His Honour found that this was not a case where an applicant relied upon conduct in Australia to strengthen a protection visa claim, but was a case instead concerned with the situation where the Tribunal reached conclusions from the available material about a lack of activity in Australia. The appellant's conduct in Australia, involving her failure to communicate with Falun Gong practitioners or to join public practice sessions here, was plainly not conduct engaged in to support her claims, and hence s 91R(3) had no relevant operation. No error has been identified in this approach and none is apparent.</sentence>
