<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 223">Notwithstanding the helpful and detailed submissions made by both advocates, in reality consideration of this question boils down to what is the state of the authorities arising out of three decisions. The relevant portion of the Tribunal's decision is at paragraph 22 (CB82): "The Tribunal finds that the applicant was properly notified of the delegate's decision and is taken to have been notified on 6 April 2010. The judgments in Zhang v MIAC [2007] FCAFC 151 and MIAC v Abdul Manaf [2009] FCA 963 confirm that once a delegate's decision has been correctly notified, the time to make a valid review application will not start again even if the applicant is given the primary decision again. Therefore, the prescribed period of 21 days within which the application for review could be lodged ended on 27 April 2010. The application for review was not received by the Tribunal until 21 June 2010, after the prescribed period had expired. "  The third case to which counsel referred me was that of Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Manaf [2009] FCA 963 , a decision of Sundberg J given on 31 August 2009. The relevant facts were that: In February 2006 the respondent lodged an application for a further business visa in which he provided an address to which correspondence should be sent (the Bridgewater Way address). On 7 August 2007, the delegate refused to grant the visa and later on the same day sent a letter by registered post to the Bridgewater Way address enclosing a copy of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 178">She is thus taken to have received the document at that time. The time within which to apply to the tribunal would run from that date. Because of this [2009] FCA 963 ; 111 ALD 437 at 444 change in the law, the respondent says that the issues raised are no longer matters of public importance, and I should not write a judgment about them because "Parliament has moved on". [33] The explanatory memorandum to the Bill which became the Amending Act explains that the notification provisions in the Act and regulations are highly prescriptive and create fertile ground for the courts to find defects in notifications. Technical errors can be relied on by those seeking to delay the resolution of their cases despite no apparent prejudice flowing from the defect. 25. On the basis of the information relating to notification of review rights given in the first notification letter, the Tribunal finds that the letter was valid, and that the applicant was properly notified of the delegate's decision, and is taken to have been notified on 14 December 2001. Once a delegate's decision has been correctly notified, the time to make a valid review application does not start again, even if the applicant is given the primary decision again: MIAC v Abdul Manaf [2009] FCA 963. Therefore, the prescribed period of 28 days within which the application for review could be lodged entered on 11 January 2002. Grounds of review
  Mr Markus submits that the applicant's submissions incorrectly address the Federal Court authority directly on point referred to in the Tribunal decision: Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Abdul Manaf [2009] FCA 963 ; (2009) 111 ALD 437 per Sundberg J. In this the decision mentioned above, His Honour accepted the Minister's submissions to the effect that in circumstances where the first notification letter is defective, a subsequent notification of the decision does not have any legal effect. Once the prescribed period within which a valid application has to be made has expired, the Tribunal no longer has jurisdiction to review the decision in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCAFC 27">Jarrett FM then addressed an argument that the second notification, sent by the department on 17 March 2009, effectively "re-set" the timeframe in which a review application could be made. In this regard, his Honour discussed the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in H v MIMA (2002) 118 FCR 153 and Zhang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 151. Jarrett FM referred to, and followed, the more recent decision of Sundberg J in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Abdul Manaf [2009] FCA 963. Jarrett FM said at [58] and [61]: 
 
 In Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Abdul Manaf [2009] FCA 963 Sundberg J (sitting as the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia) dealt with an application to extend time within which to commence an appeal and the appeal itself. His Honour determined during the course of his reasons that: 
 

 Consistent with previous authority, s.494C of the Act does not create a rebuttable presumption of fact as to receipt of a notification sent using a method prescribed by s.494B of the Act. In this regard, his Honour discussed the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in H v MIMA (2002) 118 FCR 153 and Zhang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 151.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] FMCA 12">But as Mr Markus submits, even if it could be so construed this would not assist the applicant. I note what Sundberg J relevantly said in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Abdul Manaf [2009] FCA 963 (" Abdul Manaf "), a case which involved a "third letter" in circumstances involving notification of a delegate's decision where the first letter was found to be a valid notification, a second letter was found to amount to a re-notification, and in fact a third letter was sent (see at [6] to [8]). </sentence>

 56. But the authorities dealing with deeming provisions in relation to non-electronic communications make it clear that the effect of those provisions is not to create a rebuttable presumption of fact. They are not to be read as if they were subject to a proviso that the person is not taken to have received the document if the contrary is proved : Xie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 172 ("Xie") at [13] --- [14] per Spender, Kiefel and Dowsett JJ; see also the review of the authorities by Sundberg J in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Abdul Manaf [2009] FCA 963 at [21] --- [24]; and see Tay v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCAFC 23 at [16] --- [19] per Dowsett, Stone and Bennett JJ (emphasis added). 57. The same reasoning applies to the statutory deeming provision relating to electronic communications in reg 2.55(8).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 957">Such an argument does not succeed. In Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Abdul Manaf [2009] FCA 963 Sundberg J was faced with circumstances relevantly similar to those in the current case. An applicant applied for a visa and gave an address for service. A decision was made refusing the application. Notification was sent to the address for service. About 2 weeks later the applicant advised the Minister's department of a change of address. A copy of the notification was sent in response, but not to the address secondly notified. The first letter was returned to the department "unopened". The second marked: "no such address" ([2] to [4]). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] MRTA 2458">The Tribunal finds that the applicant was properly notified of the delegate's decision and is taken to have been notified on 13 May 2010.

Therefore, the prescribed period of 21 days within which the application for review could be lodged ended on 3 June 2010. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] RRTA 908">On the basis of the information relating to notification of review rights given in the first notification letter, the Tribunal finds that the letter was valid, and that the applicant was properly notified of the delegate's decision, and is taken to have been notified [in] July 2006. Once a delegate's decision has been correctly notified, the time to make a valid review application does not start again, even if the applicant is given the primary decision again: MIAC v Abdul Manaf [2009] FCA 963. Therefore, the prescribed period of 28 days within which the application for review could be lodged ended [on a date in] July 2006. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] MRTA 2214">The time for lodging an application for review begins when the applicant is taken to have been first validly notified of the decision, in this case by email taken to have been received on 27 May 2010, regardless of whether there is any subsequent notification ( MIAC v Abdul Manaf [2009] FCA 963 (Sundberg J, 31 August 2009)). The notification of 27 May 2010 sent by email to the applicant's authorised representative was a valid notification which clearly indicated that the applicant had 21 days from the date of that letter in which to lodge an application for review. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs14" from="[2010] FMCA 305">His Honour's decision was set aside on appeal. In Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Abdul Manaf [2009] FCA 963 Sundberg J (sitting as the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia) dealt with an application to extend time within which to commence an appeal and the appeal itself. His Honour determined during the course of his reasons that: Consistent with previous authority, s.494C of the Act does not create a rebuttable presumption of fact as to receipt of a notification sent using a method prescribed by s. 494B of the Act. The first notification was sent using a method prescribed by s.494B of the Act and the visa applicant was taken to have received the document in accordance with s.494C. The defect (ie., sending the letter to the wrong address) in the second notification letter could not affect the validity of a notification that had already been "taken" or "deemed" to have occurred prior to the second notification letter being sent. Section 347(1) of the Act requires an application for review to be made in the approved form and be given to the Tribunal within the prescribed period (21 days after the notification of the decision by the first notification letter). The application was not made within the prescribed period, and accordingly was not competent. No subsequent letter could confer on the Tribunal jurisdiction it did not have. </sentence>

In Duff v Freijah [1982] FCA 159 ; (1982) 62 FLR 280 , Northrop J said (at 287) that it was "well-established that delays by a solicitor are visited upon the client when those delays are relevant to the limitation periods". This does not seem to have been universally accepted: see Lucic v Nolan (1982) 45 ALR 411 (at 417). This approach was discarded in Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 which embraced the views of the English courts, summed up in the comment of Lord Denning MR in Salter Rex &amp; Co v Ghosh [1971] 2 QB 597 (at 601), "[w]e never like a litigant to suffer by the mistake of his lawyers".

<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] FMCA 1206">In relation to posted documents, sub-regulation (7) is in terms which have a long history of judicial consideration. It provides that a person "is taken to have received the document ... 7 working days ... after the date of the document" if it was posted for delivery in Australia. There are many cases which have noted that such a receipt is conclusively deemed to have occurred, even if actual receipt is proved not to have occurred for whatever reason (for example, see Murphy v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 657 ; (2004) 135 FCR 550 at [69] , Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Abdul Manaf [2009] FCA 963 citing Xie v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 172 at [13] - [14], and SZBMF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1427 ; (2005) 147 FCR 485). Such provisions have the evident general purpose "to eliminate uncertainty as to whether a document has been given to an applicant" (cf.
