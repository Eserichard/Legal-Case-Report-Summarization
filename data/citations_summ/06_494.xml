<sentence id="cs8" from="[2006] AATA 709">All are concerned with aspects of an application and its hearing in the Refugee Review Tribunal. The interpretation of s 422B has led to disagreement among differently constituted Federal Courts as to the extent of s 422B. They were summarised by Jacobson J in SZBZO v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs : [63] 
 
 " 28. Section 422B applies to applications to the Tribunal for review of a decision filed after 4 July 2002; see SZATG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1595 ; (2004) 83 ALD 596 at [31] ; see also SZBDF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1493 (' SZBDF' ) at [11]. It therefore applies to the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2006] FCA 807">14 Further, I note that where the Tribunal decides to reschedule a contemplated hearing at the request of an applicant, s 425A does not apparently apply to the notice of the rescheduled hearing: see SZDQO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1026 and SZBZO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 494. </sentence>
