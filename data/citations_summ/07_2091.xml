<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1301">On 24 December 2007, Flick J dismissed proceeding NSD 2004 of 2007 as an abuse of process pursuant to O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) ( Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 ; (2007) 243 ALR 315). On 17 September 2008, the Full Court (by majority) dismissed an appeal from that decision of Flick J ( Brock v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCAFC 165 ; (2008) 170 FCR 434). On 31 July 2009, the High Court refused an application for special leave to appeal from the Full Court's decision.  The question of the s 16 Notice's validity is one that has been agitated previously by Mr Brock both before Flick J in Brock [2007] FCA 2091 ; 243 ALR 315 and in the Full Court in Brock [2008] FCAFC 165 ; 170 FCR 434.  Upon the assumption that the s 16 Notice is invalid, Mr Brock submits that all subsequent steps in the extradition process (including the magistrate's determination of his eligibility for surrender under s 19 of the Act and the Minister's s 22 determination) are also invalid and of no effect. Mr Brock again seeks to rely on the reasoning in Williams. He argues that proper and adequate particulars of his conduct were not before the Minister when the Minister issued the s 16 Notice, that the Minister could not therefore form the opinion that the dual criminality requirement was met as required under s 16(2)(a)(ii) of the Act and that, for these reasons, the Minister's decision to issue the s 16 Notice was a nullity. Though the purpose to which Mr Brock ultimately seeks to put his arguments directed to establishing the invalidity of the s 16 Notice has changed, the arguments nonetheless incorporate the line of argument pursued by Mr Brock in the earlier proceedings ( Brock [2007] FCA 2091 ; 243 ALR 315 and Brock [2008] FCAFC 165 ; 170 FCR 434). Abuse of Process in Principle
  In Brock [2007] FCA 2091 ; 243 ALR 315 , Flick J had held, at [66] (p 330) of his Reasons, that the intervention of the s 21 proceedings had the consequence of determining, with finality, that each of the preceding stages in the extradition process, including the issue of the s 16 Notice and the magistrate's s 19 determination, had been lawfully discharged and that Mr Brock was eligible for surrender. At [60]---[63] (p 329) of his Honour's Reasons, his Honour said: 
 
 The applicant is eligible for surrender 
 
 Where the submissions of the minister do prevail is in respect to his submission that there has now been a judicial resolution of the question whether Mr Brock is or is not "eligible for surrender". It is, of course, the magistrate who makes the determination as to whether a person is "eligible for surrender".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1246">In addition, there is a strong presumption against interference with the statutory extradition process: see Harris at 413; Peniche v Hannan [1991] FCA 915 at [26] --- [30] (Kenny J); Forsyth v United Kingdom [2003] FCA 1084 at [46] ff (Carr J); Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 ; (2007) 243 ALR 315 at [72] (Flick J). The bringing of this proceeding at this stage results in the fragmentation of this process --- that is, intervention at an immediate stage of the process - in the absence of exceptional circumstances. Discretionary relief

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 284">The applicant, pursuant to s 21 of the Act, seeks a review of the second respondent's determination of 20 August 2008. Section 21(2) of the Act confines the power of the review court to confirming or quashing the order of the magistrate; the matter cannot be remitted to the magistrate - Zoeller v Federal Republic of Germany (1989) 90 ALR 555 at 563 and Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 ; (2007) 243 ALR 315 at 321. Where a review process undertaken by a court concerns, as is the case here, an issue arising under s 19(2) of the Act, that review is undertaken by way of a rehearing: Republic of South Africa v Dutton (1997) 77 FCR 128 at 136; 147 ALR 310 at 317. Section 21(6)(d) of the Act prescribes that the review court shall have regard only to the material before the magistrate: Zoeller at 582; Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs at 321; Snedden v Republic of Croatia [2009] FCA 30 at [18] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 18">63 Ms Brownhill conceded that the parties in the consolidated Risk proceedings were not identical to the parties in this native title application because the Litchfield Shire Council is a respondent in this native title application and was not a party in Risk . However, she submitted that the addition of this party did not affect the application of the principles of issue estoppel because the decision of Mansfield J in Risk was a decision in rem . On this point Ms Brownhill referred me to a series of decisions including: PE Baker v Yehunda (1998) 15 NSWLR 437 at 442 and 446, per Hope, Samuels and McHugh JJA; Wong v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 51 at [44] per Lindgren J; Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 at [65] and [70] per Flick J; Wik Peoples v Queensland [1994] FCA 967 ; (1994) 49 FCR 1 at 4 per Drummond J and WA v Ward [2000] FCA 191 ; (2000) 99 FCR 316 at [190] per Beaumont and von Doussa JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1539">30 Those conclusions were expressed somewhat generally, although his Honour did refer to his judgment in Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 ; (2007) 243 ALR 315 ( 'Brock' ) at [72]-[74]. His Honour's judgment in Brock was affirmed on appeal on 17 September 2008 ( Brock v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCAFC 165 ( 'Brock Appeal' ). Importantly, for present purposes, Lindgren and Tracey JJ said (at [77]):
 
 
 '77 We would also uphold the second ground advanced by Ms Gleeson of counsel for the Minister, for resisting the granting of leave to appeal. This is that according to the scheme of the provisions to which we have referred, the work to be done by the issue of a Notice of Receipt of Extradition Request under s 16 is spent once the s 19 stage in the process is reached . The presence of para (c) in s 19(2) demonstrates an intention that any challenge to the satisfaction of the dual criminality provision is to take place within the framework of an application under s 21 for review of the Magistrate's order. The Magistrate was required to satisfy herself independently that the dual criminality requirement was met, and was not required to review the Minister's having been previously satisfied that it was met for s 16 purposes: see Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Kainhofer (1995) 185 CLR 528 at 538-539. ' 
 (Emphasis added) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCAFC 165">11 On 24 December 2007, a judge of this Court dismissed a proceeding (the Primary Proceeding) brought by the applicant (Mr Brock) under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) for review of a decision of the respondent (Minister) made on 12 May 2005 to give a notice under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act 1998 (Cth) (the Act) in relation to Mr Brock (Notice of Receipt of Extradition Request). The Primary Proceeding was Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 ; (2007) 243 ALR 315. Subsection 16(1) provides:
 Where the Attorney-General receives an extradition request from an extradition country in relation to a person, the Attorney-General may, in his or her discretion, by notice in writing in the statutory form expressed to be directed to any magistrate, state that the request has been received. The Attorney-General and the Minister share responsibilities in the Attorney-General's portfolio, including in relation to extradition. Although the Act refers to the Attorney-General, the Minister is also able to exercise the Attorney-General's power under the Act: see s 19A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1988 (Cth); and generally, Mokbel v Attorney-General (Cth) [2007] FCA 1536 ; (2007) 162 FCR 278 at [22] - [29]. We note that the respondent was previously named in the title Minister for Justice and Customs, but pursuant to order 1 of the orders made by the primary judge in the Primary Proceeding, the name of the respondent in the title was changed to Minister for Home Affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1133">39 But the weakness of the position of Mr Tervonen is the fact that any such challenge which sought to impugn the validity of the request was properly the subject-matter of proceedings (in this case) seeking to impugn the decision made by the Minister under s 16 when giving effect to that request. The present proceeding was not commenced at the outset and before any decision authorised by the 1988 Act was made; the present proceeding was commenced only after all other attempts to challenge the decisions to give effect to the request proved unsuccessful. Compare: Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 at [72] ---[74] [2007] FCA 2091 ; , 243 ALR 315 at 332. Even if such an application is not itself foreclosed by Kainhofer , it is now too late to allow such an application to be pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 907">63 It is an abuse of process, in my opinion, to proceed in the way in which the applicant has. It could lead to the very unsatisfactory result that, contrary to the decision of Mansfield J, the decisions would be quashed for reasons not considered by him. That would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute: Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 6) [2004] FCA 1699 and Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 ; (2007) 243 ALR 315. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 331">49 Repetitious challenges to decisions made under the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth), or a failure to raise for resolution issues relevant to a decision the subject of review may constitute an abuse of process: Rivera v Minister Administering the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) [2007] FCAFC 191 at [13] ---[15] per Rares J [2007] FCAFC 191 ; , 99 ALD 235. See also Brock v Minister for Justice &amp; Customs [2007] FCA 2091.
