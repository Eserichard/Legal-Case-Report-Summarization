<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] HCATrans 282">On 6 December 2007, Justice Gordon dismissed the appeal: MZXLD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1912.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 106">24. Although new evidence will not generally be admitted on the hearing of an application for judicial review, evidence of what occurred at a hearing in support of a complaint about the absence of procedural fairness or bias in relation to the hearing, is an exception to the general rule, and may be admitted. (See MZXLD v Minister for Citizenship [2007] FCA 1912 at [10] - [11] ). 25. In my view, the Federal Magistrate erred, in the circumstances of this case, in failing to admit the tape of the hearing as evidence in support of an allegation of apprehended bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 142">Furthermore, the additional evidence was clearly directed to the merits of the appellant's application and therefore did not fall within one of the exceptional cases where evidence may be admitted in judicial review proceedings: see MZXLD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1912 at [10] - [11] per Gordon J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 922">Although new evidence will not generally be admitted on the hearing of an application for judicial review, evidence of what occurred at a hearing in support of a complaint about the absence of procedural fairness or bias in relation to the hearing, is an exception to the general rule, and may be admitted.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 378">Section 424A creates a mandatory obligation when it applies. In the present case, that section did not apply in relation to country information. That being so, there was no duty to give a notice under s 424A and, as a result, there can be no question of the manner of exercise of that duty to which s 422B(3) could have application: see MZXLD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1912 , Gordon J at [26]. 17. Subsection 422B(3) does not advance the applicant's argument under s 424A: if there was a breach of that section, there is a jurisdictional error irrespective of s 422B(3) and if there was no breach of that section because it did not apply at all, then s 422B(3) has no relevance.</sentence>
