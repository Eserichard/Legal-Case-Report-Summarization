<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 258">Section 46PO of the HREOC Act provided that the unlawful discrimination alleged in any application commenced in this Court must either be the same as the unlawful discrimination that was the subject of the terminated complaint or must arise out of the same acts, omissions or practices that were the subject of the terminated complaint. The Court has held that this provision prevents a complainant from relying, in a proceeding in the Court, on any act of unlawful discrimination which occurred after the relevant complaint had been lodged with the Commission: see Charles v Fuji Xerox Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1531 ; (2000) 105 FCR 573 at 580 (per Katz J); Maghiar v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 262 at [18] (per French J); Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [68] (per Weinberg J); Crvenkovic v Latrobe University [2009] FCA 374 at [11] (per Tracey J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 920">Mr Harrington referred to the letter from Access Law to his client on 
2 July 2010 (p.98 of the Affidavit of Susannah Palmer sworn 23 August 2010) which explained the reason for MLG915/2010 as follows: The reason for this 2 nd Application is that the Federal Magistrates' Court's jurisdiction is limited to the matter that the AHRC dealt with: Crvenkovic v La Trobe University [2009] FCA 374. As the Applicant alleges ongoing discrimination, it is necessary to bring fresh proceedings so as to confer the Court with jurisdiction to deal with the complaint up to the most current time practicable. </sentence>
