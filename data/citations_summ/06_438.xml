<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 958">The application of s 34(2) was also considered by the Full Court of this Court in New Zealand v Moloney . The case concerned allegations of sexual abuse of schoolboys between 1971 and 1980 by two members of a religious order. There were 15 complainants. The Magistrate had decided that the brothers should be extradited because the gravity of the allegation outweighed the combined factors favouring their release. This decision was quashed at first instance in a review conducted by Madgwick J: [2006] FCA 438. His Honour concluded that despite the seriousness of the allegations, there would very likely be a high degree of unfairness in the allegations not being brought until 22 and 31 years after the alleged offences are said to have occurred. His Honour was also concerned about the absence of a guarantee in any trial in New Zealand of a strong warning by the judge to the jury as to the very real problem in meeting such old allegations because the New Zealand courts have not followed the decision of the High Court in Longman v R [1989] HCA 60 ; (1989) 168 CLR 79 . As to factors personal to the alleged perpetrators of the crimes which might constitute oppression, Madgwick J observed (at [134]) they would "pale into insignificance, in my view, against the strong legitimate public interest in both Australia and New Zealand in having the charges dealt with in New Zealand". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 603">3 On the other hand, the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth), as explained at length in the reasons for my judgment (see Moloney v New Zealand [2006] FCA 438) , sets its face against any consideration of the underlying merits of the criminal proceedings which the New Zealand prosecuting authorities have sought to bring against the applicants. Apart, therefore, from any time- or costs-wasting events that they may have perpetrated, and none is suggested, there is no conduct of the applicants which can fairly be regarded as disentitlement to an order for costs where such an order is otherwise appropriate.</sentence>
