<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 803">Accordingly, because Undershaft dealt with the interpretation of Commonwealth legislation, Lindgren J considered that, by reason of this factor, he should follow the decision of Edmunds J in Virgin Holdings unless he thought it to be clearly wrong or plainly wrong: at [86]. However, his Honour noted that this did not relieve him of the necessity to embark upon a full consideration of the parties' submissions with a view to arriving at his own conclusion: see at [88]. See also Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission (2006) 230 ALR 254 ; [2006] FCA 819 at [15] , per Sundberg J and the cases there cited. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] NSWSC 1467">I am not satisfied that that onus has been discharged. There is a degree of difference between the situation arising where an application is made under s 138 of the New South Wales Evidence Act to exclude evidence on the basis of impropriety or illegality, and the situation arising in a judicial review application or other proceedings of an administrative nature. Even in the latter situation, an onus still falls on the applicant in a situation where a valid search warrant is in existence ( Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 819 ; Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301 ; [2001] 1111 FCR 175 at (235) per Hely J). Here, however, it is necessary for the accused to demonstrate that ss 3K(3)(a) and (b) were breached. It almost must also demonstrate that ss 3K(3)(B) and 3 (C) were breached.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCAFC 183">13 Sundberg J heard the warrant proceeding on 1 and 2 June 2006. On 30 June 2006, his Honour delivered judgment, dismissing the application. His Honour stated (in Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 819 ; (2006) 230 ALR 254 ("the warrant judgment") at [13]) that three issues fell for determination:
 
 
 &#8226; the applicant's attack on the warrant on the same grounds as those dealt with by Young J in A2 v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 106 (the A2 point); 
 &#8226; his attack on the procedure by which the Commission obtained the notebook; and 
 &#8226; his attack on the procedure by which the Commission obtained the DVDs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 939">26 Sundberg J found ( Egglishaw v ACC (2006) 230 ALR 254 ; [2006] FCA 819) that:
 
 &#8226; The computer was not seized at the hotel, but even if it was, s 3L was not engaged because the computer was not operated at the hotel and hence the taking of the forensic image was not unlawful. &#8226; The ACC was not bound to use the procedure provided in s 3L(1) and (1A) which involved operating the computer at the hotel and copying the information at the hotel by bringing equipment to the hotel. &#8226; The ACC had not failed to show that it was "significantly more practicable to [move the computer to the ACC offices] having regard to the timeliness and cost of examining ... [the computer there] and the availability of expert assistance," in compliance with s 3K(2)(a)(i).  31 Following the delivery of judgment by Sundberg J, Browne &amp; Co again wrote to Mr Milroy on 17 July 2006, as follows:
 
 [O]n 30 June 2006, his Honour Justice Sundberg delivered judgment in the matter of Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 819. These proceedings related to the hard drive of a laptop computer owned by our client (the Egglishaw hard drive) seized pursuant to a Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act) search warrant executed on our client's hotel room by members of the staff of the ACC on 14 February 2004. During the course of his judgment, His Honour effectively confirms that the Egglishaw hard drive was seized pursuant to section 3K of the Act. Purusant to section 3N of the Act, this entitles our clients to be provided with a copy of the material seized.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] WASC 247">94 The approach of Heerey J was approved by Branson J in Kennedy v Baker [2004] FCA 562 ; (2004) 135 FCR 520 at [85] and [86] and by Sundberg J in Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCA 819 at [19] . I would add to the proposition set out above that where documents are removed from premises without lawful authority, those responsible for the removal and those into whose hands the documents pass can have no title to them, nor any right to possession.</sentence>
