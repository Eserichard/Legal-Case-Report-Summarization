<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 910">I accept that people express their feelings in many ways and with varying degrees of openness or inhibition: Delahunty v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 309 ; (2004) 38 AAR 511. I accept that Mr Neath had a reaction that encompassed intense fear, and helplessness, especially given his ongoing concern that Jeparit was unarmed (per Budworth and Repatriation Commission [2000] AATA 127). I observe that even 'relief' and 'concern' have been found to be capable of being appropriate responses: Renton v RC [2009] FCA 268. Therefore, the answer to the question of whether the diagnosis was one properly made having regard to DSM-IV must be answered in the affirmative, per Repatriation Commission v Warren [2007] FCA 866 ; (2007) 95 ALD 606.
