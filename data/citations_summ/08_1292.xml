" In Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No. 2) [2008] FCA 1292 ; (2008) 170 FCR 357 , Kenny J was minded, at paras [42] to [58], to answer the question in the affirmative. However, in Williams v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (No. 2) [2009] FCA 103 ; (2009) 184 IR 367 , Jessup J was inclined to take a contrary view. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 133">In this instance I have the benefit of an elaboration in the written outline of submissions on behalf of Mr Phillips of the nature of the no case submission which is proposed to be made on his behalf. It is evident from that written outline that a detailed critique seriatim of the various aspects of the case which the Authority seeks to make is proposed to be made on behalf of Mr Phillips. Prominent in that critique is the submission that the case against Mr Phillips relies upon inferences being drawn based on allegations of his knowledge of corporate wrongdoing. That particular quality of the proposed no case submission sets it apart from one of those which was advanced before Kenny J in Cahill v Construction Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 ; (2008) 170 FCR 357 (Cahill (No 2)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1587">As I observed in CBI Construction Pty Ltd v Abbott [2008] FCA 1629 ; (2008) 177 IR 134 at [22] : 
 
 Consideration of the main object is a relevant consideration to the construction and application of the provisions of the BCII Act: United Group Infrastructure Pty Ltd v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (2005) 148 IR 399 at [23]-[25]; Cahill v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 at [50] - [51].

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1092">Section 38 of the BCII Act covers acts by persons other than employees. In Cahill v Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 ; (2008) 170 FCR 357 at [49] - [57], Kenny J held that the words "a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of building work" in paras (b) and (c) of the definition of "building industrial action" in the BCII Act covered the imposition of bans, limitations or restrictions by unions. Arguably s 38 extends to union officers in a case such as this. In any event the interlocutory injunction as against the CFMEU would, practically, be directed also at its employees, officers or agents. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 1040">The applicant sought the costs of the respondents' earlier no-case submission: see Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292. It will be recalled that I rejected the respondents' submission on the first limb of their no-case submission concerning the construction of the definition of "building industrial action" in s 36(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act . I declined to rule on the respondents' contention that the applicant's evidence did not make out the alleged contravention for the events after the crane incident on 21 February 2006 and following unless the Union and Mr Mates elected to call no further evidence, which they subsequently did. In the result, I have held that the applicant's allegations about events subsequent to Mr Mates having the crane and crane crew leave the Mount Street site were unproven. In these circumstances, I would make no separate order as to costs in respect of the respondents' no-case submission, but I have had regard to this submission and its outcome in making a more general order as to the disposition of the costs of the proceeding. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 223">In addition to the argument with which I have dealt at pars 86, 87, 88 above, counsel for the respondents made the omnibus submission that, of its nature, a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work could be engaged in only by the employees who would normally perform that work. In this respect, counsel relied upon the judgments of the Full Court in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (1998) 89 FCR 200 , 213 (which, as it happens, was later reversed in Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (2000) 203 CLR 194) and Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers [1999] FCA 1108 ; (1999) 91 FCR 463 , 486 [52]. The same submission was, however, rejected by Kenny J in Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 ; (2008) 170 FCR 357 , 370-381 [31]-[60]. Her Honour pointed out that the two Full Court judgments were concerned only with the question whether a restriction on work implemented by way of a picket line which prevented those who would otherwise perform the work from having access to their work site was a "ban, limitation or restriction" within the meaning of the definition then under consideration. They were not concerned with the question whether a union, or one of its officials, engaged in a "ban, limitation or restriction" by imposing a prohibition upon its members working, or working in a particular way. Indeed, the formal imposition of a ban, limitation or restriction upon particular work by a trade union, with the intent that its members would be bound to give effect, and would in fact give effect, thereto, has been, over the years, the very essence of direct action for the maintenance and improvement of the working conditions of employed persons. I agree with Kenny J that, in each of the judgments referred to, the Full Court was concerned with a different proposition from that now advanced on behalf of the respondents. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 103">Turning to the axis as between John Holland, on the one hand, and the AMWU and the CFMEU, on the other hand, I should commence by saying that nothing put to me by counsel for the applicants has persuaded me to depart from the provisional view which I expressed in my reasons of 6 February 2009 that a picket line, as such, is not to be regarded as a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work within the meaning of the definition of "building industrial action" in s 36(1) of the BCII Act. It was submitted on behalf of the applicants that, in Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 ; (2008) 170 FCR 357 , Kenny J had somehow qualified the conclusion of the Full Court in Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers [1999] FCA 1108 ; (1999) 91 FCR 463 to which I referred in par [31] of my reasons of 6 February 2009. The kind of situation with which Kenny J was concerned in Cahill is apparent from her Honour's exposition of the applicant's case there, in the following terms (170 FCR at 362 [10]): 
 The applicant's case was that, on 21 February 2006 at the Mount Street site, Mr Mates did three things that each constituted "building industrial action" within the meaning of paras (b) and (c) of the definition in s 36(1) of the BCII Act. He: (1) demanded the crane crew from Independent Cranes Pty Ltd ("Independent Cranes") who had come to the Mount Street site to undertake crane work that day to shut down the crane and leave; (2) telephoned the office of Independent Cranes and said that its crew were not to work on the Mount Street project; and (3) telephoned the CFMEU's offices or a representative of the CFMEU and instructed the person he contacted to instruct Maurie Hill (the CFMEU organiser responsible for mobile cranes in Victoria (FEDFA division)) to ring Sergi Cranes and other crane operators to warn them off working at the Mount Street site.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCA 52">The no-case submission had two limbs. The first limb concerned the proper construction of the definition of "building industrial action" in s 36(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act . The Union and Mr Mates argued that, in order to constitute "building industrial action" within paras (b) and (c) of the definition in s 36(1) , the action in question must be that of employees in respect of their work. It followed, so they said, that there was an evidentiary hiatus in Mr Cahill's case because Mr Cahill had not adduced any evidence that any "ban, limitation or restriction" had been imposed by employees in respect of the work to which the ban, limitation or restriction related: see below at [9]. For the reasons previously stated, however, the Union and Mr Mates failed to persuade me that their construction should be adopted. I accepted that, if there was a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of building work imposed by a union , then the definition of "building industrial action" might be satisfied: see Cahill v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 (referred to below as "the No-case Ruling") at [59]. Also for the reasons previously given, I was satisfied that it was just and convenient for this ruling to be made without putting the Union and Mr Mates to their election. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1804">19 The workers did not take industrial action as such. They were called off the job by Mr Fahnle. However, the organisers, on behalf of the Union, imposed a ban on the performance of work on the site after the meeting between the organisers and some of the workers on the morning of 20 October 2005. The bans on the concreting works lasted until 8.00 am the next day. The bans on earthworks lasted until the afternoon of the next day. Bans of that sort constitute "building industrial action" under s 36(1) of the Act : see Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 at [58] , per Kenny J.</sentence>
