The orders and judgment under appeal were made and was delivered on 4 July 2006 ( Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 847). The judgment of 4 July 2006, in large part, reflected reasons in an earlier judgment of 29 May 2006 ( Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Limited [2006] FCA 640). Both judgments, read together, provide the reasons for the orders for joinder, made on 4 July 2006. Leave to appeal was given by a Judge exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Court on 28 September 2006 ( Macquarie Underwriting Pty Ltd v Permanent Custodians Limited [2006] FCA 1291). </sentence>
