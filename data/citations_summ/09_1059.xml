<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] MRTA 1088">The Tribunal is of the view that it is able to consider the results of an IELTS test undertaken after the application was lodged. This view is supported by comments made obiter dicta by Jagot J in MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 who indicated that a test undertaken after the application would meet the requirements in cl.485.222, and that it does not have to be the same test as that with respect to which arrangements had been made to meet the requirements of cl.485.215(c). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] MRTA 1034">In MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 (21 September 2009) the applicant had provided with the visa application an IELTS test report form showing test scores that were not sufficiently high to demonstrate competent English. The applicant then supplied the Tribunal with an IELTS test report form from a test undertaken after the visa application was lodged which demonstrated that the applicant had achieved a score of at least 6 in each of the test components. Although the decision turned on the proper meaning of the expression "the applicant has made arrangements to undergo" a language test, Jagot J's judgement contains the following obiter observations on the question whether the provisions require the result of 'competent English' for the purpose of cl.485.222 to be the result of the same test in respect of which the applicant had made arrangements to undergo for the purpose of paragraph 485.215(c) (at [38]): 
 
 ... I see no reason to read the provisions as necessarily requiring the result of competent English for the purpose of cl 485.222 to be the result of the same test in respect of which the applicant had made an arrangement for the purpose of cl 485.215(c). This makes sense. A test may be cancelled for reasons beyond an applicant's control. An applicant may not be able to sit the test arranged for reasons beyond his or her control. ...

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] MRTA 963">The Tribunal also notes that the IELTS test in which the applicant achieved a test score of at least 6 for each of the 4 test components of speaking, reading, writing and listening was not the test in respect of which he had made arrangements to undergo for the purpose of paragraph 485.215(c).

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] MRTA 912">The IELTS test which demonstrates that an applicant has achieved sufficient scores to meet the criterion in cl.485.222 does not have to be the same English test for which arrangements had been made at time of application: MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 (" Grant "). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2011] MRTA 662">The IELTS booking receipt provided by the applicant at time of application was for a test to be undertaken on 17 January 2009. The test undertaken by the applicant on 11 September 2010 is not the test for which the applicant provided the IELTS booking receipt. However, in MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 , the Court found that the test which an applicant undertook for the purposes of cl.485.222 does not have to be the same test for which the IELTS booking was made. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2011] MRTA 661">The IELTS booking receipt provided by the applicant at time of application was for a test to be undertaken on 27 September 2008. The test undertaken by the applicant on 25 September 2010 is not the test for which the applicant provided the IELTS booking receipt. However, in MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 , the Court found that the test which an applicant undertook for the purposes of cl.485.222 does not have to be the same test for which the IELTS booking was made. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2011] MRTA 539">In reaching the decision to refuse the visa, the delegate was satisfied that the applicant had made arrangements to undertake an IELTS test on 29 March 2008 and as this test took place prior to the date of lodgement, the delegate was satisfied that the applicant met the requirements of cl.485.215(c). However, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant met cl.485.215(c). In order to meet cl.485.215(c), the test must occur after the date of application: MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059. Evidence that the applicant has undergone a test prior to the date of application will not be sufficient to meet the requirements of cl.485.215(c). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2011] MRTA 480">The IELTS booking receipt provided by the applicant at time of application was for a test to be undertaken in September or October 2008 The test undertaken by the applicant on 10 April 2010 is not the test for which the applicant provided the IELTS booking receipt. However, in MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 , the Court found that the test which an
applicant undertook for the purposes of cl.485.222 does not have to be the same test for which the IELTS booking was made. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2011] MRTA 414">The Tribunal accepts that the applicant has achieved a score of at least 6 in each of the 4 test components in an IELTS test on 26 September 2009. As the IELTS booking receipt was for a test to be undertaken on 6 September 2008, the test undertaken by the applicant on 26 September 2009 is not the test for which the applicant provided the IELTS booking receipt.

The main point there involved the construction of 485.215(c) in circumstances where an applicant failed a language test, but later set another test and satisfied the competent English standard. 
Mr Horan referred to a "non-Berenguel construction of 485.215(b), because if Berenguel had applied, then it would have been possible to satisfy (b) on the facts of Grant" (T p.31, l.46). That in effect is saying that a single judge of the Federal Court, on hearing an appeal, came to a different conclusion on 485.215(b) than the High Court on 885.213(b).

 The potential anomaly created by this construction (that an applicant would be better off taking a test after the time of application than before if there was any risk of not obtaining the required result before that time) is answered by the fact that demonstrating the making of the arrangement is not onerous and is largely within an applicant's control.

This was a case by way of appeal by the Minister from a Federal Magistrate's decision; it involved different factual circumstances to that in Mr. Vurugonda's case; the visa applicant in that case was eventually unsuccessful although he was successful before the Federal Magistrate.

<sentence id="cs40" from="[2010] MRTA 163">In terms of whether the applicant meets cl.485.215 which, in part, requires that the applicant submit, at the time of application, evidence that they intended to sit an IELTS test, the applicant had this evidence at the time of application, however, the test results did not relate to the booking for the test that was ultimately undertaken by the visa applicant. In this regard, the Tribunal has reference to the decision in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 in which Jagot J states: 
...I see no reason to read the provisions as necessarily requiring the result of competent English for the purpose of cl.485.222 to be the result of the same test in respect of which the applicant had made an arrangement for the purpose of cl.485.215(c). This makes sense. A test may be cancelled for reasons beyond an applicant's control. An applicant may not be able to sit the test arranged for reasons beyond his or her control...
 The applicant at the time of application and decision by the Department had in fact achieved an IELTS test score of at least 6 for each of the 4 test components of speaking, reading, writing and listening and therefore meets cl.485.222. CONCLUSIONS 
 Given the findings made above, the Tribunal remits the matter with a direction that the applicant meets cl.485.215 of Schedule 2 and cl.485.222 of Schedule 2. DECISION 
 The Tribunal remits the application for a Skilled (Provisional) (Class VC) visa for reconsideration, with the direction that the applicant meets the following criteria for a Subclass 485 (Skilled - Graduate) visa: cl.485.215 of Schedule 2 to the Regulations; and cl.485222 of Schedule 2 to the Regulations.

<sentence id="cs41" from="[2010] MRTA 181">The Federal Court in MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 (Jagot J, 21 September 2009) considered the construction of cl.485.215. In light of this decision, the Tribunal notes the following considerations and scenarios: 
 What is required to meet cl.485.215(c)?

<sentence id="cs42" from="[2010] MRTA 178">The applicant has succeeded in meeting the regulations at the review stage by having achieved competent English, on the basis of the test results before the time of decision by the Tribunal, notwithstanding that competent English may not have been achieved in the actual test to which the booking related.

Indeed, the Full Court in Kamal noted that 'the complexity of the Regulations and the various occasions upon which they have been amended suggests that comparison of the language of Item 5A404 with the language of other provisions in the Regulations is likely to be of little assistance' (at [18], see also MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 at [43] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs44" from="[2010] MRTA 119">These indicate that one of the marks has been increased from 5.5 to 6 and that the applicant had achieved the score of at least 6 in each of the four test components. These results have been verified by the Tribunal For the reasons set out in the Tribunal's decision [2008] MRTA 1109 , the Tribunal is of the view that it is able to consider the results of a test undertaken after the application. This view is supported in MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 which confirms both that the test undertaken after the application would meet the requirements in cl. 485.222 and also that it need not be the same test as that with respect to which arrangements had been made for the purpose of cl. 485.215(c). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs45" from="[2010] MRTA 68">Prior to the applicant lodging her application, cl.485.222 which has now been removed, enabled an applicant to demonstrate that at the time of application they had made arrangements to sit an IELTS test and the decision in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 (unreported, 21 September 2009, Jagot J) enabled the applicant to succeed at the review stage by having competent English, on the basis of her latest test results, before the time of decision, notwithstanding that competent English had not been achieved in the actual test to which the booking related. With the removal of cl.485.222 on 27 October 2009, this is no longer the case and the visa applicant's application must fail.

As this has not occurred, the application cannot succeed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs49" from="[2010] MRTA 48">The Tribunal finds in relation to the language test that the applicant had already sat in August 2007, that evidence of this is not sufficient to meet cl.485.215(c).

 A. Test results may be regarded as evidence of that level of English, and if the test was undertaken in the 2 years prior to application, it may be said that the applicant has the requisite level of English at the time of application. The fact that the evidence of that standard of English is only available after the application is made does not mean that the applicant did not satisfy the relevant English language requirement at the time of application. An applicant in these circumstances could not meet cl.485.215(c) because to satisfy that paragraph the test must not have been taken at the time of application: MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 at [42] . 
 (vi) Can the applicant meet cl.485.215(c), if 
 

 - s/he undertakes a test in the 2 years prior to the application and fails to achieve the requisite test score, but 
 
 
 - provides evidence with the application that s/he has made arrangements to undertake another IELTS or OELT test after the date application? 
 
 Yes. 
 
 Yes. Clause 485.215(c) is an alternative to paragraphs (a) and (b), and is not expressed as being conditional upon the applicant not having undertaken a test in the preceding 2 years. Justice Jagot in MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 did observe that it was not the purpose of the scheme to encourage an applicant to take multiple tests, but her Honour did not specifically address this scenario, or conclude that cl.485.215(c) could only be met by persons who had not previously sat a test.

As the applicant's representatives noted, in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 Jagot J accepted that cl.485.222 should not be read as referring only to the test which the applicant had made arrangements to undergo at the time of application but rather as permitting an applicant to take multiple language tests in order to achieve the necessary result at time of decision. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs54" from="[2009] MRTA 3041">The Tribunal observes that the recent decision of the Federal Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 (21 September 2009) draws a specific distinction between those cases where an IELTS test accompanied the visa application and those where this is not the case. In Grant's case , the applicant had provided IELTS test results with his visa application, indicating test scores that were not sufficiently high to demonstrate competent English. The applicant then supplied the Tribunal with IELTS test results for a test undertaken after the visa application was lodged, which demonstrated that he had achieved a score of at least 6 in each of the test components. Her Honour Jagot J held that, in circumstances where an applicant has already taken the language test, but had not achieved the required IELTS test results to meet the definition of competent English, there is no arrangement to undergo anything in the future, as the arrangements for a language test had already been completed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs55" from="[2009] MRTA 3038">The visa applicant stated that he was aware that a number of his representatives other clients had succeeded in their subclass 485 visa applications before the Tribunal and had been allowed to undertake a further IELTS test and provide the results to the Tribunal; he stated that he was unsure as to why this was not applicable in his case. The Tribunal explained that the issue in his case related to a time of application criterion and it was likely that the cases he was referring to had involved a time of decision criterion. In particular, the Tribunal clarified for the visa applicant how the decision in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 (21 September 2009) applied to his case, given that evidence of an IELTS test booking had not accompanied his visa application in May 2008.

  In respect of the IELTS test results achieved by the visa applicant on 20 November 2008, the Tribunal notes that the recent decision of the Federal Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 (21 September 2009) applies. In Grant's case , the applicant had provided IELTS test results with his visa application, indicating test scores that were not sufficiently high to demonstrate competent English. The applicant then supplied the Tribunal with IELTS test results for a test undertaken after the visa application was lodged, which demonstrated that he had achieved a score of at least 6.0 in each of the test components.

 an arrangement to undergo something involves an element of futurity, in the sense of a thing yet to be done. Where a visa applicant has made an arrangement for an IELTS test and has already undertaken the test, there is no longer an arrangement to undergo anything in the future and cannot satisfy cl.485.215(c).

The Tribunal understands the Federal Court to have been addressing in Grant the scenario in which an applicant had previously made arrangements for and undergone a language test in the past, and was now seeking to rely on those past arrangements to satisfy the time of application requirement in cl.485.215(c). Mr Guan's interpretation seeks to extend the notion of 'futurity' to an altogether different scenario --- namely to any intention or plan, even contingent. The phrase was considered in MIAC v Grant [2] in the context of cl.485.215(c) though the Federal Court's conclusions are equally applicable to the Subclass 487 time of application criteria which employ this phrase. This judgement made clear that there are a number of scenarios that will not satisfy the requirements to have "made arrangements to undergo a language test". For instance, it addressed the situation where an applicant has arranged and undergone a language test before the making of the application. The Court was clear that in such circumstances the criterion would not be satisfied as this meaning disregarded "the commonsense proposition, demonstrated by the statutory scheme, that an arrangement to undergo a test is only relevant where the results of the test remain unavailable" and that "the natural and ordinary meaning of the phrase denotes a future requirement".

 [1] In Explanatory Statement to Migration Amendments Regulations 2008 (No.7), it was stated that cl.485.215(c) was introduced in response to claims by migration agents and clients that there were capacity problems within the IELTS regime. In MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 (Jagot J, 21 September 2009) at [41], the Court commented that its construction was consistent with this. [2] [2009] FCA 1059 (Jagot J, 21 September 2009).

  The phrase was considered in MIAC v Grant [2] in the context of cl.485.215(c) though the Federal Court's conclusions are equally applicable to the Subclass 487 time of application criteria which employ this phrase. This judgement made clear that there are a number of scenarios that will not satisfy the requirements to have "made arrangements to undergo a language test". For instance, it addressed the situation where an applicant has arranged and undergone a language test before the making of the application. The Court was clear that in such circumstances the criterion would not be satisfied as this meaning disregarded "the commonsense proposition, demonstrated by the statutory scheme, that an arrangement to undergo a test is only relevant where the results of the test remain unavailable" and that "the natural and ordinary meaning of the phrase denotes a future requirement". [3]  If the matter were remitted, it would then be open to the Department to consider whether the application met other criteria, including the time of application criteria. Mr Guan also discussed the meaning of the term: 'if the application was accompanied by evidence that the applicant has made arrangements to undergo a language test'. He drew to the Tribunal's attention an excerpt from the Federal Court decision in MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 , in which Jagot J found at [34]: 
[...] the common sense proposition, demonstrated by the statutory scheme, [is] that an arrangement to undergo a test is only relevant where the results of the test remain unavailable. The ultimate statutory purpose is to ascertain whether an applicant has "competent English". He suggested that application, particularly in the context of an on-line application, should be taken to mean more than the physical application, but rather the process of applying up to the time of decision.</sentence>

 [1] In Explanatory Statement to Migration Amendments Regulations 2008 (No.7) it was stated that cl.485.215(c) was introduced in response to claims by migration agents and clients that there were capacity problems within the IELTS regime. In MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 (Jagot J, 21 September 2009) at [41], the Court commented that its construction was consistent with this. [2] [2009] FCA 1059 (Jagot J, 21 September 2009).

<sentence id="cs95" from="[2009] MRTA 2581">As the applicant has not met cl.485.215(a) or (b), the Tribunal has considered whether the applicant meets cl.485.215(c). The Tribunal has considered the representative's submission that the applicant meets cl.485.215(c) on the basis of the IELTS test of 3 September 2007 provided to the Department. The Tribunal is not satisfied that this test, undertaken prior to the date of application, is evidence in accordance with cl.485.215(c). The Tribunal considers that such an approach is consistent with the Full Federal Court decision in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 , at [28] to [29]. The Tribunal, therefore, finds that the applicant's visa application was not accompanied by evidence that the applicant had made arrangements to undergo a language test specified for the purposes of cl.485.215(c). Accordingly, the applicant does not satisfy cl.485.215(c). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs96" from="[2009] MRTA 2515">The applicant has provided the results of an IELTS test which he undertook on 24 October 2009 showing the requisite scores to demonstrate competent English. The Tribunal has verified these results and accordingly is satisfied that the applicant achieved a test score of at least 6 in each of the four test components in a test conducted not more than 2 years before the day on which the application was lodged. The Tribunal notes that this test was undertaken after the test for which evidence of arrangements was provided at the time of application. The Tribunal considers that there is nothing in the Schedule 2 time of decision criterion that requires the language test for which the applicant made arrangements to undergo at the time of application to be the same test at which the applicant succeeded in obtaining the required English standard. This view is supported in a recent decision of MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 at [38] . </sentence>

<sentence id="cs123" from="[2009] MRTA 2267">The applicant has provided the results of an IELTS test which he undertook on 20 June 2009 showing the requisite scores to demonstrate competent English. The Tribunal has verified these results and accordingly is satisfied that the applicant achieved a test score of at least 6 in each of the four test components in a test conducted not more than 2 years before the day on which the application was lodged. The Tribunal notes that this test was undertaken after the test for which evidence of arrangements was provided at the time of application. The Tribunal considers that there is nothing in the Schedule 2 time of decision criterion that requires the language test for which the applicant made arrangements to undergo at the time of application to be the same test at which the applicant succeeded in obtaining the required English standard.

In Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 Jagot J accepted that cl.485.222 should not be read as referring only to the test which the applicant had made arrangements to undergo at the time of application but rather as permitting an applicant to take multiple language tests in order to achieve the necessary result at time of decision. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs131" from="[2009] MRTA 2162">The Tribunal also finds that the applicant has achieved a score of at least 6 in each of the 4 test components on an IELTS test conducted not more than 2 years before the date of application. The Department has verified the IELTS test results. The Tribunal notes that the IELTS test was conducted on 7 February 2009 and therefore relates to a different test than that for which the booking referred. The Tribunal has given consideration to the judgement of the Jagot J. in MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 and the Tribunal considers that there is nothing in the Schedule 2 criteria which requires that the language test for which the applicant made arrangements to undergo at time of application be the same test in which the applicant succeeds in obtaining the required English standard. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the applicant has 'competent English' as defined in 1.15C(a)(i). The Tribunal finds that the first named applicant meets cl.485.222. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs132" from="[2009] MRTA 2121">Given this evidence, the Tribunal is of the opinion that cl.485.215(c) was introduced to enable applicants who had sought to undertake an IELTS test but were unable to do so due to 'capacity problems', to make arrangement to register for such a test and to undergo the test when they were able to do so. The Tribunal is satisfied that the intention was that the making of arrangements before the application to undergo the test at a date after the application was sufficient to meet the time of application requirement in cl.485.215(c) and that the test could be undertaken at a later date for the purpose of cl.485.222. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that it is able to give consideration to the results of an IELTS test that was, as in the present case, undertaken after the application is made. The case of MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 supports this interpretation.  In the case of MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 , Jagot J commented favourably on an interpretation that permits the Tribunal to consider, for the purposes of cl.485.222, the results of a test which is not be the same test as that with respect to which arrangements had been made for the purpose of cl.485.215(c). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs145" from="[2009] MRTA 1840">The wording of the requirement --- that a test must be conducted not more than 2 years before the day on which the application was lodged --- is clear and unambiguous and requires the test to have been conducted within a specified period before the application is made. The past tense in the reference to the test being conducted, at the time of application, also implies that the test must have been conducted before the application was made and not after the date of the application. This is also consistent with the Explanatory Statement in the SLI 2007 No. 257 which relevantly states that r. 1.15C requires the IELTS test to be conducted within the two years before the date of the application. The Tribunal considers the reasoning in Kamal to be unhelpful, as the Full Court considered the statutory provision that was substantially different to the one that is relevant in this case (cf MIAC v Grant [2009] FCA 1059 at [43] ). </sentence>
