<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 695">147 An order that costs be assessed as a gross sum does not envisage that any process similar to that of taxation should take place, however the power must be used judiciously and after giving the parties an adequate opportunity to make submissions on the matter: Ualesi (t/a Australian Empire Imports) v Expeditors International Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 26. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 455">There could be consequences if the taxation was not conducted in that fashion, which would include the opportunity to re-visit the appropriateness of granting the application under O 62 r 4(2)(c) and ordering costs of and concerning the taxation process itself: see eg Ualesi (t/as Australian Empire Imports) v Expeditors International Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 26 ; Australasian Performing Rights Association [1999] FCA 1006 and s 37N of the Federal Court Act. As far as costs are concerned, this could involve ordering any costs to be paid on a solicitor and own client basis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1259">The purpose of an order such as O 62 r 4 is to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation involved in litigation arising out of the taxation process: Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 at 120; Leary v Leary [1987] 1 WLR 72. The power to order gross sum of costs is one which has to be exercised judicially, and after giving the parties adequate opportunity to make submissions on the matter: Auspine Ltd v Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd [1999] FCA 673 ; (1999) 93 FCR 1 ; Ualesi (t/a Australian Empire Imports) v Expeditors International Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 26. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1119">4 The purpose of the rule is to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation involved in protracted litigation arising out of the taxation process: Beach Petroleum v LV Johnson (1995) 57 FCR 119 at 120. An order that costs be assessed as a gross sum does not require that any process similar to that involved in taxation should take place. However, the power must be exercised judicially and after giving the parties adequate opportunity to make submissions on the matter: Ualesi t/a Australian Empire Imports v Expeditors International Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 26.
