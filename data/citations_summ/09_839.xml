<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1481">But the Court must make an assessment whether or not particular clauses of agreements, or some part of them, that have become part of the evidence before it, actually have the character that attracts the obligation of the court to make an order restricting the principle of open justice under s 50 or in the exercise of its inherent or implied jurisdiction: John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd v Police Tribunal of New South Wales (1986) 5 NSWLR 465 at 476C-F per McHugh JA, Glass JA agreeing; Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417 at 437- 438 per Viscount Haldane LC. The court will only make such an order if it is satisfied that is necessary to protect the administration of justice. In general, that will occur because there is evidence or other material that the clauses or information have or has the character that enlivens the power and concomitant obligation to order confidentiality: see too Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd v Minister of State for Home Affairs (No 3) [2009] FCA 839 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cement Australia Pty Limited (No 2) [2010] FCA 1082 at [13] - [14]; Dye v Commonwealth Securities Limited (No 2) [2010] FCAFC 118 at [120] - [123] per Marshall, Rares and Flick JJ. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 563">The principles of open justice require that all evidence before a court be open to the public gaze. This achieves the important objective of transparency in judicial decision making that is fundamental to the proper administration of justice and public confidence in the integrity and independence of the courts in their decisions. It is an objective which, on occasion, must be balanced against the paramount duty of the court to do justice. In Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417 at 437-438, Viscount Haldane LC explained those principles, which have been followed and accepted as fundamental in Australia since Dickason v Dickason [1913] HCA 77 ; (1913) 17 CLR 50 at 51 per Barton ACJ, Isaacs, Gavan-Duffy, Powers and Rich JJ. One of the exceptions to which his Lordship referred was the protection of secret processes and confidential information. I discussed these principles in Siam Polyethylene Company Limited v Minister of State for Home Affairs (No 3) [2009] FCA 839 at [7] - [8]. That was a case involving the deployment of material in open court during the course of a trial. Slightly different principles may be apposite in interlocutory proceedings where the parties are preparing for trial and may need to show documents, that may or may not become public by being received into evidence, to persons who would otherwise, because of confidentiality concerns, not be desired by one or more of the parties to have access to them. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 837">Under s 269TG(3)(b) a notice issued under s 269TG(2) must include a statement of the respective amounts that the Minister ascertained, at the time of publication of the notice, was or would be the normal value of the goods to which the declaration relates, the export price of those goods and their non-injurious price. However, s 269TG(3A) permits the Minister to retain the confidentiality of commercial and valuable information as to those prices by not making them part of a public notice (see Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd v Minister for Home Affairs (No 3) [2009] FCA 839]. Nonetheless, the scheme of s 269TG(3A) is clear: it requires the Minister to ascertain the normal value, export price and non-injurious price for the purposes of the declaration and the consequent imposition of anti-dumping duties under the Dumping Duty Act .  After I published these reasons on a confidential basis on 7 August 2009 (see Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd v Minister of State for Home Affairs (No 3) [2009] FCA 839) the parties informed me that I had used a confidential figure in [95] above. I have withdrawn those reasons and made a correction by deleting the reference and using a neutral description in its place. That is the only change to those reasons, apart from the addition of this paragraph. I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty-seven (127) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares. Associate:
