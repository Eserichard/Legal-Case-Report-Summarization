<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1382">17 In light of the doubt with the reasonably ready availability of funds to repay the judgment sum if an appeal succeeded, I consider the appellants are entitled to some limited relief. In these circumstances, as in Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd v Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union [2006] FCA 180 per Kenny J, it is appropriate that the appellants have a limited stay subject to conditions. The condition would be that the monies the subject of the judgment from which the appellants appeal be paid into an appropriate interest bearing account. I would not grant a complete stay of execution of the judgment in the circumstances. </sentence>
