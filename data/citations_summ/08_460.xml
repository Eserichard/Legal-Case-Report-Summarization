<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 145">9 The decision of the MRT was unsuccessfully challenged at first instance in this Court: Sherzad v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 460. In order for the visa applicant to be regarded as the 'remaining relative' of the appellant, it was necessary for him to satisfy the Minister (including, in the alternative, the Minister's delegate) or, on review, the Tribunal, that he had not had contact (within a reasonable period before making the application for the visa) with an overseas near relative. Each of his mother and two sisters were overseas near relatives. However, the challenge to the decision of the MRT was based upon the contention that the lack of contact with the sister in Iran, as found by the MRT, was sufficient. </sentence>
