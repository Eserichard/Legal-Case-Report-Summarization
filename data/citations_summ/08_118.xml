<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] AATA 21">The meaning of the phrase "inability to obtain appropriate clinical management", which appears in various Statements of Principles determined by the Repatriation Medical Authority under s 196B of the VE Act, has been considered by the Federal Court of Australia. In Repatriation Commission v Money [2008] FCA 118 ; (2008) 100 ALD 527 Stone J said (at 536): 
 "In my view the plain meaning of 'appropriate clinical management' would include not only active therapeutic treatment but also advice on the management of symptoms and other measures that would improve a patient's quality of life even if they had no effect on the ultimate progression and outcome of a condition. " 

 
In Brew v Repatriation Commission [1999] FCA 1246 ; (1999) 94 FCR 80 Merkel J (with whom Mansfield J agreed) said (at 87, 88):
 
 "In my view Sundberg J [at first instance] was quite correct in treating the meaning of 'inability' ... as 'lack of ability; lack of power, capacity, means' (the Macquarie Dictionary) or 'the condition of being unable; lack of ability, power or means': the New Shorter Oxford Dictionary. The dictionary definitions embrace what may fairly be described as objective barriers such as lack of power, capacity or means or a subjective barrier such as the 'condition of being unable'. Whether the objective or subjective barrier to obtaining treatment is made out in a particular case depends upon the facts of that case. 
 ... 
 ... If a veteran is subjected to any psychological or emotional circumstances which are such that, as a matter of practical reality, the veteran could not reasonably be expected to take steps to obtain appropriate clinical management for a medical condition I see no reason why those circumstances are not capable of constituting a 'condition of being unable' to obtain treatment.
