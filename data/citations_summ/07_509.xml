<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 254">In Paton v Campbell Capital Limited [1993] FCA 449 this was described as placing "something of an onus" on the party seeking the order to satisfy the court that such an order should properly be made" (at [6]). (3) Appeals attract different considerations from trials at first instance. As stated at [8]-[9] in Clack v Collins :
 
 
 [8] In Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 509 at [20] Mansfield J referred with approval to the decision in Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch D 34 at 38. In that case, Bowen LJ said: 
 

 
 
 
 The general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant, that, from time immemorial, has been the rule at common law, and also, I believe, in equity. There is an exception in the case of appeals, but there the appellant has had the benefit of a decision by one of Her Majesty's courts, and so an insolvent party is not excluded from the courts, but only prevented, if he cannot find security, from dragging his opponent from one court to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 513">In Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 509 at [20] Mansfield J referred with approval to the decision in Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch D 34 at 38. In that case, Bowen LJ said:

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 273">A single judge has power to order the provision of security for costs of an appeal: Croker v Deputy Registrar of the High Court of Australia [2003] FCA 681 at [2] per Hely J; and Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 509 per Mansfield J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 89">As to the second and third matters on this list, while impecuniosity is generally regarded as a significant factor in ordering security for costs at first instance, the situation is fundamentally different on appeal because, by then, the unsuccessful party will have already had the opportunity to exercise the jurisdiction of the Court and the question changes to: should the unsuccessful party be allowed to force the successful party into another Court whilst being unable to meet the costs that may be awarded if he or she is again unsuccessful: see Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch D 34 at 38 per Bowen LJ; Skyring v Sweeney [1999] FCA 61 at [6] per Spender J; Thompson v Robinson [2005] QCA 253 at [6] per Keane JA and Moore v Macks [2007] FCA 509 at [20] to [21] per Mansfield J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 205">14 The word "oppressive" is used in this area to describe an application for security that is used merely to deny an impecunious applicant a right to litigate. See Jianshe Southern at [27]. As a general rule poverty is not a bar to a litigant at first instance. However the position is different as to appeals. In Skyring v Sweeney [1999] FCA 61 at [6] Spender J said:
 
 Impecuniosity ought not to be a bar to a person prosecuting at first instance a claim, but the position on appeal seems to me to be fundamentally different. In effect, in the absence of an order for security for costs in the circumstances of this case, Mr Skyring, in effect, is given a free hit, and that seems to me to be intrinsically unfair.
