<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1463">On 13 December 2006, Marshall J refused an application for leave to appeal out of time against Phipps FM's decision. His Honour expressed the view that the Federal Magistrate's decision was "free from doubt such that it would be futile to extend the time within which to allow an appeal to be filed": see Dellios v Zegarac [2006] FCA 1733 at [19]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 804">By an application dated 8 December 2006 the applicant sought a review of the registrar's order pursuant to s 35A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the FCA Act").

On 15 December 2006 Justice Marshall in this Court dismissed the application for review in Dellios v Zegarac [2006] FCA 1733. </sentence>
