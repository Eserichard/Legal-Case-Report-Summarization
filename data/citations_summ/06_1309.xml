129 Other cases are to the contrary. In re Spargos Mining NL (1990) 3 ACSR 1 , a case on s 320 of the Companies (WA) Code also in the terms that the company's affairs "are being conducted" oppressively, it was said at 44 that it was "clear ... from the section itself that it is not necessary that the unfairness be continuing at the time of the petition or at the time when the court comes to consider the matter", but that in the exercise of the discretion it may be thought that there is no present requirement for the grant of relief in relation to past oppression. A number of previous decisions were distinguished on the ground of "the broader formulation of s 320" since they were decided. To the same effect are re Dalkeith Investments Pty Ltd (1984) 9 ACLR 247 at 253 and Reid v Bagot Well Pastoral Co Pty Ltd [1993] SASC 4323 ; (1993) 12 ACSR 197 at 205, on an equivalent s 320. In De Tocqueville Private Equity Pty Ltd v Linden &amp; Conway Ltd, re Linden &amp; Conway Lt d [2006] FCA 1309 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 587 , a case on s 232, it was said at [25] -
 

 
 
 "Finally, it is not necessary that the conduct of which the plaintiffs complain be continuing at the time of the application or at the time when the court comes to consider the matter. However, that question may well be relevant as to whether relief is granted at all or what is the appropriate relief: Re Spargos Mining NL (1990) 3 WAR 166 ; 3 ACSR 1. " </sentence>
