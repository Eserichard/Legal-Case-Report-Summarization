<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 1033">ASTRA asserts that MAA would not be entitled to make a complaint alleging unlawful discrimination in the provision of services under s 24 of the Disability Discrimination Act , and does not accordingly possess a relevant interest for the purpose of s 30(1A) of the AAT Act. Section 46F of the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth) (the AHRC Act) provides that "a person aggrieved" may lodge a complaint with the Commission alleging unlawful discrimination. In Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 615 , Collier J determined that the applicant, an unincorporated association established to "ensure equitable and dignified access to all premises and facilities", was not "a person aggrieved" and therefore unable to bring a complaint under the AHRC Act . The applicant, Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc, had complained that the respondent Council had allegedly failed to maintain bus stops that met the relevant disability standard and was therefore in breach of the Disability Discrimination Act . Her Honour said (at [52], [53]): 
 
 [T]o be a "person aggrieved" by breach of s 32 [Disability Discrimination] Act and the Disability Standards formulated pursuant to s 31, it is necessary to show that the complainant has more than an intellectual or emotional concern in the subject matter of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWADT 74">13 The word 'person' is defined in the Interpretation Act 1987 to include "an individual, a corporation and a body corporate or politic". A corporation may be an 'aggrieved person' if discrimination has occurred by reason of the race of associates or members of the corporation: Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168 at 236; Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 615 ; (2007) 162 FCR 313 at 329-330. In this case, the discrimination is alleged to have been on the ground of the disability of an individual, as distinct from a corporation or body corporate or politic. An 'individual' is defined in the Interpretation Act as a 'natural person': s 21. The Macquarie Dictionary, 3rd edition, The Macquarie Library, defines a 'natural person' as 'an individual human being (as opposed to an artificial being)'. </sentence>

 PAZIOS &amp; ANOR v PULTENEY GRAMMAR SCHOOL (NO. 2) 
 [2008] SAEOT 14 

 THE TRIBUNAL DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING JUDGMENT: 

 
 The complainants Peter Pazios and Kristofer Pazios, by their litigation guardian Mary Pazios, have sought to amend their Particulars of Complaint in a number of respects. A recent decision of the Federal Court of Australia is persuasive in this regard. I refer to Access for All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 615 at 313 per Collier J. In that judgment, His Honour Justice Collier canvassed the meaning of "person aggrieved" in the context of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) ( HREOC Act). At issue was whether the applicant, being an incorporated association, could be an aggrieved person for the purposes of the HREOC Act. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1356">In this case, although the HREOC complaint does refer to Mrs Campbell's late husband, her young son and various family members, they appear in the factual context of the complaint, rather than as "a person aggrieved" for the purposes of s.3(1) of the HREOC Act . [27] In the Court's view, there can be no question that examined objectively Mrs Campbell was a person aggrieved, and therefore entitled to make a complaint to HREOC, and is therefore a person on whose behalf the complaint was lodged, and is therefore an "affected person" for the purposes of s.46PO(1) of the HREOC Act . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] TASRMPAT 285">7. A court or tribunal must always be wary of dismissing an application summarily Collier J in Access for All Alliance ( Hervey Bay Inc.) v. Harvey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 615 referring to Barwick CJ in General Steel Industries Inc v. Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; [1964] 112 CLR 125 at 130 said at para 14:
 
 
 
 "The power to dismiss an application summarily must be exercised with great caution and only in the interest in the clearest of cases to ensure that an applicant is not deprived of its opportunity for trial of its case. "
 
 

The Tribunal in the current matter determined to dismiss the Applicant's application on the basis that he had failed to substantiate a proper interest in the subject matter. It had previously however decided to issue a summons on a prima facie finding. The fact that the application was ultimately dismissed does not invalidate the application and deprive the Tribunal of the ability to award costs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] AATA 1876">Seven parties representing the interests of recreational fishers also applied to be joined. All of the parties are incorporated, except for the Narooma Port Committee, which is represented by Dr Philip Creagh. It is necessary that each association's interests (as distinct from its members' interests) are affected by the decision under review ( Re Maunsell and Partners Pty Limited v Export Development Grants Board (1980) 2 ALD 813 at [22]; Access for All (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 615 at [59] ). Part of the Conservation Council's case is that conditions should be imposed on recreational fishers. The Australian Recreational and Sport Fishing Confederation Inc relied on its objects, which include the representation of Australia's recreational fishers. Although this is not sufficient in itself, we are satisfied that the interests of the association are affected. We are satisfied that the interests of the other recreational fishing parties are also affected. All of the recreational fishing parties were represented by the same solicitors. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 974">28 Second, while I accept the submission of the applicant that its application was brought to effect change in the area of disability discrimination and could not be characterised as being for personal or financial benefit, I also note that the applicant commenced discrimination proceedings in the name of an incorporated association, where, as is clear from my judgment in Access For All Alliance [2007] FCA 615 , particularly at [47] --- [63], the weight of the case law is against such an organisation having standing to do so. The applicant has caused the respondent to incur costs in seeking to have these proceedings dismissed. 

17 It is clear from my decision in Access For All Alliance [2007] FCA 615 that I did not accept a number of the respondent's submissions and that the submissions of the parties, in particular the written submissions, did not correspond with each other in that the parties raised quite different arguments in support of their positions. It is also clear that the submissions of the Commissioner were very helpful, in particular with regard to the issue of whether the rights which the applicant was seeking to assert were private or public rights, and with respect to issues relevant to "aggrieved person" in the meaning of the DD Act upon which my decision eventually turned. 1 When I delivered judgment in this matter on 2 May 2007 ( Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 615) my orders were as follows:
 
 
 1. The application filed by Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc on 5 May 2005 be dismissed. 38 It appears that the respondent did attempt to engage with the applicant prior to the commencement of litigation and it is possible that the litigation in this case could have been avoided. However, one would expect that the same could be said in relation to almost all litigation. In relation to the respondent raising the issue of standing, as indicated in my judgment Access For All Alliance [2007] FCA 615 at [38] I did not accept the applicant's submissions at that time that the only avenue open to the respondent in the circumstances would have been to bring an application under the ADJR Act to challenge the acceptance by HREOC of the complaint. The standing of the applicant was addressed at the hearing by both parties, although not in written submissions by the respondent. 15 The applicant submits in summary:
 
 
 &#8226; The basis of the respondent's "strike out" claim, as found in its Statement of Facts and Contentions filed on 19 June 2006, was: 
 
 
 
 
 1. In the absence of an allegation of discrimination per se it was not possible for the Court to make a finding of unlawful conduct by the respondent. 2. The reference to equivalent access in the Disability Standards for Public Transport 2002 required that any allegation of a breach of the Standards be supported by evidence of discrimination. 3. The applicant required the Federal Attorney-General's consent to make a complaint of a breach of the Standards, which was the initiating process for the proceedings, or the Attorney-General should be the complainant. 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; in my judgment I dismissed all three contentions of the respondent ( Access For All Alliance [2007] FCA 615 at [22] - [34], [70]-[73])
 &#8226; the respondent did not in written submissions raise the contention that the applicant was not an "aggrieved person" or "affected person" for the purpose of s 46PO of the HREOC Act
 &#8226; while the applicant's application was dismissed, this was not a result of any contention or submission put by the respondent. Instead, the success of the respondent was based on the acceptance by the Court of the submissions filed by the Acting Disability Discrimination Commissioner ("the Commissioner"). </sentence>
