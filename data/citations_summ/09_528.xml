<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 247">"The Tribunal is not required to address every piece of evidence before it, provided that it considers the integers of the claim": Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at 342 [79] per Allsop J with whom Heerey J agreed. But as French, Sackville and Hely JJ observed in Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs at [47] (supra) : 
 "The inference that the Tribunal has failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure expressly to deal with that issue in its reasons. But that is an inference not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point". 
 
However, the Court found:
 
 "It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected. Where, however, there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the Tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked".

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 253">The submission was that the Tribunal did not consider or address this evidence in its analysis, and an inference can therefore be drawn that it was overlooked ( Singh v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 389 ; (2001) 109 FCR 152 ; (2001) 194 ALR 599 (" Singh "), NAJT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51(" NAJT ") at [205] to [213]. See also SZJQN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 1550 (" SZJQN ") at [28]). That is, the Tribunal overlooked critical evidence and that this reveals jurisdictional error ( VAAD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 117 at [77] , Martinez v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 528 ; (2009) 177 FCR 337 ; (2009) 256 ALR 32 at [50] to [52], SZOBS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 1000 at [33] to [37]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] NSWSC 120">The concept of statutory amendment to reverse the effect of a judicial decision is not, of course, unknown: Martinez v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 528 ; 177 FCR 337 at 341 [5] .

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1188">On 19 September 2008 there commenced items 5, 6(3) and 7 of Schedule 4 to the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No 1) 2008 (Cth) which included within it a provision deeming decisions by the Minister to cancel a visa pursuant to s 501 to have been as valid as it would have been if the visa in question had been "granted". The legislation did not, however, refer to decisions of the Tribunal. This led Rares J to conclude in Martinez v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 528 ; (2009) 177 FCR 337 at 348-350 [29] - [32], [36] that a decision of the Tribunal affirming an earlier decision to cancel a visa was not rescued by the remedial legislation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 734">Ms Burt referred to the following passage in Toro Martinez v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 528 at [46] : 
 "The tribunal is not required to address every piece of evidence before it, provided that is considers the integers of the claim: Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2201) [2001] FCA 1196 ; 113 FCR 396 at 342 [79] per Allsop J with whom Heerey J agreed. But as French, Sackville and Hely JJ observed in Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 at 641 [47] "the inference that the tribunal had failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure expressly to deal with that issue in its reasons. " However, they said that where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue at least has been identified at some point the inference will not be drawn too readily and continued: 
 
 "It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected. Where, however, there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked". 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 470">Ultimately, the cases referred to by the applicant stand for the principle that, in order to constitute jurisdictional error, an alleged failure to consider evidence must amount to a failure to 'truly ... engage with the claim as presented by the visa applicant. ' [4] Another way of phrasing this principle is that the alleged failure to consider evidence must have resulted in the second respondent failing to consider an integer of the applicant's claim. [5] Importantly, even where the second respondent makes 'an error of fact based on a misunderstanding of evidence or even overlooking an item of evidence', [6] this is not sufficient to constitute jurisdictional error. Even where an issue was raised which, 'if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the [second respondent's] review of the delegate's decision' and that issue was not dealt with expressly in the second respondent's published reasons, there is no necessary implication that the issue was overlooked by the second respondent --- only a possible inference. [7] Jurisdictional error will only be found where it can be said that any error of fact or failure to consider evidence results in a conclusion that the second respondent has not considered the applicant's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] AATA 490">On 13 October 2009, the Federal Court, by consent, ordered that the Tribunal's decision be quashed and the matter remitted to the Tribunal for re-determination, the Minister having conceded that the Tribunal's decision was affected by jurisdictional error as a result of the Federal Court decision in Martinez v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2009) 177 FCR 337 ; (2009) 109 ALD 260 ; (2009) 256 ALR 32 ; [2009] FCA 528 (and following the Federal Court decision in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 171 FCR 56 ; (2008) 102 ALD 521 ; [2008] FCAFC 132 and the amendments made by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No 1) 2008 ) .

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 902">The applicant then referred there to the judgement in Toro Martinez [2009] FCA 528 (Transcript page 7 line 17) where Justice Rares found evidence to be " powerful, strong corroborative and fundamental" to that case. Weight is a matter for the Tribunal and here the Tribunal did not consider the evidence here to have that weight. That finding is not open to review. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 891">In any event the Tribunal's obligation is to make its determination having regard to " relevant" material in the sense considered in Craig v The State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 and Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at [16] --- [17]. If a Tribunal granted or failed to consider relevant material in a way that affected the exercise of power it would fall into jurisdictional error ( Craig at 179 and Toro Martinez v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 528 at [43] per Rares J). The jurisdictional error considered above can be characterised as a failure by the Tribunal to have regard to such relevant material, being the material before it evidencing the value of independent orders shipped by G Ping in the period between 2006 and early 2007. As discussed, such evidence " bears upon the facts to be found" (see SZDGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2008] FCA 1638 ; (2008) 105 ALD 25 at [23] ) and was " relevant material" in the Craig v South Australia sense (see WAFP , SBAA, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [82] and Martinez at [43]-[51]). </sentence>
