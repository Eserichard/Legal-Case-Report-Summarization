<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 231">It is difficult to bring the offer within the precise terms of O 23 of the Federal Court Rules . For one thing the respondent and cross-claimant does not ask me to give effect to O 23 r 11 as to the costs before the offer. However, even if the offer does not fall within the terms of O 23 the offer was a reasonable one and one the offeror bettered at trial. It is a 'good start' and relevant to the discretion as to costs if the offeree's rejection of the offer at the time it was made was imprudent or (plainly) unreasonable: McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 (' McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) ') at 597 [22]-[23] per Buchanan J; APF Properties Pty Ltd v Kestrel Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2016 at [18] - [25] per Heerey J). Like Buchanan J in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) I need only consider if the rejection or non-acceptance of the offer was imprudent and I need not consider whether the other limb of the test is unreasonable (see Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] - [218]), or plainly unreasonable (see The Sanko Steamship Company Ltd v Sumitomo Australia Ltd [1996] FCA 22 ; Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 571">I am bound to follow matters of principle enunciated by the Full Court. In that regard, it may be, as Buchanan J highlights in the following passage from his judgment in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) [2007] FCA 2086 ; (2007) 164 FCR 591 at 597, [22] , that there is a difference in opinion at intermediate appellate level as to whether, for the purpose of satisfying a condition precedent to the awarding of indemnity costs and as an alternative to "imprudent", the rejection of an offer of compromise should be able to be described as "unreasonable" or "plainly unreasonable": In Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 ( Dukemaster) Sundberg and Emmett JJ said, in a case like the present where O 23 r 11 did not apply because an applicant had been wholly unsuccessful, that an applicant for a more generous award of costs than party-party costs 'must show that the rejection of the offer was imprudent or plainly unreasonable' (see at [7]). There has been doubt expressed about the soundness of the statement in Dukemaster that rejection of an offer, if unreasonable, must be 'plainly unreasonable' in the light of the earlier judgment of a Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] --- [218], to which Wilcox J also referred in Coshott (see Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1489 at [59] --- [62]). 
In the earlier of the Full Court authorities, Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at 432-433, [218] , the point was made that the conduct of an offeree need not be "plainly unreasonable" in order to warrant the ordering of indemnity costs because "To adopt an especially high standard of unreasonableness would operate as a fetter on the discretion to award indemnity costs and diminish the effectiveness of the Calderbank offer as an incentive to settlement. " I respectfully agree and, for that reason, would choose to follow the earlier Full Court authority were that to be critical to the resolution of the costs application. It is not though because in both Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 and Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 the alternative of imprudent rejection was acknowledged. Like Buchanan J in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) (No 2) and, as his Honour noted (at [22]), like Heerey J in AFP Properties Pty Ltd v Kestrel Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2016 at [24] --- [25], it is sufficient to assess whether the rejection of any of the offers was, "imprudent". That basis of assessment accords with the exemplar given by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited , which I have already noted, whose judgment, as Heerey J acknowledged in AFP Properties (ibid), is the locus classicus on the subject. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 2086">
 
 
 

22 In Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 ( 'Dukemaster' ) Sundberg and Emmett JJ said, in a case like the present where O 23 r 11 did not apply because an applicant had been wholly unsuccessful, that an applicant for a more generous award of costs than party-party costs 'must show that the rejection of the offer was imprudent or plainly unreasonable' (see at [7]). There has been doubt expressed about the soundness of the statement in Dukemaster that rejection of an offer, if unreasonable, must be 'plainly unreasonable' in the light of the earlier judgment of a Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] --- [218], to which Wilcox J also referred in Coshott (see Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1489 at [59] --- [62] ( 'Seven Network' )). I do not need to express any view on this issue because, as will be seen, even if the stricter test of 'plainly unreasonable' is to be applied where appropriate, I do not need to apply it to my consideration of the present application. It will be sufficient to assess whether rejection of the offer was imprudent (see also APF Properties Pty Ltd v Kestrel Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2016 at [24] --- [25]).</sentence>
