<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 995">1 This proceeding came before me as an application for leave to appeal from a decision of a judge of the Court on appeal from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal'): Druett v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2007] FCA 475. The appellant appears in person. At the hearing, counsel for the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (named in the notice of appeal as the Department of Family and Community Services) ('the Department') accepted that leave to appeal was not required. As an appeal from a decision of a judge of the Court to dismiss an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal, that is the case. Counsel also accepted that service, which had been effected by service on the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, was sufficient.</sentence>
