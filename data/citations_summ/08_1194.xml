<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1211">Professor Charman's evidence also demonstrates that Dr Marshall's reliance on propranolol was unsound given the differences in solubility, structure and activity between that compound and venlafaxine hydrochloride. Moreover, cases show that such a statement is unlikely to constitute a false suggestion. In Apotex Pty Ltd (formerly GenRx Pty Ltd) v Sanofi-Aventis (2008) 78 IPR 485 ; [2008] FCA 1194 at [127] , Gyles J observed: 
 
 Viewed in an objective fashion, if the question is asked, "'surprising' and 'unexpected' to whom? ", presumably the answer would be, "to a notional person skilled in the art in Australia". On that basis I would not conclude that the statements were false.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] APO 26">The opponent made submissions as to whether the invention constituted a valid selection from the prior art. The relevant law on selection patents is set out in Re: IG Farbenindustrie AG's Patent as follows: [12] 
 
 'Three general propositions may, however, I think be asserted as true: First, a selection patent to be valid must be based on some substantial advantage to be secured by the use of the selected members. (The phrase will be understood to include the case of a substantial disadvantage to be thereby avoided). Second, the whole of the selected members must possess the advantage in question. Third, the selection must be in respect of a quality of a special character which can fairly be said to be peculiar to the selected group'.

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 945">Further, Alphapharm submitted that the impossibility representation is an objective statement of fact of a position of impossibility for all time and cannot be read subjectively as limited to the inventor ( Apotex Pty Ltd (formerly GenRx Pty Ltd) v Sanofi-Aventis (2008) 78 IPR 485 ; [2008] FCA 1194 at [126] - [127]). Enlafax-XR uses hydrogel tablet technology, which itself falsifies the impossibility representation. If limited to the priority date of the method patent, the statement is still false as Dr Marshall's and Professor Charman's evidence indicates. They both gave evidence that, in 1996, a hydrogel tablet technology formulation would be possible to be achieved by a person skilled in the art. The falsity is thus analogous to that found in Prestige Group (Australia) Pty Limited v Dart Industries Inc . (1990) 26 FCR 197 at 218-219 in that the method patent claims that using hydrogel tablet technology is impossible in the methods of the invention and yet does not exclude hydrogel tablet technology from the invention claimed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 630">Smith &amp; Nephew claims, on the basis of that evidence, that Bagautdinov anticipated claims in the Patent. The test for lack of novelty has been succinctly restated by Gyles J in Apotex Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis [2008] FCA 1194 ; (2008) 78 IPR 485. His Honour there reviewed the relevant authorities beginning with Hill v Evans [1862] EngR 365 ; (1862) 4 De G, F &amp; J 288 and including General Tire &amp; Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd [1972] RPC 457 (" General Tire ") and concluded, at 514 [54]; 
 'The main principle is that, if the prior inventor's publication contains a clear description of something that would infringe the patentee's claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee's patent, the patentee's claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty. Alternatively, if the prior inventor's publication contains clear instructions to do or make something that would infringe the patentee's claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee's patent, the patentee's claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCAFC 70">169 In Apotex Pty Ltd (formerly Genrx Pty Ltd) v Sanofi-Aventis [2008] FCA 1194 ; (2008) 78 IPR 485 , Gyles J analysed the cases in which the principles of novelty have been applied, commencing with Hill v Evans [1862] EngR 365 ; (1862) 1A IPR 1. In summary, his Honour relevantly observed as follows:
 
&#8226; The expression "enabling disclosure" was brought to prominence in Biogen Inc v Medeva plc [1996] UKHL 18 ; (1996) 36 IPR 438 , a decision that did not concern anticipation but whether a later patent was "supported" by an earlier specification. &#8226; Enabling disclosure may relate to the disclosure required for there to be anticipation of a process or method claim but is not relevant to anticipation of a product claim or a claim for a chemical compound by formula.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] APO 23">This approach is supported in Apotex Pty Ltd (formerly GenRx Pty Ltd) v Sanofi-Aventis [2008] FCA 1194 where it was said (in [119]---[120]):
 
"[119] ... In NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 15 ; (1995) 183 CLR 655 at 664 the High Court quoted with approval the following passage from the NRDC Case [1959] HCA 67 ; 102 CLR 252 at 261---262 per Dixon CJ, Kitto and Windeyer JJ: 
 
 
"the Commissioner may properly reject a claim for a process which is not within the concept of a "manufacture". But the case cited [ie Microcell] shows also that even if the process is within the concept the Commissioner is not bound to accept the allegation of the applicant that it is new, if it is apparent on the face of the specification, when properly construed, that the allegation is unfounded". [120] The latter decision has subsequently been discussed by the High Court in Advanced Building Systems Pty Ltd v Ramset Fasteners (Aust) Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 19 ; (1998) 194 CLR 171 , particularly at [36]---[40] per Brennan CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ and in Lockwood Security Products [2007] HCA 21 ; 235 ALR 202 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1070 at [106] ---[107].
