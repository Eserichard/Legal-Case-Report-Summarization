<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 156">2 The appellant, Vawdrey Australia Pty Ltd which was the second trailer manufacturer, appeals against the findings of the primary judge in relation to copyright infringement, the quantum of damages and the costs in Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage &amp; Distribution Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 803 (30 May 2008, liability judgment), in Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage &amp; Distribution Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 1493 (9 October 2008, quantum judgment) and in Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage &amp; Distribution Pty Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 1592 (28 October 2008, costs judgment). The three judgments reflect the primary judge's three staged approach to the proceedings. There was a hearing on liability, a hearing on damages, and written submissions on costs and reasons for judgment published at each stage.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1592">
 This was a copyright infringement and breach of confidence case in which I previously delivered reasons for decision finding in favour of the applicant, Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd ("Krueger"), on the issues of both liability and quantum: Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage &amp; Distribution Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 803 (liability judgment) and Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage &amp; Distribution Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1493 (quantum judgment). The reader's familiarity with those earlier reasons is assumed for present purposes. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1493">2 There was a hearing on liability in March 2008. Reasons for decision were published on 30 May 2008: Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 803 ("the reasons for decision"). I found that as a result of Camerons' unauthorised disclosure of confidential information of Krueger to Vawdrey, Camerons misused that confidential information: at [87]-[119]. In addition, I found that Camerons authorised the infringement of Krueger's copyright in the Krueger Drawings (as defined in [3] of the reasons for decision) and Vawdrey infringed Krueger's copyright in those drawings: at [120]-[136]. </sentence>
