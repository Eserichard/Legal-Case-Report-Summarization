<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 771">Ordinarily, the more serious the consequences of what is contested in the litigation, the more a court will have regard to the strength and weakness of evidence before it in coming to a conclusion. 
 

 
 
 [31] Even though he spoke of the common law position, Dixon J's classic discussion in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 361-363 of how the civil standard of proof operates appositely expresses the considerations which s 140(2) of the Evidence Act now requires a court to take into account ... 
 

 
The same standard applies in a proceeding of the present kind: cf. GTS Freight Management Pty Limited v Transport Workers Union of Australia [1990] FCA 78 ; (1990) 25 FCR 296 at 301 per Keely J; Standen v Feehan [2008] FCA 1009 at [20] , 175 IR 297 at 300 per Lander J.  A person can intentionally hinder or obstruct another person, it has been said, by an active act or by conduct which is essentially negative in character: cf. Standen v Feehan [2008] FCA 1009 at [21] , 175 IR 297 at 300 per Lander J. Pincus J gave the term " obstruct[ion] ", then appearing in s 125(10) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth), the same meaning in Nicol v Parr (1985) 11 IR 141 (at 143 to 144). In so concluding, Pincus J drew support as follows from a decision concerning the obstruction of a police officer: 
 
 Next, it was contended that some more positive action than that proved is necessary to constitute obstruction within the meaning of the statute. It was said that, in particular, merely requiring Mr Nicol to leave is insufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 865">So far as Part 15 of the Act is concerned the only penalty proceeding involving a contravention of the right of entry provisions is Standen v Feehan [2008] FCA 1009 ; (2008) 175 IR 297 per Lander J (as to the contravening conduct) and [2008] FCA 1574 ; (2008) 177 IR 276 (as to the penalty decision). Mr Feehan was an official of the CFMEU although the CFMEU was not a party to the proceeding. Mr Feehan in exercising powers of entry to premises under ss 285B and 285C of the Act intentionally hindered and obstructed a person in contravention of s 285E of the Act. A penalty of $1,300.00 was imposed on Mr Feehan. The maximum penalty was $2,000.00. As to questions of broader principle, Lander J considered at [16] of the penalty decision that punishment played some part in formulating a penalty for a contravention of the right of entry provisions but rehabilitation played no real part. Lander J was dealing with the imposition of a penalty on the individuals. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 786">The next question that arises is: Did the CFMEU, AMWU or CEPU by reason of the conduct of their officials on 13 February 2009 and/or 5 March 2009 contravene s 767(1) or s 768(1) of the Act? These provisions are civil remedy provisions for the purposes of the Act (ss 767(2) and 768(3)) and the Court may order a person who has contravened either provision to pay a pecuniary penalty. Accordingly, the contravening conduct must be established to the standard of proof required by Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 and the Court is required to take into account the nature of the cause of action or defence; the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding; and the gravity of the matters alleged (s 140(2) Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)). The Briginshaw standard of proof should be applied to all questions of fact in controversy ( Pine v Doyle (2005) 143 IR 98 ; [2005] FCA 977 , per Merkel J; Standen v Feehan [2008] FCA 1009 ; (2008) 175 IR 297 per Lander J; [2008] FCA 1009). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1574">18 I do not intend to recite the facts which I have found and which are contained in my reasons in Standen v Feehan [2008] FCA 1009. Those facts speak for themselves.</sentence>
