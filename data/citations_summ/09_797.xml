<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 603">In his response filed on 22 December 2009, the first respondent opposed the application for an extension of time. The response referred to the case of SZMNO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 797. In that decision, Barker J referred to the well known remarks of Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen, Minister for Home Affairs &amp; Environment [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 , which set out a number of relevant considerations in extension of time applications. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 211">Turning to the merits of the application, if the Court determines that the substantive application is without merit, an extension of time may be refused. [12] This is because where, as here, a substantive right is vested in a party as a consequence of judgment, or in this case decision, and the time in which to appeal or apply further has gone, the time for appealing or making the application will not be extended unless the proposed appeal or application has some prospects of success, nor if it is hopeless, unarguable or bound to fail. [13] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1075">If the Court determines that the substantive application is without merit, then an extension of time may be refused. [28] This is because where, as here, a substantive right has vested in a party as a consequence of judgment (or in this case decision) and the time in which to appeal or apply further has gone, " the time for appealing [for making the application] will not be extended unless the proposed appeal [application] has some prospects of success " [29] nor, if it is " hopeless, unarguable or bound to fail. " [30] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1237">The principles to be applied in considering an application for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal were discussed by the Full Court (per Lockhart, Sheppard and Burchett JJ) in Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187. Order 52, r 15(2) provides a flexible discretion to the Court as to what will constitute a "special reason" for the grant of an extension of time. Generally, it is accepted that the following factors should be considered: the integrity of the time limits; the adequacy of the explanation for the delay; questions of prejudice to a respondent, although mere lack of prejudice is not sufficient for leave to be granted; and the merits of the substantial application. See SZMNO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 797 and authorities referred to at [12] --- [15]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 747">In the recent decision of SZMNO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [7] , which was an application seeking an extension for filing an appeal against a decision of a Federal Magistrate, Barker J at [14] followed the decision of Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [8] , where his Honour held at 348-349 that five factors should be considered in determining whether relief ought to be given: 
 (a) Applications for an extension of time are not to be granted unless it is proper to do so; the legislative time limits are not to be ignored. 
 
 (b) There must be some acceptable explanation for the delay. 
 
 (c) Any prejudice to the respondent in defending the proceedings, caused by the delay, is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension. 
 
 (d) The mere absence of prejudice to the respondent is not enough to justify the grant of an extension. 
 
 (e) The merits of the substantial application are to be taken into account in considering whether an extension is to be granted.
