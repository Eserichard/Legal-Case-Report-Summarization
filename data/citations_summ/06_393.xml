<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 996">On the point of inaccurate information included within an application Bennett J in SZGJO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 393 held that: "The applicant authorised and caused his migration agent to fill in the visa application form on his behalf. While he did not specifically authorise the inclusion of incorrect or incomplete information as in NAWZ, s.98 applies. Section 98 does not require a covert purpose to mislead. The Federal Magistrate was not in error in finding that, in the circumstances, the visa application was valid. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 816">In cases where a migration agent lodges an application with the knowledge and consent of a person, the application constitutes a valid application, even if it contains incorrect information or false documentation. [11] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1024">Section 48A(1) applies to it. " 

Although I think that the instant cases are on all fours with NAWZ and for that reason I am unable to provide the applicants with the declarations they seek, Mr Karp argues that if I am wrong NAWZ is limited to a case where there was a specific authorisation. He says that the same applies to BAL v Minister for Immigration [2002] FCAFC 198 at [41] and [42] and draws comfort from SZGJO v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 393 at [16] :
 
 "The appellant authorised and caused his migration agent to fill in the visa application form on his behalf. While he did not specifically authorise the inclusion of incorrect or incomplete information as in NAWZ s.98 applies. Section 98 does not require a covert purpose to mislead.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 323">Driver FM found that the protection visa application made on behalf of the applicant was valid. On appeal, Bennett J found that Driver FM was not in error in finding that, in the circumstances, the visa application was valid (see SZGJO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [15] at [16]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 320">I am not satisfied that the applicant has shown, or would be able to show, that he made a valid application to the Refugee Review Tribunal. Accordingly, the Tribunal would have had no jurisdiction to conduct a review (ss.412(2) and 414 (1) of the Migration Act ; see also SZGJO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [12] ; SZMGX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [13] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 254">Regulation 2.07 only requires substantial compliance with the directions in form 866 not strict compliance; Bal v Minister for Immigration [2002] FCAFC 189 ; (2002) 189 ALR 566 ; SZGJO v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 393. In NAWZ v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCAFC 199 at [16] the Full Bench, Finn, Mansfield and Stone JJ dealing with an application which was substantially false in its contents and carried two false declarations signed by a person who was in reality the appellant's alter ego, being a false application, was " in formal terms, a valid application". At [17] the court said: "We do not consider that the requirement in regulation 2.07 that the approved form be completed " in accordance with any directions on it " necessitates that any departure from those directions spells invalidity for an application. It is unlikely to have been the purpose of the legislation cf Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 , 390 --- 391. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 1529">It was further submitted on behalf of the Minister that if the review application was made without the applicant's authority, the application was not valid and the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to conduct a review (Migration Act, ss.412(2) and 414 (1); see also SZGJO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [19] and SZLHP per Graham J). Even if the Tribunal's jurisdiction were affected by jurisdictional error, the Court should not require the Tribunal to conduct a review of the delegate's decision. 
  I am not satisfied that the applicant has made a valid application to the Refugee Review Tribunal. Accordingly, the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to conduct a review (ss.412(2) and 414 (1) of the Migration Act ; see also SZGJO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [25] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 359">I agree with Mr Johnson's submission that it cannot be that an Applicant's own fraud or a fraud to which he is a party would result in the Tribunal's decision being set aside. It would be absurd if all knowingly false claims were incapable of being the subject of a valid refusal. ( NAWZ at [118]; SZHTW v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [18] ; SZGJO v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [19] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 1338">18 The Federal Magistrate held that reg 2.07 only requires substantial compliance with the directions in Form 866, not strict compliance (cf Bal v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 189 ; (2002) 189 ALR 566 ; SZGJO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 393). The Federal Magistrate held that significantly more than the "bare bones" of the appellant's claims were provided with the protection visa application and that there had therefore been substantial compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FMCA 1349">29. After the hearing, and in response to a request from the court, the first respondent filed further written submissions in relation to authorities concerning the effect of s.98 of the Act as follows: 
 
 
 The decision of Smith FM in Shen v MIMIA [2004] FMCA 693 deals with section 98. At paragraph [3], His Honour stated that: 
 
 
 
 
 The delegate's decision, which was affirmed by the Tribunal, applied a power conferred by s.109 of the Migration Act after deciding that " there was non-compliance by the holder of a visa " and after " having regard to " the list of discretionary considerations prescribed in Migration Regulation 2.41. The allegation of "non-compliance" which was found to be established was a failure to comply with the requirement of s.101 that " a non-citizen must fill in his or her application form in such a way that ... no incorrect answers are given . " The effect of ss.98, 100 and 111 is that a breach of this obligation can occur if an application form is filled in by someone else on behalf of the applicant, even if the applicant did not know that the answer was incorrect, and whether the non-compliance was deliberate or inadvertent. ... 
 
 
 
 
 The other cases that refer to section 98 include: SZGJO v MIMIA [2006] FCA 393 ; NAWZ v MIMIA [2004] FCAFC 199 at [17] ; SZHLY v MIMIA [2006] FMCA 771 at [28] ; SZHTW v MIMIA [2006] FCA 1086 at [26] ; and SZBIV v MIMIA [2006] FCA 56 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FMCA 657">This was done in this case. 22. It is also the case that regulation 2.07 requires substantial compliance with the directions on the form, not strict compliance ( Bal v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 189 ; (2002) 189 ALR 566 ; NAWZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 199 ; SZGJO v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 393 ; see also section 25C of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 ). 
 Inclusion of all applicant's claims for protection
 
 23. The applicant submits that the protection visa application did not cover all of her claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2006] FCA 1408">To the contrary, in the ordinary course, the instruction to the agent to submit "all the matters on my behalf" would include the completion of the application form and lodgement of the application with the Tribunal. Similar instructions have been found to give rise to an authority to sign a protection visa application ( SZGJO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 393 at [7] ). On the basis of the evidence before me, and in circumstances where the applicant gave that general authority and expected it to result in an appearance before the Tribunal, I am satisfied that the agent's authority extended to an authorisation to sign the application form on her behalf.  An application to the Tribunal for review must be in the approved form (s 412(1)(a) of the Act). Accepting the applicant's evidence that the signature on the application form was not hers, a question arises as to the status of the application to the Tribunal. It may be that an application must be signed personally by an applicant to be in approved form. If the application was defective for this reason, the applicant had not applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision. The Tribunal then had no jurisdiction to hear the application. It would follow that an appeal to this Court alleging a failure by the Tribunal to give notice of the hearing and failure by the Federal Magistrate to make that finding does not arise and the application for an extension of time to appeal should be refused ( SZGJO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 393 at [4] to [5]). </sentence>
