<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWSC 975">45 On the first day the matter was before me ex parte, 12 May 2009, I alerted the plaintiff's counsel to the fact that a new regime had come into force, without expressly mentioning s 128A of the Act (tr 6). I have little doubt that had the parties addressed the s 128A regime in their Consent Orders, any confusion in respect of the steps to be taken would have been dispelled. However the defendants, to their credit, made an admission of contempt subject to the preliminary application with which I dealt in the Judgment. A great deal happened between 15 May 2009 and 9 July 2009 in respect of the main case. The defendants made a large amount of material available to Mr Feldman so that it could be produced to the solicitors for the plaintiff. The defendants were also winding down their business, moving out of premises and terminating the employment of approximately 17 employees. There was also the application by Beautree in the Federal Court of Australia for the appointment of provisional liquidators to Willow Glade Pty Ltd and Pazoluca Pty Ltd, the fifth and sixth defendants in the main proceedings. Those applications were heard on 7 and 8 July 2009 and judgment was delivered on 9 July 2009: Beautree Pty Ltd, in the matter of Willow Glade Pty Ltd v Willow Glade Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 738. </sentence>
