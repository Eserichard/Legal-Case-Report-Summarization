<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 646">12 Part 4, Division 1C of the Act provides that some or all of the parties involved in a Native Title proceeding may negotiate an agreed outcome for that application or part of that application. The Court is empowered to make orders by consent in native title matters where agreement is reached between parties on the terms of the orders. Section 87A of the Act provides, among other things, that if at any stage of the proceedings after the close of notification, agreement is reached on a proposed determination of native title in relation to an area included in the area covered by the application, the Court may make an order in, or consistent with, the proposed determination of native title without holding a hearing if the Court is satisfied that the proposed determination for that area is within power and that it would be appropriate to make the order.
