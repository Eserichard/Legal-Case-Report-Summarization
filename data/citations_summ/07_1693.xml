<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCAFC 191">7 The primary judge was of the opinion that, when a valid surrender determination is made under s 22(2) of the Act, mandatory statutory provisions then operate for the implementation of the extradition process. Pursuant to s 23 of the Act, a warrant must issue for the surrender of the person. He was of opinion that, following a valid surrender determination, there was no further decision to be made by the Minister in relation to which a writ of prohibition could apply. There was no scope for the application of the doctrine of legitimate expectation in that statutory process. There was no separate basis for the grant of injunctive relief ( Rivera [2007] FCA 1693 at [21] ---[24] and [34]).  2 On 13 September 2007 the appellant sought a writ of prohibition and injunctive relief pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) to restrain the Minister from taking or causing to be taken any action under the surrender warrant pursuant to s 23 of the Act. That application was dismissed by a judge of this Court on 14 November 2007 ( Rivera v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 1693). This is an appeal from that decision. 6 The grounds were apparently clarified at the hearing and the primary judge summarised them in Rivera [2007] FCA 1693 at [8] . Those grounds do not refer to the second basis which I have identified from the affidavit, that is, the basis depending upon the existence of other proceedings and there does not appear to be any express reference to that argument in the balance of the judgment. </sentence>
