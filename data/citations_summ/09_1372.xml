<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 535">In this instance the applicant submitted that the Tribunal should have expressly raised with the applicant the question of whether corroborative material was available to support her claim about the purchase of land for the purpose of construction of a meeting house. The applicant relied on the approach of Perram J in SZMUK and Others v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2009) 112 ALD 295 ; [2009] FCA 1372. The applicant submitted that Perram J had found that where the Tribunal's reasoning was based upon the absence of evidence on an issue, that made the question of whether evidence existed an issue in the SZBEL sense and that if an applicant was not given the opportunity to present evidence to meet that deficiency the hearing was unfair in the sense considered in SZBEL . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 297">Section s 424AA provides the following:

 If an applicant is appearing before the Tribunal because of an invitation under section 425: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the Tribunal may orally give to the applicant clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; and 
 

 
 
 (b) if the Tribunal does so---the Tribunal must: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the applicant understands why the information is relevant to the review, and the consequences of the information being relied on in affirming the decision that is under review; and 
 (ii) orally invite the applicant to comment on or respond to the information; and 
 (iii) advise the applicant that he or she may seek additional time to comment on or respond to the information; and 
 (iv) if the applicant seeks additional time to comment on or respond to the information---adjourn the review, if the Tribunal considers that the applicant reasonably needs additional time to comment on or respond to the information.
