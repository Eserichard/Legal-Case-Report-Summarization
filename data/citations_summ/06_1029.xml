<sentence id="cs0" from="[2006] FCA 1408">The application was filed approximately 3 weeks outside the 21 day time limit prescribed by the Federal Court Rules (O 52 r 15(1)(a)(i)). No explanation for the delay is given, other than an assertion by the applicant that she believed that the time limit had not expired. That explanation does not constitute special reasons for the grant of an extension of time. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to consider the merits of the appeal in determining whether leave should be granted ( NBBD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1029 at [12] ).
