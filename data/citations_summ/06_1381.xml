<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 634">In relation to the respondent's contentions, as the respondent acknowledged, on our understanding of the authorities, it is not clearly established that the doctrines of Anshun estoppel and issue estoppel operate in the context of AAT proceedings [100] . However regardless of whether these doctrines are applicable, we accept that s 33 of the AAT Act gives us power to control our own procedures and s 25(4A) gives us power to limit the questions of fact, the evidence and the issues that we consider. It is also well established on the authorities that one consequence of these powers is that we have a discretion as to whether we will entertain or consider again, issues which have already been determined between the same parties by a previous decision of the Tribunal. We also acknowledge that the applicable authorities are to the effect that the Tribunal should general not allow "re-litigation" of issues previously decided, at least in the absence of compelling fresh evidence [101] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 833">The background of this proceeding was helpfully summarised by Weinberg J in Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment &amp; Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1381 ; (2006) 235 ALR 297 at [14] - [17] : Mr Singh and Ms Kaur sought review of Centrelink's decision of 4 November 1999 on the basis that, although formally married, they had been living separately under one roof from about 1996. On 23 December 1999, Centrelink decided that Mr Singh and Ms Kaur were to be treated as members of a couple. On 21 January 2000, an authorised review officer affirmed the decision of 23 December 1999. The Secretaries rely on the proceedings instituted by Mr Singh dealt with by the following reasons for judgment: Singh v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2000] Unreported V912 of 2000 (Finklestein J); Singh v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2001] FCA 1281 (Beaumont , Kiefel and Hely JJ); Singh v Secretary to the Department of Family and Community Services [2003] FMCA 566 (Hartnett FM); Singh v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2004] FCA 1685 ; (2004) 142 FCR 232 (Gray J); Singh v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services (Centrelink) [2005] HCATrans 759 (Hayne and Callinan JJ); Singh v Secretary of Family and Community Services [2005] FCA 1625 (Gray J); Singh v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 189 (Ryan J); Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1381 ; (2006) 235 ALR 297 (Weinberg J); Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCAFC 174 (Dowsett , Siopis and Middleton JJ); Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] HCASL 224 (Gummow and Kiefel JJ); Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1061 (Middleton J); Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2008] FCA 1463 (Goldberg J); Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCAFC 59 (Spender , Lander and Flick JJ); Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] HCASL 194 (Gummow and Kiefel JJ).  The background to this proceeding was also helpfully summarised by Weinberg J in [2006] FCA 1381 ; (2006) 235 ALR 297 at [20] - [21] : Following further requests from Mr Singh, Centrelink wrote to him on 22 January 2002 stating that it had reviewed his case and decided not to change its decision to recover a compensation debt of $88,633.34. Mr Singh asked that the matter be referred to an authorised review officer. On 4 February 2002, an authorised review officer informed Mr Singh that he had no power to review the matter as it had already been reviewed by the SSAT, as well as the tribunal itself. Mr Singh then lodged a further application with the SSAT on 19 February 2002. The SSAT decided on 13 May 2002 to again affirm the decision under review. Mr Singh then lodged a further appeal to the tribunal, which on 17 December 2002 affirmed the decision of the SSAT dated 13 May 2002. On 2 January 2003, Mr Singh appealed to the Federal Court seeking to set aside the tribunal's decision of 17 December 2002. On 19 March 2003, I ordered that Mr Singh's application be transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court.  Mr Singh then appealed the AAT decision to the Federal Court. That appeal was dismissed by Weinberg J on 23 October 2006: Singh and Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1381 ; (2006) 235 ALR 297 at [38] - [56].  The original debt was incurred in the following circumstances which were helpfully summarised by Weinberg J at [8]-[13] in Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment &amp; Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1381: Mr Singh was born in 1950. He was employed by the Public Transport Corporation from 1983, initially as a tram conductor, and later as a tram driver. On 2 January 1991, Mr Singh suffered a work-related injury, which resulted in an ongoing medical condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 799"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 853">It is quite clear that Anshun estoppel can have operation within the Tribunal. So much has been authoritatively determined in Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment &amp; Workplace [6] . There the respondent had made a decision in November 1999 to recover from compensation payments payable to Mr Singh, amounts of social security payments totalling $88,633.34 that had earlier been made to Mr Singh and his spouse. That decision was reviewed internally and by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and this Tribunal (in October 2000).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCAFC 59">9 Justice Weinberg dismissed allegations of fraud made by the appellant as lacking substance and on the principle in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589: Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1381 ; (2006) 95 ALD 569. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] AATA 31">Decisions of that type, that is, to dismiss an application and direct that a person must not without leave of the Tribunal make any subsequent application, would only be made unless it is clear that there is no real question to be tried because litigants are not to be deprived the right to submit genuine controversies for determination (refer decisions summarised in Paramasivam v Randwick City Council [2005] FCA 369 at paragraph 29). A very useful summary of the operation of s 42B of the AAT Act is found in Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1381 ( Singh) where at paragraph 49 Weinberg J decided that whilst s 42B of the AAT Act differed from Order 21 of the Federal Court Rules (that is, the Tribunal legislation does not require that the person act habitually and persistently ) it was implicit that a Direction under s 42B(1)(b) will not be lightly made and will normally require some element of habitual or persistent conduct (paragraph 49). At paragraph 50 His Honour decided: 
 
 . . . In accordance with established authority the Tribunal was entitled to have regard to Mr Singh's entire dealings with Centrelink including his numerous applications to have that decision reviewed. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1463">7 The matter before Weinberg J in respect of which he delivered his judgment and made orders on 23 October 2006, Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment &amp; Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1381 ; (2006) 235 ALR 297 , was an appeal by the applicant from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 3 July 2006 dismissing, as frivolous and vexatious, the applicant's application for review of a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal on 22 March 2006. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal also directed that the applicant not, without leave of the Tribunal, make any future application with respect to recovery of sickness allowance, disability support pension or wife pension paid between 28 October 1991 and 26 October 1999. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCAFC 174">11 This is an appeal by Mohinder Singh from a decision handed down on 23 October 2006 by Weinberg J ( Singh v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1381). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] AATA 1085">As it happens, there is a helpful discussion by Weinberg J. in Singh [16] of the principles that guide the exercise of the discretion. His Honour said: 
"... it is implicit in the section that a direction under s 42B(1)(b) will not be lightly made and will normally require some element of habitual or persistent conduct. "
  Even if it were to be assumed (contrary to my view) that there was merit in the matters that the applicant now seeks to agitate, his argument is met by the estoppel discussed in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [6] .
