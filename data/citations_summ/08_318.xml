<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 49">(10) The taxpayer may lead evidence that it would have undertaken a particular activity, or adopted a particular course in lieu of the scheme. If a taxpayer has given evidence of what he or she would have done but for entering the scheme, that evidence will be relevant and useful to the extent to which it reveals facts or matters that bear upon the objective determination of the alternative postulate: Trail Bro s at [36]; AXA Asia Pacific Holdings at [139]; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Mochkin [2003] FCAFC 15 ; (2003) 127 FCR 185 at 209 --- 210. (11) The taxpayer can give evidence as to what it would have done in the absence of the scheme, provided foundation facts are given to support what would otherwise be a bald speculative statement: McCutcheon v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 318 ; (2008) 168 FCR 149 at 163 --- 164; AXA Asia Pacific Holdings at [140]. The actual rejection of some alternatives is relevant
 
 (12) The taxpayer's actual rejection of an alternative at the relevant time will be important evidence in determining what would have been expected to have occurred: Spotless Services at 422, 424; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Limited (1995) 62 FCR 244 at 284 --- 285. In Spotless Services , the Court considered that the taxpayer's actual rejection of one alternative to the scheme to be relevant to its conclusion that only one alternative remained open to the taxpayer.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 134">140 As Greenwood J stated in McCutcheon v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 318 ; (2008) 168 FCR 149: 
 
 
 
 [37] It is perfectly clear that a deponent in seeking to demonstrate (and discharge the onus of proof) that an assessment is excessive having regard to a prediction as to whether an amount might reasonably have been included in the assessable income of the taxpayer, cannot simply give evidence that the answer is to be found in the deponent speculating as to what he or she would or would not have done in the absence of the scheme ( WD &amp; HO Wills (Australia) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 65 FCR 298). The Commissioner accepted in the course of argument on the appeal that it is perfectly proper for a deponent in the position of Mr McCutcheon to say in evidence that the trustee (controlled by the taxpayers) would not have made distributions of the amounts postulated by the Commissioner to the taxpayers, provided the foundation for that observation or conclusion is given in evidence. In other words, Mr McCutcheon might have said that "the trustee would never have distributed such a substantial portion to either my wife or I" because (or for that reason that) and then identify factual circumstances which support the proposition. 
 
 

141 The objective facts before the trial judge were that the Underwriting Agreement (see [94] above) and the Equity Sell Down Agreement (see [95] above) would not have been entered into had the scheme not been carried out and the fees payable to MBL under those agreements would have been lost. These objective facts were identified by Mr Facioni and accepted by the trial judge thereby discharging AXA's onus of demonstrating that the Commissioner's alternative postulate "was not sufficiently reliable for it to be regarded as reasonable": McCutcheon [2008] FCA 318 ; 168 FCR 149. The trial judge was entitled to have regard to and rely upon the evidence of Mr Facioni. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 939">The burden of proving that the Commissioner's assessment is excessive falls upon the taxpayer, in this case RCI. As Greenwood J observed in McCutcheon v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 318 ; (2008) 168 FCR 149 at 166, this, 
 
 necessarily involves each taxpayer adducing evidence which would discharge the onus of demonstrating that the Commissioner's prediction or hypothesis was not sufficiently reliable for it to be regarded as reasonable. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] QCAT 109">The Appellant in his Outline rightly points out that this Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence and may inform itself of anything in the way it considers appropriate. It is submitted that s 23 of the MTA does not release the Tribunal from an obligation to apply rules of law in arriving at its decision. He further submits by reference to a decision of McCutcheon &amp; Anor v The Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 318 ; (2008) 168 FCR 149 that this Tribunal should only refer to relevant evidence when coming to a conclusion about the facts in issue. This issue is considered later in the Decision. </sentence>
