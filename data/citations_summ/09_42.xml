<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 303">In Re Gordon Grant and Grant at [317], McPherson J said that the test in such a case is whether a departure from the proof of debt proceedings is warranted (see also Vagrand Pty Ltd (in liq) v Fielding (1993) 41 FCR 550 [555] and Swaby v Lift Capital Partners Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 749 [24]). The requirement for leave (under whatever may be the applicable statutory provision in the relevant case) ensures that a company in liquidation does not face a multiplicity of legal proceedings that are expensive, time consuming and potentially unnecessary ( Altinova Nominees Pty Ltd v Leveraged Capital Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (in liq) [2009] FCA 42 [17 - 19]). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 597">His Honour helpfully listed the following relevant authorities: Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd [1983] 2 Qd R 314 at 317; Commonwealth v Davis Samuel Pty Ltd (No 5) [2008] ACTSC 124 at [30] , [32]; Lawless v Mackendrick (No 2) [2008] WASC 15 at [35] ; Altinova Nominees Pty Ltd v Leveraged Capital Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (in liq) (No 2) [2009] FCA 42 ; Ingot Capital Investments Pty Ltd and Ors v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets Pty Ltd and Ors [2004] NSWSC 406. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1425">The principles applicable to the grant of leave, pursuant to s 500(2) CA, or in similar positions of insolvency, are canvassed in a number of authorities, which are collected, very conveniently, by Jacobson J in Altinova Nominees Pty Ltd v Leveraged Capital Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) (No 2) [2009] FCA 42 (at [17]-[23] of that decision. In Goodman v Glenhurst Corporation Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1482 , Finkelstein J took the view that the Court is required to be satisfied that the applicant's claim was sufficiently serious to be allowed to proceed. The underlying theory for that was that the liquidator should not be vexed with the obligation to fight a hopeless case and incur unnecessary expenditure. His Honour went on to consider the details involved in that proceeding and noted that he had not formed any firm view about the merits but was satisfied that the claim in that instance, both on behalf of the applicant and the then respondent, for indemnity against the insurer, had a solid foundation. Nevertheless, he anticipated that the claims would be hotly disputed. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 749">Accordingly, s 471B of the Corporations Act prohibits a person beginning or continuing a proceeding against a company in liquidation except with the leave of the Court. The provision ensures that a company in liquidation does not face a multiplicity of legal proceedings that are expensive, time consuming, and potentially unnecessary: Altinova Nominees Pty Ltd v Leveraged Capital Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (in liq) [2009] FCA 42 at [17] to [19].  See generally: Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty Ltd at 317; Commonwealth v Davis Samuel Pty Ltd at [30], [32]; Lawless v Mackendrick (No 2) [2008] WASC 15 at [35] ; Altinova Nominees Pty Ltd v Leveraged Capital Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (in liq) (No 2) [2009] FCA 42 ; Ingot Capital Investments Pty Ltd and Ors v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets Pty Ltd and Ors [2004] NSWSC 406. </sentence>
