<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 1">
 It is necessary to consider as a preliminary issue whether the bankruptcy notice failed to comply with the Bankruptcy Act and hence was defective or irregular, having regard to the operation of s.25C of the Acts Interpretation Act in relation to substantial compliance and all the circumstances of the case. If there is such a defect or irregularity it is then necessary to determine whether the defect or irregularity is "formal" within s.306(1) (see Irani v Hollyburton UK Ltd [2007] FCA 1447 ; (2007) 163 FCR 329 at [14] --- [17]). That question involves two levels of enquiry (see Irani , Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122 ; (2007) 157 FCR 313 per Jacobson J, Kleinwort Benson Australia Limited v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; [1988] HCA 34 ; (1988) 165 CLR 71 at [15] per Mason CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Gaudron JJ and Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 228 CLR 409 at [25] ff). The relevant enquiry at that point is whether the bankruptcy notice fails to meet a requirement made essential by the Bankruptcy Act or whether it could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice (in which case it is a nullity whether or not the debtor is in fact misled). In Irani at [17] Middleton J stressed that these two aspects need to be addressed separately. The High Court said in Adams v Lambert at [18] that if there is a defect or irregularity in a bankruptcy notice, the first question is whether the defect or irregularity is a formal one within the meaning of s.306 of the Act: see also Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122 ; (2007) 157 FCR 313 at [29]- [31]. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 1425">The live issue was therefore whether the set off could have been raised in the proceedings. His Honour concluded that they could not because the relevant proceedings for the purposes of his decision were the proceedings in the District Court whereby the judgment was registered. His Honour took the view, which he believed was consistent with decisions of the Federal Court in Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122 ; Re Franks; Franks v Warringah Council [2003] FCA 1047 that: "[46] The result of the present Application, it is considered, can be stated simply. For the purposes of the present Application, it was accepted that the joint venture agreement as between the Applicant and the Respondent gave rise to losses, those losses being said to be approximately $160,000. Those losses obviously exceed the judgment debt of $77,498.96.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1452">35 It is not considered that the " final judgment or final order " could be constituted by the order for costs made by the Supreme Court, either on its own or together with the Certificate of Determination of Costs : Franks v Warringah Council [2003] FCA 1047 , 131 FCR 287. A certificate that sets out the determination of the costs assessor, without being filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, is not sufficient to found a bankruptcy notice: Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122 at [53] , [2007] FCA 122 ; 157 FCR 313 at 319 per Jacobson J. In Franks , the Land and Environment Court had there ordered that the Council's costs be agreed or assessed under the then Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW). A bankruptcy notice was served, the schedule to which stated that costs had been so assessed and annexed a certificate.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 427">20 Mr Snelgrove appealed to this Court against Driver FM's judgment of 6 June 2006. On 15 February 2007, Jacobson J allowed the appeal, set aside his Honour's orders and remitted the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court to be determined in accordance with Jacobson J's reasons for judgment (see Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCA 1447">42 Justice North did not have the advantage of the reasoning in the subsequent cases referred to in this judgment, particularly Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 ; Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; 109 FCR 33 and Snelgrove [2007] FCA 122 ; 157 FCR 313. With the benefit of the reasoning in these decisions, North J would have needed to have undertaken an analysis of the failure to comply with note 2 of the Schedule to the form in the context of the Act to determine whether it was an essential requirement. Merely equating such a failure to a failure to attach a copy of the judgment to the bankruptcy notice without the further analysis now required, would not be sufficient. In the circumstances, I do not regard the decision of North J as one I should follow. In any event, the circumstances of the case before me are quite different from those confronting his Honour, for he did not have a binding determination of the Supreme Court of Victoria declaring the amount of interest payable which was the basis of the interest claimed in the bankruptcy notice. 14 In order to determine the issues in this appeal, it is useful to refer to the recent decision of Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122 ; (2007) 157 FCR 313. In that case, Jacobson J considered whether an incorrect reference to the legislation, which was the statutory source of post-judgment interest claimed in the bankruptcy notice, resulted in the bankruptcy notice being invalid. In determining the correct principles to apply, his Honour held (at [29]-[31]):
 
 The High Court said in Adams [ v Lambert (2006)] [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 at [18] that if there is a failure to comply with a provision of the Act or the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 Cth (the Regulations), the first question which must be asked is whether the defect or irregularity is a formal one within the purview of s 306. If it is, it is then necessary to ask whether substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and whether the injustice cannot be remedied by an order of the Court. It must be borne in mind that these are separate and distinct questions. 
 
 The first question, that is, whether the defect or irregularity is formal, involves two levels of enquiry. These were stated by an earlier decision of the High Court in Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; (1988) 165 CLR 71 , and applied in Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 at [25] ff. 
 
 The relevant enquiry is: does the bankruptcy notice fail to meet a requirement made essential by the Act or the Regulations; or could it reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice; see Kleinwort Benson 165 CLR at 79; Adams 225 ALR 396 at [25]. </sentence>
