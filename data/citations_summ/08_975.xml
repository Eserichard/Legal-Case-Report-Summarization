<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1196">4 On 24 June 2008, I again adjourned the hearing of UKL's application and directed that UKL write to its members advising them of new information which had come into existence since the meeting of members which had approved the Scheme. As set out in my reasons for decision, I made those directions because I was of the view that the new information was material and that members should have an opportunity to oppose the making of final orders after the disclosure of the new information ( Re Uranium King Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 975). </sentence>
