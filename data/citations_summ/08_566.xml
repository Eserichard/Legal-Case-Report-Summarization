<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] AATA 567">Mr Warnock submitted that my decision in Robinson v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [11] supports the position of Senior Member Beddoe in Hooper v Comcare [12] . He also says Hooper is at odds with paragraph 37of the Federal Court of Australia decision of Flick J in Comcare v Davies [13] ; and Comcare v Davies (No. 2) [14] . In Davies, His Honour differentiated the High Court case of Timbers v Nelson (supra) from the subsequent High Court decision in Cage Developments v Schubert [15] . The point of distinction was that actual earnings might in some circumstances be regarded as being the same as "ability to earn".</sentence>
