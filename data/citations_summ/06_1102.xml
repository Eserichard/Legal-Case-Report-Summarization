<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 39">9 At par 6, his Honour said: 
 At a general case management directions hearing convened on Thursday Island on 7 July 2006 the joinder motions were argued. Orders were made for the joinder of MG Kailis Pty Ltd. A motion for the joinder of the Torres Shire Council was heard on that day and dismissed on 18 August 2006 --- Akiba v State of Queensland (No 1) 2006 FCA 1102. A further motion by Mr Pende Gamogab for the Dangaloub-Gizra group at Kupere Village sought his joinder on their behalf. For the reasons that follow, although I consider that Mr Gamogab has an interest which would render him eligible for joinder as a party, I am of the opinion that as a matter of discretion he should not be joined and his motion will be dismissed. The reasons informing the exercise of my discretion in that respect may also affect the position of other PNG nationals who are currently parties to these proceedings . '
