<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 749">It should finally be noted that the Court retains an important and continuing role in managing representative proceedings in the public interest: Johnstone v HIH Ltd [2004] FCA 190. Tamberlin J there said: 
 
 [105] The Court has an important and continuing role in managing representative proceedings in the public interest to rectify any potentially misleading communications to class members or potential class members, in order to ensure that there is no misunderstanding engendered by such communications, particularly when they emanate from legal advisers, as to rights and obligations and procedures to be followed by recipients of such communications. 
 

 
In an appropriate case, an order may thus be made that a correcting notice may be issued to remedy any misstatements that may be made during the course of a proceeding: Jarra Creek Central Packing Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 575.
