<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1680">Some reliance was placed on the decision of Lander J in SBTF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1816 where, on an appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate, His Honour was of the view that there was sufficient evidence before the Tribunal to alert the Tribunal to the fact that an issue of psychological harm was raised by virtue of the contents of a psychological report. In that case, however, the Tribunal had accepted that the applicant concerned had been incarcerated and tortured. He was an adherent of a particular brand of Islam which was subject to persecution in his county of origin, Bahrain. Moreover, he had previously been arrested, detained and tortured. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] RRTA 480">The submission also: reiterates the applicant's protection claims; seeks to reconcile the evidence with respect to the timing of the riots; asserts that the applicant is the applicant is at increased risk of persecution because of her vulnerable mental and physical health, as evidenced by the counselor's report, and relying by analogy on Weheliye v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1222 to make the point that the applicant's particular circumstances must be taken into account in assessing their vulnerability to serious harm; and asserts, similarly, that the applicant's precarious mental and physical health may increase the seriousness of the harm she is at risk of encountering because the differential impact which discriminatory behaviour, for example, would have on such a vulnerable person as the applicant could raise the seriousness of such behaviour to the persecutory, relying on the authority of SBTF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1816. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 954">In my view, the Tribunal also erred in failing to consider whether the second applicant faced a well-founded fear of persecution because of the risk of psychological harm should she be required to return to Fiji. The Federal Court has accepted that psychological harm may be serious harm within the meaning of s.91R(2) of the Migration Act [11] . The Tribunal accepted that the second applicant had been threatened with rape and assaulted. The applicants' representative had submitted to the Tribunal that the second applicant continued to suffer the effects of trauma arising from the assault on her [12] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 2">The Minister filed additional written submissions by leave on 21 December 2007. These related in particular to the issue of interpretation difficulties. Relevantly, those submissions are as follows: Presumably grounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the further amended application are intended to reflect the submissions made orally on the basis of SBTF v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1816 (Lander J). The first respondent repeats the submissions made orally in response on 12 December 2006, relying on WAKZ v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 1065 (French J) at [40-49] and Prahastono v Minister for Immigration (1997) 77 FCR 260 (Hill J) at 269-271. Ground 5 concerns the standard of interpretation at the Tribunal hearing. In oral submissions, Mr Reilly, for the Minister, submitted that the applicant had not identified what the Tribunal should have done differently in relation to the gender guidelines. He submitted that there was no evidence that the applicant felt inhibited and no evidence of anything further he wanted to put before the Tribunal that he felt unable to say. Mr Reilly conceded that the recent decision of the Federal Court in SBTF v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1816 assists the applicant in relation to the first issue of whether an integer of the applicant's claims was overlooked, however, Mr Reilly sought to distinguish this case from SBTF and relies upon the earlier decision of WAKZ v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 1065. To the extent that those decisions cannot be reconciled, I am invited by the Minister to prefer WAKZ . </sentence>
