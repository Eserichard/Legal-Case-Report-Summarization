<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 885">Mr Esplin, in his well-reasoned argument, says that there is no necessity for a court to set aside a bankruptcy notice when it is found to be invalid particularly when it is found to be invalid by virtue of the provisions of s.41(5) because, as it is now clear, Skouloudis v St George Bank Limited [2008] FCA 1765 ; Edmonds J, the effect of the issue of a s.41(5) notice is that the bankruptcy notice is deemed to be invalid from the moment of issue and not from the time of serving the s.41(5) notice. This is not how the Federal Court has dealt with the matter in the past however. Edmonds J set aside the notice in Skouloudis [36] and as that case was one taken on appeal from a decision of my own I feel particularly bound to follow it. But Edmonds J was not alone. The bankruptcy notice, the subject of an overstatement, was also set aside in Seovic Civil Engineering Pty Limited v Groeneveld [1999] FCA 255 ; (1999) 161 ALR 543 (" Seovic ") and in other cases; Croker v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 127 ; Thompson v Metham [1999] FCA 935 ; Re Anthony John Whittet [1990] FCA 225. But, in any event a careful reading of the orders of the Registrar reveals that the notice only needed to be set aside " to the extent necessary ". So that even if I am wrong, the Registrar's order does not seem to me to require any further amendment. This, however, does not mean that Esplins cannot seek review of order 2 relating to the costs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 866">There is a significant dispute between the parties as to the effect of this defect. Mr Hammond would have it that the effect constitutes an overstatement of the amount due in both principal and interest, which was not the subject of a notice under s.41(5) of the Bankruptcy Act from the debtor. Therefore, it can be disregarded. Ms Saunders says that this is not a mere overstatement; it is the basing of a bankruptcy notice, at least in part, upon a non-existent obligation which has the effect of invalidating the notice. She further argues that the notice is invalidated because of the non-compliance with the Act and schedules and because the error renders the notice confusing in the manner considered by the High Court in Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; (1998) 165 CLR 71. Mr Hammond seeks the Court's indulgence to amend the notice so as to delete this claim. He argues this can be done provided notice under s.41(5) has not been issued because the effect of a notice under that section is to render the notice invalid as from the date of issue; Skouloudis v St George Bank Ltd [2008] FCA 1765 at [25] . In this case, following receipt of Mr Hammond's submissions, Ms Saunders filed a notice under s.41(5). Mr Hammond asks that the Court allow his amendment as if it was made upon receipt of his submissions and, therefore, prior to the issue of the s.41(5) notice. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 193">In Skouloudis v St George Bank Ltd (2008) 173 FCR 236 ; [2008] FCA 1765 Edmonds J held that if proper notice of an overstatement under s.41(5) of the Act has been given the bankruptcy notice is invalid from the time of its issue and cannot be amended or cured. However a bankruptcy notice may be amended or cured in the absence of or prior to a s.41(5) notice being given (where, for example, there was an overstatement due to clerical error that could not reasonably mislead the debtor). Hence it is critical to determine first whether a s.41(5) notice was given. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 161">That brings us to the case of Skouloudis , which is one of the authorities helpfully provided by counsel for Bryantcraft Pty Ltd, and that is Skouloudis v St George Bank . Here I am concerned with the appeal to the Federal Court, constituted by Edmonds J and the citation is [2008] FCA 1765. Edmonds J said at paragraph [35] of the judgment: "If a bankruptcy notice is a nullity and of no effect, it is not a notice under the Act: see Circle Credit Co-Op v Lilikakis - - - (And citation is given) --- "Chandramouli v Wallader", (once again citation is given) It must be a notice under the Act to be subject to the court's power of amendment in s.33(1)(b). In short, I am of the view that the learned Federal Magistrate had no power to cure the invalidity of the Bankruptcy Notice by amendment in reliance on s.33(1)(b) of the Act and that the Bankruptcy Notice should have been set aside. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 1281">No issue was raised as to any defect or irregularity in the form of the bankruptcy notice, except that Mr Singh suggested that because he disputed the amount of the debt claimed in the bankruptcy notice this went to the validity of the bankruptcy notice. In support of that proposition he referred to the decision of the Federal Court in Skouloudis v St George Bank Ltd (2008) 173 FCR 236 ; [2008] FCA 1765. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 418">The creditor contended that notwithstanding such a conclusion the Court had power to amend an invalid bankruptcy notice based on the decision of Raphael FM in Skouloudis v St George Bank Ltd [2008] FMCA 114 ; (2008) 216 FLR 52 which dealt with a bankruptcy notice rendered invalid by reason of a notice pursuant to s.41(5) of the Act. However, on appeal in Skouloudis v St George Bank Limited [2008] FCA 1765 ; [2008] FCA 1765 ; (2008) 173 FCR 236 , Edmonds J found that an invalid bankruptcy notice was a nullity and of no effect and could not be amended pursuant to s.33(1)(b) of the Act as it was not a notice under the Act (ibid at [35] and see Circle Credit Co-op Ltd v Lilikakis [2000] FCA 667 ; (2000) 99 FCR 592 at [10] per Heerey J and Chandramouli v Wallader [2001] FCA 808 at [4] )). </sentence>
