<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 72">1 On 11 May 2006, the Court granted leave to the applicants (together 'Vintage') to join Grant Johnston ('Mr Johnston') as a third respondent to these proceedings: Vintage Developments Pty Ltd v GHD Pty Limited [2006] FCA 531 (' Vintage (No 1) '). Leave to join Mr Johnston was granted because the pleadings disclosed an arguable case against him and I was not satisfied that the pleaded cause of action was outside the limitation period. At issue are the costs of Vintage's notice of motion for leave to effect the joinder. Mr Johnston submits that those costs should be costs awarded in his favour or, in the alternative, costs in the cause. Vintage seeks an order that Mr Johnston pay 50% of its costs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 73">7 One further matter was the subject of extensive submissions. Mr Johnston had been joined to these proceedings pursuant to leave granted by the Court on 11 May 2006 ( Vintage Developments Pty Limited v GHD Pty Limited [2006] FCA 531 (' Vintage (No 1) '). In Vintage (No 2) , Mr Johnston submitted that Vintage's motion was the first time Vintage had applied to the Court for an order to amend the application and statement of claim in a way that pleaded a case against him. It was said to follow, despite the decision in Vintage (No 1) where similar arguments were canvassed and rejected, that the proposed second further amended statement of claim disclosed a new (and statute barred) cause of action against Mr Johnston. That submission was not adopted by Hunter Valley and I rejected it ( Vintage (No 2) at [32]). An appeal by Mr Johnston from the decision in Vintage (No 1) , after the publication of reasons in Vintage (No 2) , was dismissed by the Full Court: Johnston v Vintage Developments Pty Limited [2006] FCAFC 171. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1437">29 As set out in Vintage Developments Pty Limited v GHD Pty Limited [2006] FCA 531 at [10] (' Vintage (No 1)' ), the further amended statement of claim was filed with the leave of the Court, which leave, obtained in November 2005 and prior to the expiry of the limitation period, did not extend to joining Mr Johnston. I gave leave for that joinder on 11 May 2006 and no further order was sought from the applicants as to leave to file a second further amended application and statement of claim.</sentence>
