<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 296">On what is before the Court, the Tribunal complied with its obligations set out in s.424AA. Having outlined the particulars as to the relevance of the information, the Tribunal invited the applicant to comment or respond ([53] --- [67]). The applicant was notified that he was entitled to seek additional time in which to do so ([52], [68]). As a result, because of s.424A(2A) , the Tribunal was not obliged to give this information to the applicant in writing pursuant to s.424A(1) (see SZMCD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 (" SZMCD ") at [90], SZMMP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 at [51] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 282">On what is before the Court, I am satisfied that the Tribunal complied with its obligations set out in s.424AA. Having outlined the particulars as to the relevance of the information, the Tribunal invited the applicant to comment on or respond to them ([61]). The applicant was notified that he was entitled to seek additional time in which to do so ([62]). As a result, even if any obligation under s.424A(1) could be said to have been invoked, because of s.424A(2A) the Tribunal was not obliged to give this information to the applicant in writing pursuant to s.424A(1). (See SZMCD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 at [90] , SZMMP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 at [51] . ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 203">On what is before the Court in this regard, the Tribunal complied with the requirements set out in s.424AA. In those circumstances, because of s.424A(2A) , the Tribunal was not obliged to give this information to the applicant pursuant to s.424A(1). (See SZMCD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 at [90] , SZMMP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 at [51] . ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1290">The relationship between these two sections has been found by a Full Federal Court in SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 to be facultative and complimentary. Relevantly, s.424AA is, in that sense, no more than a method by which the Tribunal may comply with its obligation under s.424A(1). (See SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 at [90] , SZMMP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 at [51] . ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 1198">I should also just note that, in any event, as Ms Warner Knight submits, s.424AA is relevantly no more than a method by which the Tribunal may comply with its obligation under s.424A(1). (See SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 , SZMMP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 233. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 558">As the Tribunal has a complete discretion to invoke the provisions of s 424AA , it was not necessary for the Tribunal to comply with section 424AA. Finally, non compliance with the provision (even if embarked upon) would likely not amount to jurisdictional error in any event: see SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 per Tracey and Foster JJ at [103] --- [104], Moore J agreeing at [1]. [15] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 578">It may finally be noted that, even if there has been a failure to comply with s 424AA(b)(iv) , the consequence is that s 424A(2A) is not engaged and the Tribunal is not thereby excused from compliance with s 424A(1): SZMMP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 at [55] per Lander J. Sections 424A and 424AA are complementary: SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 at [2] per Moore J; SZMIS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 167 at [10] per Marshall J. But no failure to comply with s 424A(1) is asserted by the now Appellant and none is otherwise discernible. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 471">There are a large number of authorities to support the above. (See SZMMP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 per Lander J at [63], and also SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 per Cowdroy J, SZMAE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 per Edmonds J, SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1866 per Middleton J, SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 per Gilmour J and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 per Jaggot J, cited in SZMMP at [63] and in SZMCD at [98]. See also SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [99] . ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCAFC 46">95 That further authority is SZMMP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 , a decision of Lander J. In SZMMP , his Honour considered the interpretation of s 424AA when assessing the merits of a prospective appeal for the purpose of deciding whether or not he would grant an extension of the time within which the applicant in that case might file a notice of appeal. In that case, after considering the legislative context and reviewing the relevant provisions, his Honour said ( SZMMP [2009] FCA 233 at [55] ---[59]): 
 
 
 55 A failure to comply with s 424AA merely means that s 424A(2A) is not engaged and the Tribunal is not excused from compliance with s 424A. That then means the Tribunal must comply with s 424A. If the Tribunal is obliged to comply with s 424A it does not have to give the information in s 424A(3). 133 In light of the withdrawal of the submissions made on behalf of the first respondent on this point we are now not required to consider the submission originally made on behalf of the first respondent directed to this issue. We would wish to observe, however, that we are of the view that the judges who decided the cases which ended with SZMMP [2009] FCA 233 correctly interpreted s 424AA. We would not, therefore, have been persuaded that each of them was wrong. Indeed, we have explained why we think those cases were correctly decided. Therefore, the point at issue would not have arisen in any event.  95 That further authority is SZMMP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 , a decision of Lander J.
