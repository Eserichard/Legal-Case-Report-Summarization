<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 247">Order 35A rule 3(2)(c) applies where, as here, the proceeding was commenced by application and statement of claim. It is now well established that an application for the relief to which the rule refers does not need to be supported by evidence; Luna Park Sydney Pty Limited v Bose [2006] FCA 94 ; Humphries v Halifax Vogel Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 569 ; (2008) 76 IPR 144. It is sufficient that there is a claim for the relief sought on the facts stated in the statement of claim, and that the Court has jurisdiction and power to grant that relief. In this case the relief relates to claims of infringement of trademarks, of which the applicants are the registered owners, in particular, the WINDOWS trade mark is well known as relating to computer systems software and which is sold with user manuals. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1143">It was previously the case that there was no presumption, upon default of a respondent not filing an appearance and defence, as to the correctness of an applicant's claims. In Luna Park Sydney Pty Limited v Bose [2006] FCA 94 , Jacobson J at [16]-[18] noted that position and that O 35A now provides the foundation for a finding that, in the absence of a defence and where there is a pleading by way of statement of claim, then the facts in the statement of claim are admitted. That decision was followed by Logan J in Humphries v Halifax Vogel Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 569 ( Humphries ) at [7]-[9]. His Honour referred to some recent authorities which have adopted a similar approach. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1084">This is not a case where the legal issues inherent in claims of detinue, specific restitution, or pursuant to the Income Tax Assessment Act or the Corporations Act , were raised and litigated (contrast Nescor Industries Group Pty Ltd v MIBA Pty Ltd (1997) 150 ALR 633). It does not automatically follow that a claim for an order requiring the respondents to deliver chattels to the applicant introduced those causes of action to be met by the respondents --- indeed the pleadings equally support a claim for a mandatory injunction, or an order pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ( Humphries v Halifax Vogel Group Proprietary Limited [2008] FCA 569 ; (2008) 76 IPR 144). Accordingly, even had I made factual findings in favour of HFAT on the issue of whether Mr Rhys Thomas had taken the HFAT booking records, I consider that a decision on the previously undisclosed bases submitted by HFAT after judgment had been reserved would be procedurally unfair. </sentence>
