<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 523">The inquiry which was directed by the Full Court was conducted by Allsop J who, in a judgment delivered on 8 June 2007 ( Maxwell-Smith v Donnelly (in the matter of Inge and Eugene Maxwell-Smith) [2007] FCA 894) , concluded that there was no basis for criticism of the conduct of Mr Donnelly. Allsop J dealt in detail with the background to the complaint made about Mrs Maxwell-Smith's desire to travel outside Australia with her grandson. It is evident that the trustee's administration was not without difficulty, occasioned in part by the sense of grievance which Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith felt.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 549">Any restriction imposed on Mr Stillman must be seen as being aimed at ensuring the proper administration of the bankrupt estate, [17] and overseas travel may be subordinated to that which is necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the bankrupt estate and of bankruptcy law. [18] However, the mere status of bankruptcy is not to be used to penalise Mr Stillman. [19] If Mr Stillman is in default of any of his obligations, denial of permission to travel, or conditional permission to travel, may be appropriate as a means to encourage compliance with his obligations. [20] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 474">In accordance with the Full Court's order, an inquiry was conducted by Allsop J pursuant to s 179 of the Act: see Maxwell-Smith v Donnelly (in the matter of Inge and Eugene Maxwell-Smith) [2007] FCA 894 ; [2007] FCA 1005 and [2007] FCA 1097. His Honour found that there was "no basis for criticism of the ... trustee or his manager ...". He also ordered that "the costs, remuneration and expenses of the respondent trustee ... as taxed ... form part of the respondent trustee's costs, charges and expenses of the administration ...". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 412">5 In my view, the costs incurred by Mr Pascoe in defending the proceedings were costs incurred in the administration of the estate. If there were funds in the estate, Mr Pascoe would be entitled to have his costs directly from the estate without having to enforce a costs order separately against Mr Boensch. Should any different course be taken because there are no present funds in the estate? In my view there is no reason in principle why costs of the proceedings should not, in the ordinary way, form part of Mr Pascoe's costs of the administration of Mr Boensch's estate (see also Maxwell-Smith v Donnelly (2007) FCA 894 at [52] ; Maxwell-Smith v Donnelly (2007) FCAFC 180 at [13] ). I am not prepared to fashion a costs order in some different way in the present case with a view, if this is what would be involved, to enhancing Mr Pascoe's position or departing from what I understand to be the normal approach to these issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCAFC 180">2 Proceedings were commenced in 2004 against the respondent ('the Trustee'), who had been the trustee in relation to the bankruptcy of Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith. The bankruptcy had been annulled. Pursuant to a decision of the Full Court ( Maxwell-Smith v Donnelly [2006] FCAFC 150) , the primary judge conducted an inquiry under s 179 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) into the refusal of the Trustee to give permission to Mrs Maxwell-Smith to travel outside of Australia on or about 20 May 2004 ( Maxwell-Smith v Donnelly (in the matter of Inge and Eugene Maxwell-Smith) [2007] FCA 894). In that inquiry Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith were represented by counsel, who appeared pro bono pursuant to a referral by the Full Court under O 80 r 4(1) of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
