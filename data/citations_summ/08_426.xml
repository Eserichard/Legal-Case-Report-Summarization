<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] AATA 580">An authority such as CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [474] reflects that approach. It refers to resort to " legitimate means " quite apart from s 15AB and those that the High Court specifically had in mind at the time were reports of law reform bodies. In Mitchell v Bailey , [475] Tracey J understood the " legitimate means " to extend to parliamentary debates. That would be a position consistent with the law as stated by Kirby J in Barwick v Law Society of New South Wales when looking to the development of the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW):
 
" The deletion of this provision following earlier consideration of the exposure draft bill, and the substitution of the general power in the Commissioner to accept a complaint made after three years following the conduct complained of, indicate clearly enough a changed purpose to which effect should be given. By reference to a number of old authorities Sheller JA expressed doubt that a court should, or would, pay regard to such a consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 692">32 There was a threshold issue of whether any inspection was permissible, consistently with the provisions of s 360(1)(iii) of the Act. I had earlier given consideration to the construction of s 360(1)(iii) when dealing with an application by the petitioner that the Commission should be ordered to provide each of the other parties with copies of the reserved ballot-papers. I refused that application because s 360(1)(iii) manifested a clear intention that the Court must not grant leave to parties to inspect and copy ballot-papers: see Mitchell v Bailey [2008] FCA 426. In the course of my reasons I said (at [35]) that:
 "It ought not to be assumed, in any event, that a refusal of the petitioner's application will mean that he and/or his legal advisers will not have access to some or all of the reserved ballot-papers in the course of the hearing. It may well be that this can be achieved, consistently with the Act, by other means.</sentence>
