<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 519">The respondents object to exhibit P document 115, A Report of the Select Committee on Reserves. The applicant submits that document is admissible subject to Parliamentary privilege and so is not admissible to prove the facts contained in it. However it is submitted that document 115 is admissible to the extent that it provides content to matters deposed to by Margaret Jeffery by way of reference to the report in the affidavit affirmed 25 November 2005 to which it was annexed. In Bella Bropho v Western Australia [2006] FCA 272 , I ruled the document inadmissible on the grounds of hearsay and opinion. Grounds based on relevance and parliamentary privilege were not upheld but that cannot overcome the inadmissibility arising from hearsay and opinion.  The respondents object to exhibit P document 21, an extract from a Report of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. The applicant again maintains the document is admissible to the extent that it provides content to matters deposed to by Margaret Jeffery by way of reference to the report in the affidavit affirmed 25 November 2005 to which it was annexed. Alternatively, that document 21 is to be taken into account as submission by the applicant. Document 21 fails for the same reason as document 115, having also been previously ruled upon in Bropho [2006] FCA 272. </sentence>
