<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 344">In Futuretronics.com.au Pty Ltd v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 746 ; (2008) 76 IPR 763 , Besanko J said at [17]: 
 
 
 ... First, there is no need ... to consider if an award of additional damages can be made under s 115(4) if no damages are awarded under s 115(2) because I have awarded ... damages under s 115(2): ( Polygram Pty Ltd, Island Records Ltd &amp; A &amp; M Records Inc v Golden Editions Pty Ltd, Hoghton Hughes (No 2) (1997) 76 FCR 565 at 576; 148 ALR 4 at 13---14; 38 IPR 451 at 459---61 ( Polygram ) per Lockhart J; MJA Scientifics [ International Pty Ltd v SC Johnson &amp; Son Pty Ltd (1998) 43 IPR 275] at 283---284 per Sundberg J. Second, it is not necessary that there be a proportionate relationship between the additional damages awarded under subs (4) and the damages awarded under subs (2): Flags 2000 Pty Ltd v Smith (2003) 59 IPR 191 ; [2003] FCA 1067 at [31] - [34] per Goldberg J. An award of additional damages under subs (4) is not dependent upon the adequacy or inadequacy of an award of damages under subs (2). Third, the matters in subs (4)(b)(i)---(iv) inclusive are not preconditions to an award of additional damages. In other words, and using the flagrancy of the infringement as an example, the court must have regard to the flagrancy of the infringement in determining whether to award additional damages, but is not the case that additional damages can be awarded only if the breach involves a particular degree of flagrancy. Fourth, ... there is a distinction between conduct of a defendant after an infringement (or after being informed that he has allegedly infringed the plaintiff's copyright) and relevant to the substantive allegations against him on the one hand, and the defendant's conduct of his defence to an action for an infringement of copyright in relation to procedural matters on the other. The former matter is within the terms of s 115(4)(b)(ib) of the [Copyright] Act, whereas ... the latter matter is a matter to be taken into account in determining the appropriate order as to costs. ... Fifth, an award under s 115(4) of the [Copyright] Act can encompass damages which at common law would be aggravated damages and exemplary damages: Bailey at FCR 113--- 114; ALR 238 ; IPR 156. 
 
 

  Nonetheless, each case turns on its own facts and one must approach with caution any suggestion that very substantial awards of damages are appropriate in every case.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 799">In Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 ; (2008) 79 IPR 236 and Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74 ; (2008) 166 FCR 358 , Kenny and Jessup JJ awarded damages for damage to reputation because in each case, they found that there was some probable diminution in the commercial value of the design in respect to future use and would have an adverse effect upon the applicant's reputation in exclusivity of design. Kenny J awarded damages of $35,000 where the respondent had sold 730 units and Jessup J awarded damages in the sum of $7,500 in respect to the sale of approximately 157 units. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 709">In Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd and Anor (2008) 166 FCR 358 ; [2008] FCA 74 , Jessup J awarded $7,500 for damage to reputation under the Designs Act 2003 . His Honour said at [30] and [31]: [30] I think there is sense in the applicant's position in this regard, particularly with respect to so much of the respondents' infringement as concerns offering to sell, and selling, their own dress. I accept the applicant's evidence that it put considerable value by the perceived originality of its garments. However, her Honour addressed the paucity of evidence of the impact of the infringing products on the reputation of the plaintiff, and the difficulties with assessing the damage to reputation in the following terms: [33] In the present case, I find that it was reasonably foreseeable that infringement of the applicant's copyright would cause a loss of reputation to the applicant in terms of brand-name recognition. However, the applicant adduced no evidence of the damage it allegedly suffered to its reputation by reason of the infringement of its copyright. In previous cases where damage to reputation has been quantified, evidence was usually led to establish (a) the importance of singularity, distinctiveness, quality or some other commercially valuable aspect of reputation to the victim and (b) how, and to what extent, the infringing product or conduct damaged that aspect of the victim's reputation: see Paramount Pictures Corporation v Hasluck (2006) 70 IPR 293 ; [2006] FCA 1431 at [55] ; New Cover[ [6] ] at [44]---[46] and Innovative[ [7] ] at [29]---[31]. [34] What then is the commercially valuable aspect of the applicant's reputation, and how, and to what extent, was this commercially valuable aspect damaged by the conduct of the respondent? At its highest, it was submitted by the applicant that the "iconic" and "exclusive" nature of the Elwood brand was "cheapened" by the production of the infringing products of the respondent. Sixthly, the applicants submitted that the respondents, despite being put on notice that they were infringing the applicants' copyright, continued to sell counterfeit copies of the applicants' products: Fahd affidavit at [8]. I accept that evidence and accept that it warrants an award of additional damages: see Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Style Investments Pty Ltd (2008) 166 FCR 358 ; [2008] FCA 74. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 433">O'Dwyer FM in Urban Culture pointed out that smaller amounts of damages have been awarded in the range of $7500 to $10,000 in Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty ltd and Anor [2008] FCA 74 ; Crimson SRL &amp; Anor v Claudia Shoes Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (No.7) (2008) ASAL.  The applicants sought an award of additional damages in the sum of $100,000. In their outline of submissions the applicants have referred to cases where additional damages have been awarded in the range of $3million to $50,000. I find an award of $50,000 will serve as a specific deterrent on the respondent as well as a general deterrent to those in their industry who may be tempted. (See Amalgamated Mining Service Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd [1992] FCA 542 ; (1992) 24 IPR 461 , Bailey v Namol [1994] FCA 1401 ; (1994) 30 IPR 147 , Milpurrurru and Others v Indofurn Pty Ltd and Others (1994) 30 IPR 209 , Microsoft v Goodview (2000) 49 IPR 578 , Microsoft Corporation and Others v PC Club Australia Pty Ltd and Others [2005] FCA 1522 ; (2005) 67 IPR 262 , Fraserside Holdings &amp; Anor v Venus Adult Shops &amp; Ors [2005] FMCA 997 , Foxtel Management Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Mod Shop Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2007] FCA 463 ; (2007) 72 IPR 1 , Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd (in Liquidation) &amp; Ors [2007] FCAFC 40 ; (2007) 71 IPR 437 , Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 , Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd and Anor [2008] FCA 74 , Elwood Clothing Pty Ltd v Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 633) and G-Star Raw Denim KFT &amp; Anor v Urban Culture Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 1317).  As the applicants pointed out in their outline of submissions, there is no exact formula to determine the amount of damages for loss of reputation. In previous cases the number of counterfeit garments offered for sale by respondents have ranged from 20 to 28,139 garments: See Crimson SRL &amp; Anor v Claudia Shoes Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (No.7) (2008) ASAL; Elwood Clothing Pty Ltd v Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 633. Awards of damages for loss of reputation have ranged from $7,500 to $35,000: see Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd and Anor [2008] FCA 74 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 ; G-Star Raw Denim KFT &amp; Anor v Urban Culture Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 1317. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCAFC 55">357 In that part of the primary Judge's reasons which dealt with the operation of s 75(2) of the Designs Act , her Honour made it clear that her judgment against Ren and Olsen did not involve a finding that either of them "made" the articles to which the infringing designs had been applied. That was because the articles had been made outside Australia, and, in her Honour's view, s 71(1) of the Designs Act did not have extraterritorial operation. Her Honour held, however, that Ren and Olsen were secondary infringers within the meaning of s 75(2)(b) , in that they had imported the articles, and offered them for sale in Australia. She added that she "would consider" Messrs Keller and Armstrong to be secondary infringers as well, on a similar basis to that upon which Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74 ; (2008) 166 FCR 358 was decided, namely (in the words of her Honour), that "importing or selling, as the case may be, should be understood to also include directing, causing or procuring an infringing item to be imported or sold". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 1317">In respect of the other component in s.115(2) of the Act for compensation for loss of reputation, I looked at similar cases where similar items and numbers were involved. In Review Australia Pty Ltd v The New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 the court ordered $35,000 based upon 700 infringing garments being sold. In this case, I am satisfied that the applicants' products have a well-defined and strong position in the marketplace and that they are at risk of, and on balance, have suffered a loss of reputation by the sale of these counterfeit garments and that the figure of $35,000 is an appropriate award. In determining that amount, I am conscious of lesser amounts being awarded for loss of reputation in the range of $7500 to $10,000, but this case, in my view, is distinguished from them by the following factors, which cumulatively heighten the real prospect of damage to reputation to a degree not so prevalent in the other cases: the second applicant loses sales of the G-Star products as consumers refuse to pay the higher prices for the G-Star products when similar looking counterfeit "G-Star" products are available in the marketplace for cheaper prices; the second applicant loses customers as they no longer purchase the G-Star products as they are no longer considered "exclusive" as cheaper copy product is available in the marketplace; the second applicant's retail customers no longer wish to purchase the G-Star products as counterfeit "G-Star" products are being sold in retail stores within close proximity to their store and at cheaper prices; and the applicants ensure strict quality control for any product sold under or by reference to the "G-Star" marks and the Urban Culture products are not subject to these controls.

 Additional Damages
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 633">The observations made by Besanko J in Futuretronics.com.au Pty Ltd v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 746 ; (2008) 76 IPR 763 at [17] should be repeated: 
First, there is no need ... to consider if an award of additional damages can be made under s 115(4) if no damages are awarded under s 115(2) because I have awarded ... damages under s 115(2) ( Polygram Pty Ltd v Golden Editions Pty Ltd (No 2) 38 IPR 451 at 459-461 per Lockhart J; MJA Scientifics [International Pty Ltd v S C Johnson and Son Pty Ltd (1998) 43 IPR 275] at 283-284 per Sundberg J). Second, it is not necessary that there be a proportionate relationship between the additional damages awarded under subs (4) and the damages awarded under subs (2): Flags 2000 Pty Ltd v Smith [2003] FCA 1067 ; (2003) 59 IPR 191 at 198 per Goldberg J. An award of additional damages under subs (4) is not dependent upon the adequacy or inadequacy of an award of damages under subs (2). Third, the matters in subs (4)(b)(i)-(iv) inclusive are not preconditions to an award of additional damages. In other words, and using the flagrancy of the infringement as an example, the court must have regard to the flagrancy of the infringement in determining whether to award additional damages, but is not the case that additional damages can be awarded only if the breach involves a particular degree of flagrancy. Fourth, ... there is a distinction between conduct of a defendant after an infringement (or after being informed that he has allegedly infringed the plaintiff's copyright) and relevant to the substantive allegations against him on the one hand, and the defendant's conduct of his defence to an action for an infringement of copyright in relation to procedural matters on the other. The former matter is within the terms of s 115(4)(b)(ib) of the [Copyright] Act, whereas ... the latter matter is a matter to be taken into account in determining the appropriate order as to costs. ... Fifth, an award under s 115(4) of the [Copyright] Act can encompass damages which at common law would be aggravated damages and exemplary damages: Bailey 53 FCR at 113-114.  How the Court should treat this lack of evidence may be said not to be settled: compare Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 668 ; (2006) 69 IPR 45 at [35] (acknowledging that relevant evidence could have been but was not provided by the Applicant, but nevertheless applying a 35% discount as a best guess); Norm Engineering [2007] FCA 761 ; 162 FCR 1 , [292]-[296] (applying a 50% discount even where there was evidence that both parties operated in a similar market and that the Respondent was actively attempting to divert sales from the Applicant as market leader); and Innovative [2008] FCA 74 ; 166 FCR 358 at [28] (effectively applying a discount of 100% by refusing to award any lost profits damages on the grounds that to do so would require excessive speculation).  It is evidence of the other integers that is missing. There is no evidence about which entity was the market leader in t-shirts and no basis, whether from expert evidence or otherwise, to determine an appropriate discount factor, particularly given that, unlike the competitors in Norm Engineering [2007] FCA 761 ; 162 FCR 1 , the Applicant and the Respondent were selling to different markets at vastly different prices (approximately $50 versus $15). Indeed, even where the parties were selling to similar markets at similar prices in Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74 ; (2008) 166 FCR 358 (fact found by Jessup J at [23]), the Court found that the Applicant had failed to put forward sufficient evidence for it to draw an inference as to whether some or all of the sales made by the Respondent could be properly characterised as sales lost by the Applicant: see Innovative [2008] FCA 74 ; 166 FCR 358 , [25]-[26].  In the present case, I find that it was reasonably foreseeable that infringement of the Applicant's copyright would cause a loss of reputation to the Applicant in terms of brand-name recognition. However, the Applicant adduced no evidence of the damage it allegedly suffered to its reputation by reason of the infringement of its copyright. In previous cases where damage to reputation has been quantified, evidence was usually led to establish (a) the importance of singularity, distinctiveness, quality or some other commercially valuable aspect of reputation to the victim and (b) how, and to what extent, the infringing product or conduct damaged that aspect of the victim's reputation: see Paramount Pictures Corporation v Hasluck [2006] FCA 1431 ; (2006) 70 IPR 293 at [55] ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 ; (2008) 79 IPR 236 , [44]-[46] and Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74 ; (2008) 166 FCR 358 , [29]-[31]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 1941">How then does one assess the overall impression of a design in infringement proceedings? As noted earlier, until recently there has been little Australian judicial consideration of the 2003 Designs Act. The principal cases to date include Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74 ; (2008) 166 FCR 358 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 and World of Technologies (Aust) Pty Ltd v Tempo (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 114 ; (2007) 71 IPR 307.  In Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74 ; (2008) 166 FCR 358 ( Innovative ), Jessup J concluded that the word make in s 71(1) also includes those who direct, cause, or procure an infringing item to be made as well as those who make such an item themselves: Innovative at [21]. At first glance, therefore, it would seem that Ren and Olsen would be considered primary infringers. Although they did not make the products themselves, they directed, caused, or procured the Condor lights to be made by issuing purchase orders to their Chinese suppliers based on samples, designs, or other specifications. Elecspess and AAA, having only sold the products, would be secondary infringers. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1760">121 The applicant conceded in this case that it had not lead evidence establishing any actual loss of sales revenue arising from the conduct of the first respondent, but instead claimed damages "at large" as awarded in Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Lt d [2008] FCA 74. Damages sought by the applicant were in the sum of $50,000, representing:
 
&#8226; damages on the basis of notional royalty;
 
&#8226; diminution in the value of the applicant's trade mark; and
 
&#8226; loss of reputation. 125 In claiming that damages "at large" should be awarded the applicant relied in part on the decision of Jessup J in Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74. However:
 
&#8226; I consider that Review Australia [2008] FCA 74 is distinguishable from this case. In Review Australia Jessup J accepted that the market presence of the respondents' product did bring about some minor dilution of the applicant's reputation for originality (at [30]). In my view there is some evidence of minor and short-lived confusion of a small number of consumers, but no evidence that there has been any dilution of the applicant's reputation in any respect by the market presence of the first respondent. 125 In claiming that damages "at large" should be awarded the applicant relied in part on the decision of Jessup J in Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74. However:
 
&#8226; I consider that Review Australia [2008] FCA 74 is distinguishable from this case. In Review Australia Jessup J accepted that the market presence of the respondents' product did bring about some minor dilution of the applicant's reputation for originality (at [30]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1698">19 In the circumstances, I consider both that the allegations in the interlocutory process are made out and that it is appropriate for there to be relief of the kind, although not completely of the kind, sought in the interlocutory process. In addition to the Orders referred to above, the Defendant also sought, in the alternative, a declaration of the Defendant's entitlement to be indemnified by the Respondents. In the circumstances, I do not propose to grant the declaration sought by the Defendant. As Jessup J said in Review Australia Pty Ltd v Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74 at [57] :
 
 
 I can see no point in making a declaration. The applicant has been successful in its action for damages, and the basis of that success appears sufficiently from these reasons. In my view, a declaration would not add further to the appropriate judicial resolution of the dispute which has brought the parties to court.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 1589">44 Review sought damages on an alternative basis, which is made out in the following way. I accept that the infringement resulted in a probable diminution in the value of the design as a chose in action because the infringement resulted in some probable diminution in the commercial value of the design in respect of its future use. Further, the reproduction of the design by New Cover/Maco under the Spicy Sugar label and the wholesale distribution of garments embodying the design to New Cover/Maco's various retail customers is likely to have had some adverse effect on the reputation of the design and its "exclusivity" (or "freshness" as Gowans J said in Prior v Lansdowne at 70; applied by von Doussa J in Milpurrurru v Indofurn Pty Ltd (1994) 30 IPR 209 at 243). See also Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 74 (" Innovative Lifestyle ") at [31] per Jessup J. That is, on the evidence before the Court (to which I am about to refer), the reproduction of the Review Design under the cheaper Spicy Sugar label had the distinct potential to diminish customer interest in the Review Design and, in consequence, consumer demand for garments embodying the Review Design.</sentence>
