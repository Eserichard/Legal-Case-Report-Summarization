<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1128">An application for leave to appeal was dismissed by Flick J on 20 May 2008 (see SZLRL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 716). As did Driver FM, Flick J reviewed the reasons of the Tribunal generally, and could not identify any jurisdictional error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1052">6 Leave to appeal is required because the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court is interlocutory: Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 24(1A). An extension of time is also required. Although there is no rule providing for the time within which an appeal is to be brought in respect to an interlocutory decision of the Federal Magistrates Court, there is an implied time limit of 21 days: SZDGN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1543 at [9] per Lindgren J. See also: Applicant M171/2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 220 at [32] per Moore J; SZLRL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 716 at [6] . The Application as filed in this Court was outside the period of 21 days.</sentence>
