<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] ACTSC 44">23. An application to cross-examine Ms McPartlan under s 38(1)(a) of the Evidence Act about evidence that she had given that was "unfavourable" was then granted. In granting that leave and associated leave under s 38(3) , I relied on the references to "evidence which, at best, is unhelpful to the party calling it" (Adam v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 96 at [27], per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ) and evidence which would "detract from the case of the party calling the witness" or which has "an unhelpful quality about it, as opposed to a neutral quality" (Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 941 ; (2006) 152 FCR 560 at [9] , per Graham J), both quoted in Odgers S, Uniform Evidence Law (Thomson Reuters: 8th ed, 2009) at [1.2.3260]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSC 114">24 The word "unfavourable" does not mean adverse or hostile. It is taken to mean "not favourable" as was held by Smart J in R v Souleyman ("Souleyman's case") [20] and subsequently followed by courts in New South Wales. Although the Federal Court in Hodgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ("Hodgkiss's case"), [21] characterised "unfavourable" as having "to detract from the case of the party calling the witness", it appears from my reading of the authorities that the approach of Souleyman's case [22] is generally preferred and I would apply that definition. Nonetheless, even on the more restricted approach as stipulated in Hodgkiss's case, [23] Flaherty and Connally would meet the requirements of unfavourable.  27 Ms Watson's position is perhaps not as clear. Neither her record of interview nor her most recent statement make any reference to Mr McRae's conduct once they arrive at the Connally property because she stated she fell asleep, other than to say that McRae got out of her car and, at a later point, returned to it. Thus, there is a hiatus in her evidence and the question becomes - is she unfavourable simply because she does not give a complete narrative of the events? In that sense, it may be said that her evidence is neutral, that is, that it does not have an unhelpful quality about it, [25] it is simply limited by how far it goes. However, the Crown does not rely upon her record of interview as a prior inconsistent statement. Indeed, the Crown acknowledges that as between the two accounts, they are consistent.  24 The word "unfavourable" does not mean adverse or hostile. It is taken to mean "not favourable" as was held by Smart J in R v Souleyman ("Souleyman's case") [20] and subsequently followed by courts in New South Wales. Although the Federal Court in Hodgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ("Hodgkiss's case"), [21] characterised "unfavourable" as having "to detract from the case of the party calling the witness", it appears from my reading of the authorities that the approach of Souleyman's case [22] is generally preferred and I would apply that definition. Nonetheless, even on the more restricted approach as stipulated in Hodgkiss's case, [23] Flaherty and Connally would meet the requirements of unfavourable. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 150">[29] Likewise here, the underlying purpose is to be considered when determining the outcome of this application. Evidence unfavourable to a party 
 In Molina this Court analysed numerous cases concerning the meaning of "unfavourable". [30] The Court will not repeat that analysis, but indicates that it is relied on for purposes of these Reasons for Judgment. In Molina the Court observed as follows: 34. It is fair to observe that the boundaries of s.38(1)(a) of the Evidence Act have not yet been completely mapped.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] NSWLEC 324">13 Neutral evidence is not unfavourable, see Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 941. The evidence of Mr Lindsay is neutral, given that there are only subtle wording differences relied on by the Prosecutor.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 87">213 Following a hearing on the voire dire leave was granted to the applicant to so question Mr Suter in accordance with s 38(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (see Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 941 ; (2006) 152 FCR 560). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2006] FCA 960">2 Upon the hearing of the application for leave the applicant called on the voir dire three witnesses namely Mr Suter himself, and two inspectors who had interviewed him on 11 March 2004 and 22 March 2004. The hearing of the s 38 application was protracted and did not conclude until quite late in the day on 24 July 2006, an additional witness in the proceedings having been interposed by leave on 21 July 2006. At the conclusion of the hearing of the s 38 application I delivered ex tempore reasons for judgment ( Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 941) and ordered that leave be granted to the applicant to question Glenn David Suter as though the applicant were cross-examining him in accordance with s 38(1)(c) of the Act.</sentence>
