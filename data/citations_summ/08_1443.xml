<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VSC 288">29 Although it is not the function of the Court on an application to set aside a statutory demand to resolve contested questions of fact or determine where the merits lie in any contest, [24] the Court must have regard to the bank evidence in considering whether a genuine dispute has been shown.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 251">Provision of evidence to substantiate the quantum of the alleged offsetting claim also serves a further purpose. Consideration of that evidence enables the Court to assess, as it must, whether the claim is "genuine", i.e. a claim that is bona fide and truly exists in fact based on grounds that are real, and not spurious, hypothetical, illusory or misconceived: Spencer Constructions Pty Ltd v G &amp; M Aldridge Pty Ltd [1997] FCA 681 ; (1997) 76 FCR 452 at 464. The same test applies in ascertaining the existence of an offsetting claim: West International Pty Ltd v Ultradrilling Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1443 ; (2008) 68 ACSR 108 at [9] . </sentence>
