<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1858">28 In my view this construction of s 163 of the Evidence Act is wrong. Instead I consider the Tribunal was quite correct in concluding, as it did (see [8(b)(i)] above), that s 163 of the Evidence Act provides for a presumption as to when Commonwealth correspondence has been sent , and it does not provide for a presumption as to when that correspondence is received. I consider this comes from both the plain meaning of the words used in the section and the purpose of the section. I should add that in reaching this conclusion, I am forced to reach a different conclusion from that reached by Rares J in SZGMB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 437 , a decision that was relied upon by the Commission before me. In that case, his Honour concluded that: "the effect of s 163 is that the letter is presumed to have been received on the fifth business day after the date it bears. " at [26]. I would also add that Giles J. came to the same conclusion as I have above about s 163 , in Meredith at [21]. </sentence>
