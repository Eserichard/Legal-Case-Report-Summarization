<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 422">Telstra opposed the tender of those paragraphs of the Lee Outline and the attachments, the subject of the grant of leave to use referred to in [41] above, on the ground that they were privileged, but fairly conceded that the weight of authority, in particular authority binding on me, was against its submission. The prevailing authority in this Court is in favour of the filing and service of an outline of evidence being a full waiver of privilege, such that the outline is then protected only by the implied undertaking to the Court not to use the document other than for the purpose of the proceeding without the leave of the Court: Liberty Funding Pty Ltd v Phoenix Capital Limited [2005] FCAFC 3 ; (2005) 218 ALR 283 at [20] --- [23]; Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 at [15] --- [19] per Gordon J; ACCC v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 678 at [122] --- [130] per Finn J; Australian Medi-Care Co Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd (No. 3) [2008] FCA 976 at [15] per Lander J. Once leave is granted to use the document, the party seeking to do so is released from the implied undertaking and may use it accordingly. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 32">96 In addition, Lander J in Australian Medic-Care Co Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Limited (No 3) [2008] FCA 976 followed Gordon and Finn JJ preferring the line of authority to the effect that filing and serving of a witness statement, without more, amounted to a full or limited waiver. </sentence>
