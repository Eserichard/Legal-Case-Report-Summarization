<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 150">In relation to the application of the totality principle, his Honour said at [2010] FCA 562 at [79] - [80]: 
 
 Having so derived the maximum penalty, I then turn to the totality principle. As to that, I prefer an approach evident in the judgment of Goldberg J in a case ACCC v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 21 ; [2006] ATPR 42-101 where his Honour said at [82] and [83]: 
 

 
 
 
 The "totality" principle requires the court, after determining an appropriate ... penalty for specific ... contraventions in accordance with proper principles, to review the total of the ... penalties and consider "whether the aggregate is just and appropriate". ... The totality principle finds its genesis in the criminal law but it has been applied in the context of fixing penalties for contraventions of the [Trade Practices] Act ...</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 790">Telstra submitted that the other cases under s 46 and s 47 of the TPA that are relied upon by the ACCC in its submissions and which attracted significant penalties for corporations, such as Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) v Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 21 ; (2006) ATPR 42-101 ($8.9 million), Universal Music Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) [2003] FCAFC 193 ; (2003) 131 FCR 529 ($1 million), and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) v Fila Sport Oceania Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 376 ; (2004) ATPR 41-983 ($3 million), can also be distinguished from the present case. In those three cases there were significant aggravating features not present in the proceeding presently before the Court: 
(a) all three cases involved senior management (or, in the case of Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 4) (2006) ATPR 42-101 , an 'important person') from the relevant companies;
 
(b) all three cases involved conduct that was deliberate; and
 
(c) all three cases involved conduct by the parties that was directed towards detrimentally affecting competition, and in Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 4) (2006) ATPR 42-101 , seeking to obtain a commercial advantage from the conduct. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 652">Having so derived the maximum penalty, I then turn to the totality principle. As to that, I prefer an approach evident in the judgment of Goldberg J in a case ACCC v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 21 ; [2006] ATPR 42-101 where his Honour said at [82] and [83]:

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 38">I have considered whether the aggregate of the penalties is just and appropriate in the circumstances appertaining to the offending conduct and the offender (see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Limited (No 4) [2006] FCA 21 ; [2006] ATPR 42-101 at 82, 83. In R v Rossi (1988) 142 LSJS 451 , 453, King CJ referred to the totality principle saying that where the total effect of the sentences merited by the individual crimes becomes so crushing, the merciful intervention of the Court may be warranted in order to reduce the total effect. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1976">The Commission submits that the benefit obtained by the contravening conduct is not the only, or indeed the main, determinant of the size of the appropriate penalty in price fixing cases. It notes that, particularly in cases involving conduct over a lengthy period, the extent of that benefit will be impossible to determine. The Commission referred to observations made by Goldberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 21 ; (2006) ATPR 42-101 at [56] - [57] and by me in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Roche Vitamins Australia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 150 ; (2001) ATPR 41-809 at [42] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 1545">26 Also of general relevance to most (if not all) civil penalty provisions is the significance that a pecuniary penalty may have for deterrence upon both the current offender and others: cf Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1990) ATPR 41-076 ; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v D M Faulkner Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1666 at [53] per Bennett J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Gullyside Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1727 at [34] per Kiefel J; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v High Adventure Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 247 at [11] ; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 21 at [15] per Goldberg J. A " civil penalty ", it has been said, " needs to be sufficiently high to deter contravention by others, but not so high as to be oppressive ": Vivian v Fitzgeralds [2007] FCA 1602 at [29] per Logan J. An apparent limited capacity of a respondent to pay cannot mitigate against the need for an appropriate pecuniary penalty to be applied: Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1399 at [41] , [2006] FCA 1399 ; 155 FCR 377 at 386---7 per Nicholson J.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1040">
 
... The totality principle 66 The totality principle is designed to ensure that the aggregate of the penalties imposed is not such as to be oppressive or crushing (per Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick 166 IR 14 at [30]). 67 In Safeway No 4 [2006] FCA 21 ; [2006] ATPR 42-101 Goldberg J said: 82. The "totality" principle requires the Court, after determining an appropriate ... penalty for specific ... contraventions in accordance with proper principles, to review the total of the ... penalties and consider "whether the aggregate is 'just and appropriate'". ... The point was well made by Spender J in Trade Practices Commission v Annand and Thompson Pty Ltd [[1987] ATPR 48,390 (40-772)] (at 48,394) when he said: 
 
 
 
 
 Each case must, of course, be viewed on its own facts and facts may be infinite in their variety. 
 
 
 
 
 It follows, as his Honour also said, that "[t]he quantum of penalties imposed in other cases can seldom be of very much direct assistance". 
 
 57 The observations of Burchett and Kiefel JJ were cited with approval by Goldberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 21 , [2006] ATPR 42-101 at [72] (Safeway No 4). ... 60 In the recent decision of Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick (2007) [2007] FCA 1080 , 166 IR 14 (Kelly v Fitzpatrick) his Honour identified various considerations which were potentially relevant at [14] as follows: 
 
 &#8226; The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches. 
 &#8226; The circumstances in which that conduct took place.</sentence>
