<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] RRTA 142">Without evidence of selectivity in its enforcement, conscription will generally amount to no more than a non-discriminatory law of general application. Whether this is the proper conclusion, however, will depend on the evidence in the particular case. [60] The UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (the Handbook) provides some guidance on the issue. The Handbook states: 
 
 167. In countries where military service is compulsory, failure to perform this duty is frequently punishable by law.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] RRTA 719">[42] Without evidence of selectivity in its enforcement, conscription will generally amount to no more than a non-discriminatory law of general application. Whether this is the proper conclusion, however, will depend on the evidence in the particular case. [43] If the applicant's claimed forced attendance is found to amount to serious harm and if she was targeted in a discriminatory way to attend because of a Convention ground, then this may be the basis of establishing a well founded fear of persecution. The applicant claims she fears being raped and contracting HIV if she is required to attend the NYS. If there is a real or substantial chance of the applicant being raped and that harm has a nexus to a Convention ground then that could form the basis for finding a well founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 95">As submitted on behalf of the appellant, although the Full Court reversed the decision in Erduran ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VFAI of 2002 [2002] FCAFC 374) it did so on the basis that the transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal (not available in Erduran ) disclosed that the Tribunal had dealt with the case put by the appellant. The Full Court did not disagree with the statements of principle in Erduran and those statements have been applied subsequently ( Applicant VEAZ of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCA 1033 at [21] --- [22], VCAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1005 at [33], VCAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 1 at [34] , and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v WALU [2006] FCA 657). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] RRTA 168">The Minister successfully appealed that decision; it was remitted by judgment of the Federal Court on 30 May 2006 ( MIMIA v WALU [2006] FCA 657 [Federal Court of Australia, Nicholson J, WAD 174 of 2005, 30 May 2006]).</sentence>
