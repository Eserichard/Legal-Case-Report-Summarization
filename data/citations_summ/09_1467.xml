<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 14">
 

3 On 3 November 2009, the plaintiff issued a writ in rem against the ship "Gem of Safaga" as surrogate for the ships "JBU Onyx" and "JBU Opal". The relevant person named in the writ was West Asia Maritime Ltd ("West Asia") and it was alleged to be in control of "JBU Onyx" and "JBU Opal" at the time the cause of action arose and was the owner of "Gem of Safaga" at the time the writ was issued. On 5 November 2009, West Asia filed a conditional appearance, and, on 9 November 2009, it issued a notice of motion seeking orders that the writ in rem be set aside for want of jurisdiction, or, in the alternative, that the proceeding be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. West Asia also sought an order that the arrest of the ship "Gem of Safaga" be set aside, or, in the alternative, that the ship "Gem of Safaga" be released from arrest. On 9 December 2009, the primary judge dismissed the notice of motion: Euroceanica (UK) Ltd v The Ship "Gem of Safaga" [2009] FCA 1467. West Asia appeals against that order of dismissal.</sentence>
