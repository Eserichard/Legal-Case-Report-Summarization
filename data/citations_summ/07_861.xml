<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 128">34 These observations have been applied in recent cases before this Court: see 005 542 512 Pty Ltd (Controller Appointed) v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 861 at [18] and Price Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 154 ; (2007) 243 ALR 728 at [22] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] AATA 1833">It is also apparent that none of the components of the SGC can be remitted. ( Pye and Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 143 ; (2004) 55 ATR 1024 ; Jarra Hills Pty Ltd and Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 37 ATR 1022 ; Iwec Pty Ltd and Commissioner of Taxation [2007] AATA 1051 ; (2007) 94 ALD 247 ; 005 542 512 Pty Ltd (Controller Appointed) v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 861).  Sections 16 , 17 and 19 outline the components of the superannuation guarantee shortfalls. When comparing those provisions with, for example, s 62 of the Act which makes an express provision for remitting part of the SGC payable by the employer, it is apparent that there is no power to remit the SGC. This has been well established in a number of cases ( Jarra Hills Pty Ltd and Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 37 ATR 1022 at 1024; Iwec Pty Ltd and Commissioner of Taxation [2007] AATA 1051 ; (2007) 94 ALD 247 at 251; 005 542 512 Pty Ltd (Controller Appointed) v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 861). </sentence>
