<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 706">I am satisfied that there may be merit in the appeal which the applicant seeks to agitate, particularly as regards the meaning of "income" for the purposes of s 8 of the SS Act: Marsh v Department of Social Security (1986) 12 FCR 100 at 104; Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Richards [2007] FCA 1710 at [41] - [48]; Secretary, Department of Social Security v McLaughlin (1997) 81 FCR 35. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 354">Reference to other sources is useful or may be confirmatory as to the breadth of a statutory term even if it is not precisely the same as that used in another statute. The term "income" under the Act is not precisely the same as used in income tax law. In the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth), it is concerned with "income maintenance" (see Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Richards [2007] FCA 1710 at [33] ). In the present case, it is clear that all amounts are of an income nature and not of a capital nature, except that the sale of the applicant's vehicles, caravan or boat are assets of a capital nature. These are not business assets but are for personal use only. Therefore, for present purposes, all amounts can be treated as being of an income nature. Equally, the Act has long been viewed by the Courts as remedial legislation and "calls for no narrow or pedantic construction" ( Rose v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1990) 21 FCR 241 at 244), cited by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Richards [2008] FCAFC 97. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] AATA 439">In Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations v Richards [2007] FCA 1710 ; (2007) 98 ALD 310 , Collier J discussed the definition and concept of "ordinary income" in the Act. </sentence>
