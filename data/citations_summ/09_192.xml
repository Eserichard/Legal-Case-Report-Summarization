[46] See paras.69-72 below.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 853">While separate breaches, the contraventions arose in relation to a single course of conduct. I am of the view that a discount in the range of 50 per cent for each of the two penalties would be appropriate. I have borne in mind the fact that it is necessary to consider each penalty separately (see Hanssen Pty Ltd v Jones [2009] FCA 192 ; [2009] FCA 192 ; (2009) 179 IR 57 at [74] per Siopsis J), but am of the view that the penalties each related to a breach of an entitlement under a provision in a NAPSA and involved relatively similar amounts so that there is no reason to draw any particular distinction between them in relation to quantum. Having regard to the need for general and specific deterrence and the lack of contrition, I am of the view that it is not appropriate that the penalty be set at a minimum, but that a penalty in the order of 50 per cent of the maximum applicable for each breach is appropriate. The maximum penalty for each breach is the sum of $6,600.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 756">It is necessary, however, as the Federal Court has pointed out in the Hanssen Appeal , to consider each penalty separately. [18] However, both of the penalties here are similar in that they are a breach of an entitlement provision of a NAPSA and in both cases they are for relatively similar amounts, one being slightly over $1,000, the other slightly over $1,350. In those circumstances there is no reason, in the Court's view, to particularly distinguish between them, in terms of the quantum of penalty. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 664">[10] [2008] FMCA 291 at para.6 per Lucev FM (" Hanssen "). Hanssen was successfully appealed, and the penalty reduced, because this Court placed too much emphasis on the vulnerability of the employees to exploitation, rather than making findings of exploitation and articulating the actual detriment, which in the circumstances, was no greater than, and no different to that of, non-vulnerable employees. However the ordinary principles used to assess penalty were not criticised: Hanssen Pty Ltd v Jones [2009] FCA 192 ; (2009) 179 IR 57 at 68 and 74 per Siopis J; [2009] FCA 192 at paras.61 and 99 per Siopis J (" Hanssen Appeal ") and in any event are also uncontroversial: see, for example, Olsen v Sterling Crown Pty Ltd (2008) 177 IR 337 ; [2008] FMCA 1392 (" Sterling Crown "); CFMEU v Austral Bricks (Qld) Pty Ltd (2009) 178 IR 470; [2009] FMCA 143.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FMCA 538">[3] " Carr ". [4] Hanssen at para.6 per Lucev FM. Hanssen was appealed, and the relevant penalty reduced on appeal from $173,250 to $85,000: Hanssen Pty Ltd v Jones (2009) 179 IR 57 ; [2009] FCA 192 (" Hanssen Appeal "), because this Court placed too much emphasis on the mere fact that there had been exploitation of vulnerable employees rather than articulating the actual detriment, which in the circumstances, was no greater than, and no different to that of, a non-vulnerable employee: Hanssen Appeal IR at 68 and 74 per Siopis J; FCA at paras.61 and 99 per Siopis J. The ordinary principles used to assess penalty were not however criticised in Hanssen Appeal.
