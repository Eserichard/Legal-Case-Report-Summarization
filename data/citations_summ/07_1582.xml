<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] VSC 423">10 Clause 4.5 of the Mitchell Scheme provides that each Scheme Participant warrants to Aegis that their Scheme Shares are free from encumbrances.

 (i) A deemed warranty provision 
 
 12 The proposed scheme provides for a deemed warranty from the Healthscope shareholders that their shares are free from encumbrances. The view consistently taken by Courts in recent times is that a deemed warranty clause is unobjectionable as the purpose and effect of a deemed warranty clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. [8] In the circumstances, and consistently with the preponderance of authority, I do not regard the warranty clause as posing any issue in relation to the Court exercising its power to convene the meeting. 13 I am also satisfied that there is adequate disclosure of this provision in the explanatory booklet.

(ii) Exclusivity Provisions 
14 Healthscope has agreed to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit or accept alternative proposals for a certain period.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] VSC 154">[12] 
 
 Deemed warranty 
 
(10) Clause 8.6 of the Share Scheme states that:
 
Each Scheme Participant is deemed to have warranted to [Incitec US Holdings] that all of their Scheme Shares (including any rights and entitlements attaching to those shares) will, at the date of the transfer of them to [Incitec US Holdings], be fully paid and free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise, and restrictions on transfer of any kind, and that they have full power and capacity to sell and to transfer their Scheme Shares together with any rights and entitlements attaching to such shares. (11) This type of clause was strongly criticised by Fryberg J in Mincom No 1 [13] as being:
 
onerous, unreasonable and calculated to catapult unsuspecting shareholders who have not read the small print of the arrangement in the schedule to the explanatory statement into a statement of breach of warranty. (12) However, the subsequent line of authorities, including APN, Adelaide Bank, [14] Re Orion Telecommunications Ltd [15] , Coles Group No 1 [16] and Re Hostworks Group Ltd, [17] consider such clauses to be acceptable as long as the warranty is sufficiently disclosed in the explanatory statement to shareholders. (13) Having regard to the disclosure made in section 1.11 of the draft Scheme Booklet, we submit that this deemed warranty clause is acceptable. Performance Risk 
 
(14) Some recent court cases have raised the issue of 'performance risk' --- ie, the danger that the bidding company may be, or may become, unwilling or unable to meet its obligations to pay the cash consideration component to the transferor shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] NSWSC 323">I share the understanding of his Honour that the purpose and effect of such a clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. The amount of the damages payable for breach of the warranty would be equal to the amount required to discharge the encumbrance. I note that the approach of Lindgren J has been preferred in subsequent cases, including by Robson J in Re Coles Group Ltd [2007] VSC 389 at [45] ; by Lander J in Re Adelaide Bank Ltd [2007] FCA 1582 at [33] ; and by Gyles J in Orion Telecommunications Ltd [2007] FCA 1389 at [9] . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 64">41 Under cl 7.3(a) of the Implementation Agreement, each scheme participant is deemed to have warranted that all of its shares in Hostworks which are transferred under the scheme will be free from all mortgages and encumbrances. Fryberg J in Re Mincom Ltd (No 3) (2007) 25 ACLC 207 , regarded an almost identical deemed warranty clause as onerous and unreasonable and "calculated to catapult unsuspecting shareholders who have not read the small print of the arrangement in the schedule to the explanatory statement into a state of breach of warranty": at [21]. In Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400 , Lindgren J disagreed with the approach of Fryberg J: see at [59]-[62]. I respectfully agree with and adopt the views of Lindgren J. I share the understanding of his Honour that the purpose and effect of such a clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. The amount of the damages payable for breach of the warranty would be equal to the amount required to discharge the encumbrance. I note that the approach of Lindgren J has been preferred in subsequent cases, including by Robson J in Re Coles Group Limited [2007] VSC 389 at [45] ; by Lander J in Re Adelaide Bank Limited [2007] FCA 1582 at [33] ; and by Gyles J in Orion Telecommunications Ltd [2007] FCA 1389 at [9] . 

19 Obviously, one focus of the Court in fulfilling that task is to ensure that there is sufficient disclosure to those who may be affected by the proposed scheme of its details and effect: see Re Central Pacific Minerals NL [2002] FCA 239. In that case, Emmett J at [9] said that, amongst the factors to which the Court should have regard in exercising its discretion whether to convene a meeting, were the acceptability of the documentation of the proposed scheme; the commercial viability and morality of the proposed scheme; the likely acceptability of the proposed scheme; the bona fides of the proposals; whether the proposal could be achieved by another method; and any objections or submissions by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Both Conti J in Re CSR Ltd [2003] FCA 82 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 34 at 36-37 and Lander J in Re Adelaide Bank Limited [2007] FCA 1582 at [38] referred to those criteria with approval, and as conforming with the observations of Santow J in Re NRMA Limited [2000] NSWSC 82 ; 33 ACSR 595 referred to.</sentence>
