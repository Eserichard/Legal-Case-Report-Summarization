These observations have long been applied and followed by subsequent decisions of this Court: eg, SZDJQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 533 at [7] per Bennett J; SZLYI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1809 at [16] per Middleton J; SZMSW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 576 at [19] per Cowdroy J; SZOBH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 776 at [22] per Reeves J. A failure to allege appellable error on the part of the Federal Magistrate " is not a mere matter of form as no original jurisdiction is vested in this Court to review errors perceived to have been committed by the Tribunal ": SZMSZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 877 at [6] . See also: SZJHE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1771 at [7]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1102">In SZJHE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1771 at [11], Flick J reviewed the authorities relevant to an allegation of bad faith in the following terms: ... An allegation of "bad faith" is serious (SCAS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 397) and cases in which " bad faith " will be established " will be rare and extreme and claims of bad faith must be clearly particularised ": Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 394 at [32] , [2007] FCA 394 ; 66 ATR 225. In NAKF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 730 , 130 FCR 210 Gyles J reviewed the authorities and concluded as follows as to that which has to be established to make out " bad faith ": [24] Bad faith cannot be constituted by recklessness in the sense of negligence, no matter how gross the negligence. A tribunal member cannot blunder into bad faith, no matter how stupid and careless the tribunal member is, any more than a person can blunder into deceit ... What is required to make out this case is to find that the tribunal member was recreant to his duty by wilfully and deliberately making the impugned decision without attempting to carry out the statutory duty lying upon him --- tossing a coin without reading the file, allowing in every third applicant, or allowing in applicants from various countries in rotation might be examples. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 877">This deficiency is not a mere matter of form as no original jurisdiction is vested in this Court to review errors perceived to have been committed by the Tribunal: SZJHE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1771 at [7] . And, as has been observed in other decisions of this Court, Grounds of Appeal expressed in like terms to the present " seek to impermissibly review on appeal the decision of the Tribunal by seeking a review on the merits ": SZLYI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1809 at [16] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] NSWIRComm 119">33 Ms Sharp understood that the Association was also submitting that the Force's decision was made for an ulterior purpose and this must also include an allegation of bad faith: See SZJHE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1771. Ms Sharp put that this was a very serious allegation which must be supported by cogent evidence. There was no such evidence in this case and the onus was on the Association to prove an allegation of bad faith. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] QSC 165">[56] 
 
 
[63] In these cases, the test is usually, though not always, formulated with reference to bad faith.</sentence>
