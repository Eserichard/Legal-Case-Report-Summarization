<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 633">How the Court should treat this lack of evidence may be said not to be settled: compare Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 668 ; (2006) 69 IPR 45 at [35] (acknowledging that relevant evidence could have been but was not provided by the Applicant, but nevertheless applying a 35% discount as a best guess); Norm Engineering [2007] FCA 761 ; 162 FCR 1 , [292]-[296] (applying a 50% discount even where there was evidence that both parties operated in a similar market and that the Respondent was actively attempting to divert sales from the Applicant as market leader); and Innovative [2008] FCA 74 ; 166 FCR 358 at [28] (effectively applying a discount of 100% by refusing to award any lost profits damages on the grounds that to do so would require excessive speculation).  Under similar circumstances in Norm Engineering [2007] FCA 761 ; 162 FCR 1 , the Court adopted the "lost profits" method for calculating damages (at [266]-[271]); namely, (1) examine the number of sales made by the Respondent; (2) assume that the Respondent was trying to capture sales from the Applicant, the market leader; (3) assume that the number of sales made by the Respondent is equal to the number of sales lost by the Applicant; (4) discount the number in (3) to reflect the fact that not all sales made by the Respondent can be considered sales lost by the Applicant; and (5) apply any further discount necessary in the circumstances of the case: see also Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 668 ; (2006) 69 IPR 45 (employing a similar approach). In Norm Engineering [2007] FCA 761 ; 162 FCR 1 , the evidence disclosed, inter alia, that the Applicant was the recognised leader in the same market from whom the Respondent was actively seeking to divert sales and expert evidence was adduced calculating the sales lost by the Applicant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 114">154 Ms Gatford submitted that the respondent was unable to "adduce precise evidence of what it has lost because it has been out of the market". She added that, therefore, "a level of guesswork is essential". She relied upon Placer (Granny Smith) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 196 ALR 257 , 266 (per Hayne J): 
 
 It may be that, in at least some cases, it is necessary or desirable to distinguish between a case where a plaintiff cannot adduce precise evidence of what has been lost and a case where, although apparently able to do so, the plaintiff has not adduced such evidence. In the former kind of case it may be that estimation, if not guesswork, may be necessary in assessing the damages to be allowed. References to mere difficulty in estimating damages not relieving a court from the responsibility of estimating them as best it can may find their most apt application in cases of the former rather than the latter kind. 

Ms Gatford submitted that the present case fell within Hayne J's former category. She referred also to the judgments of Wilcox J in Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd [1992] FCA 542 ; (1992) 24 IPR 461 , 478 and of Finkelstein J in Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 668 ; (2006) 69 IPR 45 , 52.</sentence>
