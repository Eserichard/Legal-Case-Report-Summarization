<citphrase id="cp2.19" type=cited from="[1979] FCA 85">trade practices act 1974 (cth), s. 45d (1). the appellant, tillmanns butcheries pty. ltd. ("tillmanns"), was a wholesale and retail butcher carrying on business in canberra and queanbeyan. the first-named respondent, the australasian meat industry employees' union ("the union") was an organization of employees including employees of wholesale and retail butchers and employees in abattoirs. the third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents were the president, secretary and two organizers of the union respectively. in december 1977 two of the respondents entered tillmannss' shop in queanbeyan and asked to see the employees. the request was refused by tillmanns' managing director because it was neither smoko nor lunchtime. the union retaliated by imposing a black ban upon tillmanns' shops. at that time canberra abattoir pty. ltd. ("canberra abattoir"), a company which conducted an abattoir in the australian capital territory, held for tillmanns thirty-two cattle awaiting slaughter and the carcasses of twenty head of cattle and seventeen pigs. as a result of the black ban by the union the live cattle were not slaughtered for some weeks and the carcasses were released to tillmanns only about a week later to avoid deterioration. the appellant instituted an action in the federal court of australia seeking an injunction and damages under ss. 80 and 82 in relation to s. 45d of the trade practices act 1974 ("the act ") alleging that the respondents acted in concert to prevent supplies of meat to tillmanns in breach of s. 45d of the act . the trial judge declined to find that the respondents' conduct had the relevant effect and refused to award damages or to grant an injunction. he stated in his judgment, inter alia, that the plaintiff (appellant) was not entitled to argue that the conduct complained of would be likely to cause substantial loss where the means of proving whether in fact it did cause substantial loss were in its power. the appellant appealed to the full court of the federal court of australia against this judgment claiming that an injunction should have been ordered.  held: per curiam</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp2.20" type=cited from="[1979] FCA 85">the appeal against the first, third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents should be upheld, the cross appeal of those respondents should be dismissed and the appellant should be granted injunctive relief against the above-named respondents because: (1) the appellant was entitled to seek relief on the ground that the relevant conduct of the respondents, if continued, would or would be likely to have the effect of causing substantial loss or damage to the appellant's business.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1031">In SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 the applicant for review had written that he had given full explanations in his previous statement and that certain matters were as he had explained before. However, this left undetermined the extent of the incorporation by reference and, adopting the objective approach referred to above, Rares J held the incorporation extended only to what had been said to the Department about his activities in China and not the whole of the information which had been given to it contained in the file. In SZCKD [2006] FCA 451 the information had been provided to the Tribunal by the applicant's agent in a 31 page facsimile including a number of other documents. In VWBF [2006] FCA 851 ; [2006] FCA 851 ; 154 FCR 302 the information in question was advanced on behalf of the applicant in a letter from his migration agent which stated that the applicant had already sent a statement to the Tribunal and requesting reference to a number of earlier statements and interviews. In SZCBQ [2006] FCA 1538 the applicant had stated in his application to the Tribunal 'Please Refer my Statement Claim of my Refugee Application'. 26 On the issue of republication and adoption, there is a 'blizzard of cases': VWBF [2006] FCA 851 ; 154 FCR 302 at [23] per Heerey J. It is necessary, in the light of the facts in this appeal, to distinguish and put to one side generally those cases raising the issue of whether information has been given for the purpose of the application to the Tribunal where the information has been elicited as the consequence of a question from the Tribunal to an applicant. Of more relevance here on their facts are those cases where the applicant has expressly advanced information that had been initially given to the Department as part of the case on review to the Tribunal. In drawing this distinction in MZXFQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 826 Kenny J cited as illustrative of this latter category M55 [2005] FCA 131 at [25] per Gray J; VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271 at [11] per Merkel J; SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 at [24] and [50] per Rares J; SZCKD v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 451 at [37] per Graham J; VWBF [2006] FCA 851 ; 154 FCR 302 at 312 per Heerey J; and SZCBQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1538 at [12] per Bennett J. As her Honour stated, in these cases s 424A(3)(b) was held to apply. Examination of the manner of giving in each of them may be instructive in relation to the effect of the words used by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 889">I note that this application is made against a background of litigation in the Federal Magistrates Court, this Court and the High Court on earlier occasions: see SZCKD v Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 1896 ; SZCKD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 451 ; SZCKD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] HCATrans 608.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 826">42 The parties referred to numerous decisions in which an issue of this kind arose. In some of these cases, the applicant expressly advanced information that had been initially given to the Department as part of the case on review to the Tribunal: see M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 at [25] per Gray J; VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271 at [11] per Merkel J; SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 (" SZGGT ") at [24] and [50] per Rares J; SZCKD v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 451 at [37] per Graham J; VBWF v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at 312 per Heerey J; and SZCBQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1538 at [12] per Bennett J. In these cases, s 424A(3)(b) was held to apply. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] FMCA 1587">In the decision of SZCKD v the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) FCA 451 the court found references in a Tribunal decision to information contained in the "original application" and the "primary application" related to information contained in the appellant's statutory declaration lodged with the Department. Graham J held that: As a result of the statutory declaration lodged with the Tribunal containing substantially identical information to that contained in the initial statutory declaration lodged with the department, the information in the initial statutory declaration had been given to the Tribunal for the purpose of the review (at 34). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 851">

43 In SZCKD [2006] FCA 451 the Tribunal relied in part on the absence of certain information from the applicant's protection visa application, which was referred to before the Tribunal. Graham J noted that the appellant's migration agent sent to the Tribunal a 31 page fax which included a statutory declaration made by him in the course of his application for a protection visa. His Honour said at [34] that the "inescapable conclusion" was that all of the information contained in the fax, which constituted the application for review as submitted to the Tribunal by the appellant's agent, constituted information that the appellant gave for the purpose of the application within the meaning of s 424A(3)(b). His Honour referred to the statements already mentioned from SZEEU and (at [37]) distinguished the case before him saying:
 
 "This case is quite different from one where in the course of a hearing before a Tribunal member an earlier statement was adopted. In this instance the information to which the Tribunal referred in its reasons was information derived from the documents which the appellant gave to the Tribunal for the purpose of the review application.
