<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 7">Counsel for the cross-respondents submits that there is no general onus on an infringer to establish costs once sales revenue is established. He submits that the authorities as to the onus being on the infringer extend only to issues of allocation of overheads. However, Allsop J in Unilin Beeher BV v Huili Building Materials Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1615 ; (2007) 74 IPR 345 after reviewing the authorities, said at [70]: 

 The infringers should account for the actual profit they have gained from the infringement. In calculating those profits it is appropriate to deduct costs directly attributable to selling and delivering infringing articles from the revenue made from such sales and deliveries. It may be appropriate to deduct a proportion of general overhead costs such as plant equipment and managerial costs. The deduction of such costs depends on this being shown to have been attributable to the sales, the onus for which demonstration is upon the infringers . (Emphasis added)

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCAFC 94">2 The notice of appeal in the present case is not framed in a way which can be easily understood. Notwithstanding directions, no outline of submissions was received by the members of the Court until this morning and, indeed, it is clear that they were not made available until yesterday. Those submissions isolate two grounds of challenge to the decision below ( Unilin Beeher BV v Huili Building Materials Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1615). Before turning to those grounds I should say something about the nature of the case and the procedural background to it.</sentence>
