 UNREASONABLY RAISING ISSUES 
 
 51 In Mok v Minister for Immigration (No 2), [118] Keely J in an immigration case held that the court's power to order a successful applicant to pay the costs in respect of an issue raised by the applicant, on which the applicant has failed, ought to be exercised only where the court, on a consideration of all of the circumstances, has concluded that the raising of that issue by the applicant was so unreasonable that it is fair and just to make the order.</sentence>

1 On 21 March last the Court delivered judgment allowing the appeal, setting aside the judgment and orders below and ordering that the appellant bring in minutes of order covering the orders that should be made in lieu of the orders made below, including costs ( Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corporation Limited [2007] FCAFC 35). The parties have agreed upon some orders but there are issues in relation to both interest and costs which require determination. This judgment should be read with the reasons for judgment on the appeal, together with the judgment below ( Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 1004) as to the substantive issues and the further judgment of the primary judge as to costs and interest ( Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corporation Limited (No 4) [2006] FCA 1779). We shall not repeat the background to, or the substance of, those judgments.
