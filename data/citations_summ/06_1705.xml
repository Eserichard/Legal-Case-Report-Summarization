<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 905">It is simply unacceptable to suggest that an employer should not pay one worker his correct entitlements because that will make it harder for the employer to pay his other workers their correct entitlements. The respondents submitted that, in determining penalty, it is appropriate to take into account the amount that they have paid in legal costs in relation to the proceeding. That was done in Pine v Casello Constructions Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1854 where North J noted that the respondent had spent $8,000 in legal costs and in Furlong v Maxim Electrical Services (Aust) Pty Ltd (No.3) [2006] FCA 1705 where Marshall J noted that the respondent union had expended $80,000 in legal costs. I would certainly be prepared to take into account in assessing penalty the legal costs expended by the respondents in this case. However, there is no evidence in the present case about the amount of the legal costs that the respondents have incurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 818">That brings me to the issue of deterrence. The parties accept that specific and general deterrence are relevant considerations. The CFMEU Respondents submitted that general deterrence could be achieved by means other than the imposition of a penalty such as the making of declarations. Further, the CFMEU Respondents submitted that there was significant deterrence in the Applicant bringing the proceeding itself, citing Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd &amp; Others [2006] FCA 1221 ; (2006) 157 IR 80 at [25] , [31], [34] and [35]; Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd &amp; Others [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 at [138] and [164] per Jessup J; Pine v Expoconti Pty Ltd (2005) 147 IR 426 at [15] --- [16] per Kenny J; Pine v Casello Constructions Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1854 at [9] per North J; Ponzio v D and E Air Conditioning Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 964 at [20] , [29] and [30] per North J; Furlong v Maxim Electrical Services (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1705 at [20] per Marshall J. Those submissions suffer from at least two problems --- they are broad propositions devoid of content and no attempt was made to seek to apply the propositions to the circumstances of this case involving the CFMEU Respondents. In the present case, I do not accept that the issue of deterrence (specific and general) is achieved without the imposition of a penalty. Finally, I accept that the penalty agreed between the parties to be imposed on the CFMEU ($9,000) and Mr Parker ($3,500) is within the permissible range. I say permissible range because I consider that the agreed penalties are at the lower end of that permissible range. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1040">As the respondents submitted, the proceedings themselves might reasonably be thought to have some deterrent effect in respect of the Union and Mr Mates. It has sometimes been appropriate to recognise this factor in discussing deterrence in an industrial context: see, for example, Lisette Pine v Expoconti Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1434 per Kenny J, Pine v Casello Constructions Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1854 at [9] per North J; Ponzio v D and E Air Conditioning Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 964 at [20] , [29]-[30] per North J; and Furlong v Maxim Electrical Services (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1705 at [20] per Marshall J. This consideration may be borne in mind here, although I would not accord it great weight. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 650">The Applicant submitted that the conduct of the CFMEU in this proceeding, (see generally Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (2009) 254 ALR 306 ; [2009] FCA 194 at [23] - [29], [32]-[33]), was such that the Court could not be confident that the CFMEU would be deterred from engaging in similar conduct in the future unless a significant penalty were imposed. It was accepted by the CFMEU that there was a need for specific and general deterrence where contempts of Court have occurred. Counsel for the CFMEU submitted that the legal expenses which it had incurred in relation to the case constituted a significant deterrent, independently of any monetary penalty which might be imposed. They contended that it was proper for the Court to take into consideration the "significant burden imposed by any costs order against [a] respondent": see BHP Steel at [13] and [53]; and the fact that the defending of the proceeding had involved a cost burden on the CFMEU. The CFMEU's legal costs were said to be $78,000. In support of this contention, the CFMEU also relied on Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Construction Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1221 ; Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Consturctions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 ; Pine v Expoconti Pty Ltd (2005) 147 IR 426 ; and Furlong v Maxim Electrical Services (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1705. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 265">(above) will serve a deterrent purpose. 18. There is significant deterrence in the bringing of the proceeding itself: See Ponzio ---v- B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd &amp; Others [2007] FCA 1221 at [25] , [31], [34] and [35]; Ponzio ---v- B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd &amp; Others [2007] FCAFC 65 at [138] and [164] per Jessup J; Pine v Expoconti Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1434 Kenny J at [15] --- [16]; Pine v Casello Constructions Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1854 North J at [9]; Ponzio v D and E Air Conditioning Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 964 North J at [20], [29] and 30]; Furlong v Maxim Electrical Services (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1705 Marshall J at [20]. 19. Further, the achievement of a negotiated outcome at an early stage in this case, is an advantage to the regulator, the Australian Building Construction Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 1526">20. The Court was informed that the CEPU had breached the provisions of the WR Act on three occasions. On the first occasion the Federal Court imposed a penalty of $7,500 on the CEPU for a breach of s.170NC of the WR Act . [29] On the second occasion a penalty of $1750 was imposed on the CEPU by the Federal Court for breaches of s.187AB(1) of the WR Act . [30] In that case, were it not for the parties agreeing penalty, the Federal Court would not have imposed a penalty. [31] On the third occasion the Magistrates Court of Victoria imposed an agreed penalty of $13,000 on the CEPU on an admitted contravention of s.170NC of the WR Act occurring in November 2004. [32] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCAFC 65">9 The Union's breach of s 187AB requires a penalty to be imposed because it involved the Union's representatives pressuring Caelli. In those circumstances, I consider a financial penalty is appropriate. In Furlong v Maxim Electrical Services (Vic) Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1705 , I imposed a penalty of $1750 on a union in respect of a breach of s 187AB. That case concerned one of the sites the subject of this proceeding. The only material difference between that matter and the current matter is that the Union here applied pressure to obtain the payments. Consequently, a penalty in excess of $1750 is appropriate. I would impose a penalty of $2500 on the Union.</sentence>
