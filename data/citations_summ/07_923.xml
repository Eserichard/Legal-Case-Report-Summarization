<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 5">In Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [25] the Federal Court summarised the relevant principles applicable to a summary dismissal application as follows: Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings; (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial; (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial.

 Section 31A of the Act 
 
 Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] . Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: 
 
 
 (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings;
 (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; 
 (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; 
 (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial;
 (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success';

On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial;

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Facts 
 On 29 January 2007 this Court dismissed an application by the respondent to set aside the applicant's bankruptcy notice. [1] An appeal by the respondent against the decision in Genovese was instituted on 16 February 2007. [2] The Federal Court Appeal was dismissed by the Federal Court on 19 June 2007. [3] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FCA 995">2 Mr Kunc, who appears for the Department, then foreshadowed a notice of motion seeking summary judgment pursuant to s 25(2B)(aa) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Act') and, in the alternative, an order that the Department be removed as a party to the proceedings pursuant to s 25(2B)(a) of the Act. A single judge of the Court has power under those sections to make the orders sought (s 25 ; Zegarac v Dellios [2007] FCA 566 at [12] ; Zambini v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1773 at [4] ; Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 923).
