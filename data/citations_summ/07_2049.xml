<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1310">The Applicant had been given ample opportunity to prepare his case based upon the matter properly before the Court, namely the appeal under the AAT Act. The Applicant is aware of the procedures in this Court and the processes undertaken in both the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia --- see for example Pham v Secretary Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 2049.  This was the matter of some discussion during the second day of hearing. I would have decided in any event to refuse the request to issue the summonses (which would have been issued by the District or Deputy Registrar) pursuant to s 40(1C) of the AAT Act. As the applicant was advised in the decision of His Honour, Mr Justice Gray, [2007] FCA 2049 at paragraph 11, the role of the Tribunal is to make its decision on the basis of the material before it. Its role is not to examine the basis for decision made by a previous decision-maker. I could not be satisfied that the Secretary of the respondent department nor the Members who constituted the SSAT could have provided any assistance to these proceedings, indeed it would have been improper for the Members of the SSAT to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 107">In relation to the crucial question on this application for leave to appeal, Mansfield J said, at [23]: 
The decision in Chaney has been applied in a number of cases in which the Court's jurisdiction under s 44 of the AAT Act has been invoked following the refusal to summarily dismiss a review application to the AAT under s 42B: Australian Postal Corporation v Matusko (Unreported, 14 May 1996, Olney J); Board of Examiners under the Mines Safety and Inspection Act 1994 (WA) v Lawrence [2000] FCA 900 ; (2000) 100 FCR 255 ; Duncan v Fayle (2004) 138 FCR 510. It has also been held that a decision under s 33 not to exercise the discretion under s 33 of the AAT Act to dismiss or confine a review application to issues of law is also not a decision to which s 44 applies: see Lawrance v President, Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2005] FCA 541 ; and Pham v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 2049 ; (2007) 99 ALD 694. I am bound to follow those decisions of the Full Court, and with respect I agree with the reasoning of the learned judges in both the Full Court decisions and in the single judge decisions.

I could not be satisfied that the Secretary of the respondent department nor the Members who constituted the SSAT could have provided any assistance to these proceedings, indeed it would have been improper for the Members of the SSAT to give evidence. The allegations made by the applicant are: Bias and judiciary bias --- refer appeal notice at T28, p130; decision of a named Federal Court Judge in an appeal lodged by the applicant citing the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission as the respondent (V307/2002); Notice of Appeal against decision of named Tribunal Member in proceedings V2006/838; Racial discrimination --- alleged against a named Federal Court Judge (refer T28, p130) and Appeal Notice in proceedings [2007] FCA 947 ; Allegations of attempt to pervert the course of justice and conspiracy --- allegations made against a named Centrelink advocate, the solicitor representing Centrelink, the Victorian Registrar of the AAT and me in Statement of Facts and Contentions at paragraphs 4.2 and 4.10, at paragraph 6 of Exhibit D and in letters to the District Registrar of 3 September 2008 and 26 September 2008; Allegation made against the named Centrelink advocate in the Transcript at page 54 and in the Appeal Notice VID 1017/2007; Similar allegations made against SSAT Members at paragraphs 34 --- 37 inclusive of the Statement of Facts and Contentions (Exhibit B); Allegations of fabrication of documents --- these allegations have been directed toward me (refer [2007] FCA 2049 and Statement of Facts and Contentions at paragraph 4.2); against a named advocate of Centrelink in proceedings [2007] FCA 2049 ; allegation that the named Centrelink advocate fabricated a copy of the tax return of the PFT; Allegation of fabrication by a Tribunal Member in a Notice of Appeal (refer additional document 7); by Members of the SSAT at paragraph 26 of Exhibit B and paragraph 15 of Exhibit D; a named Tribunal Member and named officers of Centrelink at paragraphs 5 and 10 of a letter to the District Registrar of 12 December 2006 in application V2006/0838. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 251">44 First, it is possible that the relevant material could have assisted the applicant in his case before the Tribunal. However, as Gray J observed succinctly in Pham v Secretary Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 2049 at [11] , the Tribunal is empowered to make its own decision on whatever material is before it at the time when it makes that decision.</sentence>
