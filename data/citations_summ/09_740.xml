The primary judge stayed the making of the costs order to allow submissions to be made. On 13 July 2009, following the making of submissions, the primary judge confirmed the costs order ( Commissioner of Taxation v Grimaldi (No 8) [2009] FCA 769). </sentence>

 '75 In the exercise of my discretion, I do not consider that further freezing orders should be made in respect of the assets of the third and fifth respondents at this stage. I am mindful of the terms of Mr Stewart's email to Aaron Lyne of 17 October 2008, but, since then another restraining order has been made which has been registered in the High Court of New Zealand, the third and fifth respondents have each appeared unconditionally in these proceedings and they have each given undertakings to this Court in the terms indicated above.
