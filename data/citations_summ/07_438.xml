<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 35">[53] (1987) 168 CLR 165 at 176, also Dawson J at 184. [54] As has been held in He v Lewin [2004] FCAFC 161 ; (2004) 137 FCR 266 at [44] and [70], followed in Zhang v Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc [2005] FCAFC 99 at [23] . See also Bahonko v Moorfields Community [2005] FCAFC 116 at [22] , Wang v University of NSW [2005] FCA 1040 at [8] , Ansari v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd [2007] FCA 1908 at [36] , and Sapula v ResMed Ltd [2007] FCA 438. [55] Zhang (supra) at [31]. [56] The onus of proof on the employer was accepted by the University: see North v Television Corporation Ltd (1976) 11 ALR 599 at 603, and Kennelly v Incitec Ltd [1998] 1470 FCA (Spender J, 29 October 1998), citing Vines v Djordjevitch (1955) 91 CLR 512.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 165">9 His Honour dealt with that application on the basis that he was bound by decisions of the Full Court of this Court in He v Lewin [2004] FCAFC 161 ; (2004) 137 FCR 266 and Zhang v Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc [2005] FCAFC 99 ; (2005) 144 FCR 347 , as well as the decision of Buchanan J in Sapula v ResMed Ltd [2007] FCA 438. Each of those decisions held that a jurisdictional requirement had to be satisfied to ground an action under s 659(2)(e) of the Act. This was that an actual complaint must have been filed in a relevant place before the employee could claim to have been dismissed for a reason which included the filing of that complaint or his or her participation in proceedings against the employer involving an alleged violation of laws or regulations, or recourse to competent administrative authorities, as provided in s 659(2)(e).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 2104">I note that in Sapula v ResMed Limited [2007] FCA 438 the applicant employee had not made any complaint to an organisation outside his employment, his complaint having been made to his employer instead. Buchanan J applied Zhang's case to the operation of s.659 of the Act as it now stands, observing that it seemed to be directly on point and finding that the applicant had no cause of action arising under s.659 of the Act. </sentence>
