("canberra abattoir"), a company which conducted an abattoir in the australian capital territory, held for tillmanns thirty-two cattle awaiting slaughter and the carcasses of twenty head of cattle and seventeen pigs. as a result of the black ban by the union the live cattle were not slaughtered for some weeks and the carcasses were released to tillmanns only about a week later to avoid deterioration. the appellant instituted an action in the federal court of australia seeking an injunction and damages under ss. 80 and 82 in relation to s. 45d of the trade practices act 1974 ("the act ") alleging that the respondents acted in concert to prevent supplies of meat to tillmanns in breach of s. 45d of the act . the trial judge declined to find that the respondents' conduct had the relevant effect and refused to award damages or to grant an injunction. he stated in his judgment, inter alia, that the plaintiff (appellant) was not entitled to argue that the conduct complained of would be likely to cause substantial loss where the means of proving whether in fact it did cause substantial loss were in its power. the appellant appealed to the full court of the federal court of australia against this judgment claiming that an injunction should have been ordered.  held: per curiam</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWLEC 252">Costs are compensatory, not punitive ( Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534) , the power to award them is purely discretionary ( Oshlack v Richmond River Council (" Oshlack ") [1998] HCA 11 ; 193 CLR 72) , and the discretion to award costs on any basis must be exercised judicially ( Port Stephens Council v Sansom [2007] NSWCA 299 ; 156 LGERA 125). There is always also the overriding principle that the costs expected to be met by parties and paid to their opponents must be " proportionate as to what is truly at stake " (see Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1062 ; ATPR (Digest) 42-274 at [18]). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 886">12 Notwithstanding the potential size of the claim here pursued, this situation appears to compare unfavourably with the cost and difficulties caused by discovery in mega litigation such as that in Seven Network Limited v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1062 ; (2007) ATPR (Digest) 42-274 , where Sackville J observed at [15] that there some 85,653 documents had been discovered. Situations such as this have led to the Attorney Generals' 2010 reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission - a Review of Discovery Laws to Improve Access to Justice (see terms of reference at 
 
http://www.alrc.gov.au/inquiries/current/discovery/terms.html) and to the observations and recommendation made by the Victorian Law Reform Commission in its Civil Justice Review Report 14 at Chapter 6, Getting to the Truth Earlier and Easier.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 866">Concern as to the disproportionate legal costs that may be incurred in the resolution of a proceeding, and concern as to the costs also incurred by the community in providing access to the judicial process, has nevertheless been expressed in other proceedings: e.g., Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1062 at [17] to [18] per Sackville J. And concern is not confined to a mere consideration of legal costs incurred by the parties. Protracted litigation --- and, on one view of it, unnecessary litigation --- may have the consequence that other litigants are delayed access to the Courts. Increasing reference is thus being given to the fact that Courts are a " publicly funded resource " and the need to " maintain public confidence in the judicial system ": Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27 at [5] [2009] HCA 27 ; , 258 ALR 14 at 17 per French CJ. </sentence>

[33] In Seven Network v News [2007] FCA 1062 Sackville J noted the usefulness of such restrictions and that while, "perhaps wrongly" he had not imposed rigid time limits, he had kept counsel to their estimates of time (at [24]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] NSWLEC 112">See also Oshlack, Ritchie 8752, and Canterbury City Council v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2004] NSWLEC 536). Even so, as Lloyd J concluded in Canterbury, the rejection of a reasonable offer is but "one among many" factors to be considered. " 
 
 Consideration 
 
84 Costs foisted on parties by their opponents, or by the work practices adopted by the lawyers involved, must be " proportionate to what is truly at stake " (per Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1062 , at [18]), and the community is increasingly looking to the courts to ensure such proportionality. 85 All five separate matters involved in this case have their origins in allegations by Council of wrongdoing on Monaghan's part. The history recounted above highlights important steps along the way: Serious investigations were carried out, and Council's powers deployed; Monaghan was asked for written undertakings, and they were given; Monaghan has strenuously denied all wrongdoing throughout; Statutory orders were issued by Council, and Monaghan challenged them in this court; Class 4 proceedings were commenced because Council alleged Monaghan was in breach of the undertakings given; demands were particularised by Council on 19 March; Monaghan sought to modify relevant consents, and appealed against Council's refusal to approve those modifications; Monaghan largely failed in all the class 1 proceedings, and then settled the class 4 proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 426">A draft agreement, or statements made in correspondence, in some cases may be ultimately characterised as representations. In other cases they may not: eg, Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1062 at [3211]. For the purposes of the present application, it is accepted that the provision of a draft agreement and statements made in letters forwarded from the Respondent to the Applicant may be characterised as the making of a representation. </sentence>

10 In Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 1062 at [2211]-[2212], Sackville J cited the above passage from Tillmanns and said that the reference to Willis did not mean that in assessing the likely effect of conduct at a given time the actual course of events necessarily determined the outcome of the assessment.
