<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 73">90 During the course of the hearing, Ms Luck asked that we stay the proceedings pending her filing an application for removal into the High Court. She told us that the application for removal proposed to challenge the refusals of Graham J and Rares J to disqualify themselves for the reasons that they gave separately on 7 May 2008: Luck v University of Southern Queensland [2009] FCA 479 and [2009] FCA 521. The Full Court refused that stay. It was not appropriate to interrupt the business of the Court in that way.
  95 I have already found that the primary judge did not err in rejecting the allegations of bias which Ms Luck put to him. Subsequently, she sought to raise before us further allegations of bias against his Honour. Another Full Court constituted by Moore, Lindgren and Bennett JJ rejected those same allegations in Luck [2009] FCAFC 54 at [82] - [83]. Ms Luck had relied on the new allegations to establish a claim that his Honour was biased in her attempt to appeal from the decisions the primary judge had made in proceedings VID 488 of 2008. Ms Luck's new allegations were that the primary judge first, had undertaken work when counsel for the Australian Government and, secondly, had been appointed in December 2008 as President of the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal. Moore, Lindgren and Bennett JJ found that a reasonable and informed lay person would not think that these new allegations taken individually or cumulatively would render his Honour to be predisposed to decide in favour of the respondent and against Ms Luck in the primary proceeding. I agree with their Honours' conclusion that these new allegations should also be rejected in these proceedings, because no fair minded and informed lay person might reasonably apprehend having regard to any of those matters, separately or collectively, that the primary judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of Ms Luck's matter: Ebner 205 CLR at 334 [16] and see too: Luck [2009] FCA 479 at [10] per Graham J and [2009] FCA 521 at [5] - [6] at [18]-[20] per myself (see too [81]-[82] above).
