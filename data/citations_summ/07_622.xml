<citphrase id="cp17.15" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">migration act 1958 (cth), ss 6 , 6a. in an application for review of a decision of the minister for immigration and ethnic affairs made in 1984 refusing an application for a permanent entry permit to an applicant who was the spouse of a permanent resident on the basis that the applicant's marriage had been assessed as being one where the parties did not genuinely intend to continue living as a married couple in australia, it being the minister's policy to refuse permanent entry permits in such cases.  held: (1) that relevant considerations which should have been taken into account were not, thus making the minister's decision invalid pursuant to s 5(2)(b) of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (the act), such considerations being:  (i) a report made in 1981 by an interviewing officer in suva expressing an opinion that the marriage relationship was genuine, such report being part of the history of the relationship, all of which was relevant in determining the quality of the marriage as at the date of the minister deciding the application. although the report was not presented to the minister, it was on the departmental file and was accordingly to be regarded as being constructively before him.  peko-wallsend ltd v. minister for aboriginal affairs (1985) 59 alr 51 , referred to.  (ii) statutory declarations of neighbours and acquaintances as to the applicant leading a normal married life and a letter of a social worker as to the applicant's wife living at home with the applicant, such documents being available to the minister, but there being nothing to indicate that he had taken any account of them.  (2) that in determining whether an administrative decision made under statutory authority falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp17.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 839">At the hearing before me the applicant appeared in person. The applicant made submissions directed to the merits of the application. Such an approach in a judicial review application is impermissible. [1] In the course of submissions by the applicant, she provided an explanation for her failure to appear before the Tribunal and provide submissions at that time. The applicant's explanation was that she was suffering from a urinary tract infection which prevented her from attending the hearing. When pressed, it was apparent that she was not under medical treatment at the time and that she made no real efforts to inform the Tribunal of her malady. No medical evidence was presented to the hearing before me to verify the applicant's medical complaint and its potential disabling effects on the day of hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 791">The Minister's counsel relied upon the written submissions made and submitted, in my view correctly, that the sort of merits review matters raised by the applicant are not properly considered in an application of this sort. In reply, the applicant asserted that he did submit arrest warrants and matters about his injury. He said in the ultimate he was not certain whether they were given to the Tribunal. The Minister's counsel confirmed that there did not appear to be any such materials in the court book and I accept that that is correct. It therefore follows, given that the court book represents a comprehensive collection of the materials before the Tribunal, that those materials were not before the Tribunal. It is clear from the judgment of Nicholson J in MZYHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 at [8] that such new evidence cannot now be entertained by this Court. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 752">The Court advised the applicant that it could not take into account additional material that was not placed before the Tribunal.

The material was a plea by the applicant's mother that he be able to stay in Australia. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 691">An application for judicial review is confined to the material put before the Tribunal. The Court refers to the decision in SZJMG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Another [2008] FCA 1145 per McKerracher J at para 27 as follows: "An appeal from the Tribunal to the Federal Magistrates Court or an appeal to this Court is limited to review of jurisdictional error. Fresh evidence is not admissible unless it bears on some jurisdictional error. In MZXYH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 , Nicholson J stated at [8]: "It is not open for an appellant to ask the Court to admit new evidence for the purpose of inviting the Court to disagree with a factual conclusion reached by the Tribunal. Spender J in Servos v Repatriation Commission [1995] FCA 1137 ; (1995) 56 FCR 377 at 380 observed that appeals to the Court from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal '...are only on questions of law. " Marshall J in Ozberk v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 79 FCR 249 at 254 approved Servos [1995] FCA 1137 ; 56 FCR 377 in a migration law framework". 
The Court therefore would have decided that no further material could have been submitted by the applicant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 600">Insofar as the applicant's oral submissions before the Court are concerned, her implicit request to provide further material in relation to the rape of her sister cannot be sustained. Not only did the applicant fail to provide any such material in the period from February to August 2009 (and, indeed, thereafter until the decision was brought down on 20 November 2009) but in any event, such material, not having been before the Tribunal, is not now admissible before the Court. (See MZXHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 per Nicholson J at [8]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 538">The applicant's amended application makes reference to and relies upon an affidavit by her filed 17 July 2009. The affidavit was objected to on the basis that it sought to adduce new evidence not previously before the Tribunal and that it was an attempt to engage in merits review and/or to contradict the factual findings of the Tribunal. It is well settled that such is impermissible: MZXHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [3] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 234">Finally, the applicant in reply said that his father had been threatened once he had relocated. He further said that his family had been threatened at home while he was away and that he believed whatever the Court decided would be good for him. The material asserted was not before the Tribunal and contradicts evidence the applicant gave at the hearing (paragraph 149 --- CB107). It cannot assist the applicant in these circumstances, ( MZXHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 at [8] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FMCA 187">He went on to say that whatever he told the Tribunal was the truth and there was no lie about it and referred to the fact that it took him seven months to get out of the country before coming here and applying for a visa. I accept, as counsel for the Minister submitted, that that issue is comprehensively dealt with in the Tribunal's reasons. Insofar as it might be concluded that the applicant was seeking an adjournment in order to put further material before this Court, the difficulty is that such material is not receivable. The authorities clearly establish that this Court, in conducting a hearing for judicial review where the issues are of the sort in this case, the Court is not entitled to take further evidence that was not before the Tribunal (see MZXHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 at [8] ). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FMCA 197">At the hearing before me, the Applicant also asserted that Mr Lokuge had killed his father. That is the first time in all this long history that such an assertion has been made in terms. The Applicant has advanced a number of versions of his father's death as recorded in the Tribunal's reasons for decision. None of them, however, have moved to a direct assertion that Mr Lokuge actually killed or was directly responsible for the father's death. Given that this assertion was not before the Tribunal, it follows that it cannot be now admitted as new evidence. ( MZXHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 at [8] per Nicholson J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] FMCA 1719">This is an application for judicial review and the Court is limited to the material before the Tribunal (see MZXHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 at [8] per Nicholson J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FMCA 1303">It is not open to the Applicant to seek to introduce new evidence of this sort in these circumstances (see the judgment of Nicholson J in MZXHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 at [8] ). In any event, even if this material was taken on board it would not alter the outcome of the proceeding. In substance it is merely a repeat of the assertions of risk of harm that the Applicant made before the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FCA 1145">27 An appeal from the Tribunal to the Federal Magistrates Court or an appeal to this Court is limited to review of jurisdictional error. Fresh evidence is not admissible unless it bears on some jurisdictional error. In MZXHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 , Nicholson J stated at [8]:
 It is not open for an appellant to ask the Court to admit new evidence for the purpose of inviting the Court to disagree with a factual conclusion reached by the Tribunal. Spender J in Servos v Repatriation Commission [1995] FCA 1137 ; (1995) 56 FCR 377 at 380 determined the question of '... whether, and to what extent, an appellant for review pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) can adduce evidence which was not before the tribunal at the time of its decision'. At 381 Spender J observed that appeals to the Court from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal '... are only on questions of law'. His Honour further held at 382 that the Court had no power to receive the fresh evidence: see also at 385. Marshall J in Ozberk v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 79 FCR 249 at 254 approved Servos [1995] FCA 1137 ; 56 FCR 377 in a migration law framework. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FMCA 1035">The second point to be made is that the evidence that he had not received the Tribunal's letter self-evidently was not before the Tribunal. It is not generally open to the applicant to seek to put new evidence before this Court in order to challenge a finding of fact made by the Tribunal (per Nicholson J in MZXHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 at [8] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2008] FMCA 956">The Applicant did seek to rely upon materials sent under cover of a letter dated 25 June 2008 to the solicitors for the First Respondent from the Applicant's parish priest, Father Gill. Self-evidently, none of this was before the Tribunal. Such material is not admissible in a proceeding of this sort (per Nicholson J in MZXHY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 at [8] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2008] FCA 356">27 While the Certificate might qualify as fresh evidence on the very topic of the Tribunal's inquiry and which was otherwise unavailable to the appellant, unfortunately it does not have relevance to this appeal. It is not open for an appellant to ask the Court to admit new evidence for the purpose of inviting the Court to disagree with a factual conclusion reached by the Tribunal: MZXHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 (30 April 2007).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2007] FMCA 1855">If no useful result could ensue from the granting of the writs sought by the applicant they may not be granted: SZBYR's case at [28] and [29]. Even if, technically, there is an error, relief should still be withheld on discretionary grounds if it would be futile to remit the matter to the Tribunal: MZXHY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 per Nicholson J at [21]. Or, as McHugh J said in Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601 at 635 [140] : Nevertheless, once a breach of natural justice is proved, a Court should refuse relief only when it is confident that the breach could not have affected the outcome of the case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2007] FMCA 1619">5. The authorities to which I have been referred seem to me to establish three relevant propositions: 
 
 
 a) save in cases where misconduct or bias or the like is alleged, as a general proposition it is not possible to admit new evidence in a hearing of an application for judicial review such as this one (see MZXHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622 at [8] );
 b) even where new evidence is to be admitted, the party seeking to adduce it must show that it could not with reasonable diligence have been adduced in trial, and the evidence must be such that very probably the result would have been different ( NASB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 24 at [42] - [43]);
 c) notwithstanding a) and b), where the Tribunal purports to make a finding of fact which is essential to its reasoning process (referred to on occasions as a jurisdictional fact), and there is no evidence to support the finding, then this may well constitute a jurisdictional error ( Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at [355] - [357], applied and analysed in SFGB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 at [19] - [20]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2007] FCAFC 94">17 No evidence was placed before the Court to explain why it had not been submitted to the primary judge that, if his Honour found that the warrant was not lawfully executed, he should exercise a discretion not to order the return to Mr Oke of the material seized. Nor was evidence placed before the Court touching on the issue of whether it was expedient in the interests of justice to allow the Commissioner to argue on appeal an issue not argued before the primary judge (see Carey-Hazell v Getz Bros &amp; Co (Aust) Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 48 at [53] ; MZXHY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 622). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2007] FMCA 705">Even if there were such application, it would not in any event be admissible (see MZXHY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 622).</sentence>
