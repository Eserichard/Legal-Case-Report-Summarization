18 On the basis of these and other decisions about preliminary options to purchase ( Re CCI Holdings Ltd [2007] FCA 832 , Re Bolsini Gold NL [2007] FCA 1668 and Re People Telecom Ltd [2009] FCA 180) , as well as cases about preliminary arrangements to secure favourable voting by influential shareholders ( Re Telewest Communications plc [2004] EWHC 924 ; [2004] BCC 342 ; Re Depfa Bank plc [2007] IEHC 463) , it was submitted that the court should not have any concern about the possibility that Marley should be considered as constituting a class distinct from all other Scheme Shareholders.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 2080">24 In my view, the presence of the exclusivity and break fee provisions in the MID should not stand in the way of the Anzon Energy Shareholders having the opportunity to consider the Anzon Energy Scheme: see Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [25] - [55] ; Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1186 at [31] - [35] ; Re Bolnisi Gold NL [2007] FCA 1668 at [25] - [26].

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 2078">1 At the first court hearing of this application under s 411 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) on 25 October 2007, I directed Bolnisi to convene a meeting of its members for the purpose of their considering, and if thought fit, agreeing (with or without modification), to a scheme of arrangement between Bolnisi and its members: see Bolnisi Gold NL, in the matter of Bolnisi Gold NL [2007] FCA 1668. (In these reasons for judgment I will use the forms of abbreviation that I used in the earlier reasons for judgment. ) 39 In concluding that the naked no vote break fee provision was not objectionable for the purposes of the application under s 411 of the Act, I had particular regard to the following considerations:
 
 &#8226; the affidavit evidence referred to earlier showed that the amount of the break fee would not exceed the amount of the costs and expenses of Coeur that would have been wasted if the Scheme was not agreed to by the Bolnisi shareholders;
 &#8226; the affidavit evidence demonstrated that the directors of Bolnisi had believed that they were acting in the best interests of the shareholders of Bolnisi in agreeing that the break fee should be payable in the naked no vote situation;
 &#8226; the break fee was a reciprocal one, in the sense that an identical amount was payable by Bolnisi and Coeur and that it was payable by Bolnisi and by Coeur if the Bolnisi shareholders or the Coeur shareholders respectively should fail to pass a resolution on which implementation of the Scheme depended;
 &#8226; it was important for Bolnisi to have the benefit of the Coeur break fee provision and it could do so only if it agreed to the Bolnisi break fee provision;
 &#8226; the amount of the break fee was less than the one percent "ceiling" referred to by the Takeovers Panel in its Guidance Note 7: Lock-up Devices and could not be regarded as so large as to be likely to coerce shareholders into agreeing to the Scheme; and
 &#8226; the affidavit evidence of Mr Seckold, which I set out in my earlier reasons for judgment ([2007] FCA 1668 at [25]), was to the effect that the no shop, no talk and break fee provisions were agreed following arm's length commercial negotiations over a period of one month in which both Bolnisi and Coeur were separately advised and represented by external legal advisers and financial advisers with extensive experience in transactions of the present kind; and that Mr Seckold believed that it was in the interests of Bolnisi's shareholders that Bolnisi's directors agreed to the inclusion of the provisions.
