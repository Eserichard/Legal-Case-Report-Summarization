<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1423">The background facts relevant to this long-running proceeding have been previously recounted: Wenkart v Pantzer (No 8) [2004] FCA 280 at [2] to [37] per Lindgren J; In the matter of Thomas Richard Wenkart, Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589 at [1] to [35] per Branson J; Wenkart v Pantzer [2009] FCA 1086 at [1] to [10]. They need not now be repeated.  That submission was apparently founded upon a statement previously made that the " sole function now being discharged is to attempt to bring together the various conclusions reached by others and to make orders to give effect to those conclusions ": [2010] FCA 866 at [115] . That statement was made after setting forth observations made by Branson J in Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589 where Her Honour had also said: 
 
 [47] In the taxation judgment at first instance I placed weight on the nature of certain costs orders against Dr Wenkart sought and obtained by Mr Pantzer in this Court. Order 62 r 4(1) of the Federal Court Rules provides that, subject to that Order, where under any order of the Court costs are to be paid to any person, that person is entitled to his costs to be taxed. Costs " to be taxed " in the context of O 62 r 4 means costs taxed in accordance with O 62 (O 62 r 1).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1408">Hapday Holdings has been involved in the proceeding from the outset. Although principal attention has been given to the agreement as noted by Beaumont J on 11 March 2002, it is of relevance to recall that His Honour also on that occasion noted that: 
 
 Hapday Holdings Pty Ltd ACN 001 185 253 hereby postpones mortgage [XX] over the land in paragraph 2 in favour of Warren Pantzer pursuant to the charge in paragraph 2. 
 

 
The circumstances in which the company came to be joined as a party to the proceeding were thereafter summarised as follows by Branson J in Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589: 
 
 
 [86] Hapday Holdings is a party interested in Mr Pantzer's application by way of cross-claim for an order that he be appointed as trustee for sale of the Paddington property. It was not originally named as a cross-respondent to the cross-claim. However, on 21 January 2005 I ordered that Hapday Holdings be joined as a cross-respondent with effect from that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 866">But the difficulty then confronting Mr Pantzer in recovering the amount claimed of $193,531.18 is the fact that as at 31 October 2002 he was not then entitled to " orders in aid " of the order made on 11 March 2002. So much was the conclusion of Branson J in her April 2008 judgment: Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478 , 6 ABC(NS) 37. Her Honour there relevantly concluded: 
 
 Position as at 31 October 2002 
 

 
 
 [84] ... the significance of the date 31 October 2002 is that it is the date of the filing of Mr Pantzer's deemed cross-claim seeking "an order in aid of [the Court's] order made on 11 March 2002 by appointing Warren Pantzer as Trustee for Sale of the [Paddington property]" (see [2007] FCA 1589 at [17] ). 
 

 
 
 [85] ...[I]t is, I think, uncontroversial that Dr Wenkart's agreements to pay the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is "lawfully entitled" from him is an agreement to pay within 28 days of the determination of the quantum of "the same". The charge over the Paddington property secures the payments by him of the relevant amount within that period of time. Her Honour also concluded that Dr Wenkart was not entitled to the orders he sought in his Notice of Motion as filed on 14 February 2007: [2007] FCA 1589 at [51] , 5 ABC(NS) 642 at 656.  The sum of $163,477.54 may also be traced back to the decision of Branson J delivered on 16 October 2007: Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589. In respect to this amount Her Honour referred to yet another earlier decision and then concluded: 
 
 [69] In Wenkart v Pantzer [2003] FCA 471 Beaumont J ruled that Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled to disbursements claimed by Cutler, Hughes and Harris. His Honour also noted that no appeal had been lodged from the decision of the taxing officer to issue a certificate of taxation on 17 February 2003 in respect of costs, including unpaid costs, in the total sum of $180,435.30. Mr Pantzer gave evidence that the amount of $163,477.54 remains owing by him to Cutler, Hughes and Harris in respect of these costs. I conclude that Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled to this amount. 
 

  That Motion was considered by Her Honour Justice Branson in Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589. In the course of her reasons, Her Honour noted that Dr Wenkart maintained that the claims were without foundation because: 
 
 " (a) The bankruptcy ended in March 2002;
 (b) Lindgren J made orders in [this proceeding] on 21 October 2003 requiring [Mr Pantzer] to make a final claim for remuneration by 23 October 2003 and a final claim for expenses by 22 October 2003;
 (c) [Mr Pantzer] is not entitled to claim remuneration and expenses as a trustee in bankruptcy for post annulment work as if he was a trustee in bankruptcy;
 (d) There is no agreement with [Dr Wenkart] to reimburse [Mr Pantzer] for his post annulment remuneration (if any) or his post annulment expenses (if any); and
 (e) [Mr Pantzer's] claims are personal costs which have nothing to do with the administration of the former bankrupt estate of [Dr Wenkart] (which ended in March 2002). " 
 

 
See: [2007] FCA 1589 at [34] .  The sum of $98,095.16 was found to be a sum to which Mr Pantzer was lawfully entitled in Branson J's April 2008 judgment. Her Honour then relevantly concluded: 
 
 [33] Additionally, as I noted in [2007] FCA 1589 at [64] , Mr Pantzer's claim for 85% of the sum of $115,406.07 (ie $98,095.16) has been the subject of litigation in other proceedings. In Wenkart v Pantzer (No 6) [2003] FCA 1210 published on 29 October 2003, Lindgren J dismissed a motion by Dr Wenkart for an extension of time within which to request that this claim be taxed. On that day Mr Pantzer's claim to be lawfully entitled to that sum was rendered effectively beyond challenge. The date upon which he is to be regarded as becoming lawfully entitled to the sum is, in my view, 14 days after Dr Wenkart became aware of the amount of the claim, namely 29 March 2002 (reg 8.09(1) of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 as then in force). This amount is reflected in the second unpaid amount listed in Mr Pantzer's schedule. 
 

  That Motion was considered by Her Honour Justice Branson in Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589. In the course of her reasons, Her Honour noted that Dr Wenkart maintained that the claims were without foundation because: 
 
 " (a) The bankruptcy ended in March 2002;
 (b) Lindgren J made orders in [this proceeding] on 21 October 2003 requiring [Mr Pantzer] to make a final claim for remuneration by 23 October 2003 and a final claim for expenses by 22 October 2003;
 (c) [Mr Pantzer] is not entitled to claim remuneration and expenses as a trustee in bankruptcy for post annulment work as if he was a trustee in bankruptcy;
 (d) There is no agreement with [Dr Wenkart] to reimburse [Mr Pantzer] for his post annulment remuneration (if any) or his post annulment expenses (if any); and
 (e) [Mr Pantzer's] claims are personal costs which have nothing to do with the administration of the former bankrupt estate of [Dr Wenkart] (which ended in March 2002). " 
 

 
See: [2007] FCA 1589 at [34] .  As explained in the September 2009 reasons for decision, the dispute has its origins almost a decade earlier in October 1999. An order had been made sequestrating the estate of Dr Wenkart. Mr Pantzer was appointed the trustee in bankruptcy by an order of this Court on 28 October 1999. The bankruptcy was annulled on 15 March 2002. An overview of the history of the litigation may be found in a number of judgments: e.g., Wenkart v Pantzer (No 8) [2004] FCA 280 at [2] to [37] [2004] FCA 280 ; , 135 FCR 422 per Lindgren J; Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589 at [1] to [35], 5 ABC(NS) 642 at 644 to 652 per Branson J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1086">This will require, as a first step, the identification of the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66 (ie the total amount received by Mr Pantzer as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate). If the parties are unable to reach agreement on this question, I propose to make an order for the making of an inquiry by a Registrar (O 39 r 2 and r 9 of the Federal Court Rules ).

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 I have twice before published reasons for judgment in this matter; Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589 published on 16 October 2007 and Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478 published on 11 April 2008. These reasons for judgment should be read together with my earlier reasons for judgment. 2 The history and subject matter of this proceeding is summarised in Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589 at [2] - [35]. As I noted in Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478 at [1] - [8], no agreement was reached between the parties as to the orders appropriate to be made to give effect to my reasons for judgment of 16 October 2007. Indeed, after hearing further from the parties, I accepted that I had not dealt with all outstanding issues between the parties. 28 I discussed the above issue in the reasons for judgment of 11 April 2008 at [59]-[82]. As is there made plain, I am satisfied that Lindgren J made the orders dated 21 October 2003 in the terms that he did in the belief that certain advice given to him by Mr Pantzer's then counsel was accurate (see [80]-[81] of the reasons for judgment of 11 April 2008). Evidence tending to establish that the advice given to Lindgren J was inaccurate might provide a basis for the variation of the orders made by Lindgren J. In earlier reasons for judgment I have drawn attention to the importance in this proceeding of the effect of the orders made by Lindgren J and to the possibility of an application being made for those orders to be varied (see, for example, Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589 at [27] -28]). No such application has been made. Evidence of the kind that Mr Pantzer now seeks leave to adduce would not impact on the proper construction of the orders made by his Honour. The true meaning of the orders made by his Honour is to be determined by reference to the meaning that his Honour intended the orders to have. His Honour's intention can be ascertained by reference to the transcript of the hearing before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 478">1 On 16 October 2007 I published reasons for judgment in this matter ( Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589]). On that day I stood the proceeding over to a date to be fixed for the purpose of making orders giving effect to those reasons. Having regard to the complex history of the matter I additionally invited the parties to draw to my attention any issues on which I had inadvertently failed to rule. 78 The context in which Lindgren J came to make orders in this matter on 21 October 2003 was that the docket judge, who was then Beaumont J, was unwell. Lindgren J was thus more than usually dependent on information provided to him by the parties' respective legal representatives. On 11 March 2002 Beaumont J had made the consent orders that are set out in [2007] FCA 1589 at [15] . Those orders provided, in effect, that Dr Wenkart charged the Paddington property to secure the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer was, or might become, lawfully entitled as trustee of his bankrupt estate and recorded that Dr Wenkart "agreed to pay the same within 28 days of determination of the quantum of the same or at such other time as the parties may agree". I observe, incidentally, that there is no suggestion that the parties have agreed another time. 59 However, Dr Wenkart's primary submission concerning the costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris is that this proceeding has been conducted on the basis of an agreement by Mr Pantzer to have the bills of costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris taxed, and that this agreement is reflected in the orders made by Lindgren J on 21 October 2003. Those orders are reproduced in [2007] FCA 1589 at [22] . It is therefore necessary to review the history of the dealings between Mr Pantzer and Dr Wenkart so far as they touch on the legal costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris. 85 As noted in [2007] FCA 1589 at [39] - [44], the Full Court disagreed with the construction initially given by me to the orders made on 11 March 2002 and 21 October 2003. Nonetheless it is, I think, uncontroversial that Dr Wenkart's agreements to pay the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is "lawfully entitled" from him is an agreement to pay within 28 days of the determination of the quantum of "the same". The charge over the Paddington property secures the payments by him of the relevant amount within that period of time. That is, Mr Pantzer is not entitled to exercise rights under the charge created by order 2 of the consent orders until Dr Wenkart defaults on his agreement to pay. By filing his cross-claim Mr Pantzer sought to exercise rights in reliance on that charge. 33 Additionally, as I noted in [2007] FCA 1589 at [64] , Mr Pantzer's claim for 85% of the sum of $115,406.07 (ie $98,095.16) has been the subject of litigation in other proceedings. In Wenkart v Pantzer (No 6) [2003] FCA 1210 published on 29 October 2003, Lindgren J dismissed a motion by Dr Wenkart for an extension of time within which to request that this claim be taxed. On that day Mr Pantzer's claim to be lawfully entitled to that sum was rendered effectively beyond challenge. The date upon which he is to be regarded as becoming lawfully entitled to the sum is, in my view, 14 days after Dr Wenkart became aware of the amount of the claim, namely 29 March 2002 (reg 8.09(1) of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 as then in force). This amount is reflected in the second unpaid amount listed in Mr Pantzer's schedule. 79 The orders made by Lindgren J on 21 October 2003 (see [2007] FCA 1589 at [22] ), although made after the filing of the cross-claim, were intended to enable the amount to which Mr Pantzer was "lawfully entitled" as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate to be quantified. Those orders in effect, obliged Mr Pantzer to require the persons who had provided services to him with respect to Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate (other than Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris) to supply bills of costs pursuant to s 167 of the Bankruptcy Act and additionally obliged Mr Pantzer to notify Dr Wenkart of his claim for remuneration in respect of services provided after the annulment of Dr Wenkart's bankruptcy. I observe incidentally that the absence of any reference in the order to Mr Pantzer's entitlement to remuneration for services provided before the annulment of Dr Wenkart's bankruptcy supports my above conclusion that Mr Pantzer's entitlement in that regard had by that time been quantified. His Honour noted that Dr Wenkart conceded that upon completion of taxation of the claims for costs and remuneration referred to in the orders, the amount taxed would be amounts to which Mr Pantzer was lawfully entitled within the meaning of the orders made on 11 March 2002. 84 As mentioned above, the significance of the date 31 October 2002 is that it is the date of the filing of Mr Pantzer's deemed cross-claim seeking "an order in aid of [the Court's] order made on 11 March 2002 by appointing Warren Pantzer as Trustee for Sale of the [Paddington property]" (see [2007] FCA 1589 at [17] ).  57 The accuracy of Mr Pantzer's schedule so far as it concerns payments made to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris is not challenged by Dr Wenkart. Payments by Mr Pantzer to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris in the aggregate amount of $380,225 are evidenced by a list of cash payments ("the Cash Payments List") made during the period of the administration by Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate provided to Dr Wenkart's then solicitors (Bruce &amp; Stewart) by Mr Pantzer's then solicitors (Sally Nash &amp; Co) under cover of a letter dated 7 October 2004 and placed in evidence by Dr Wenkart. At the heart of the dispute between Dr Wenkart and Mr Pantzer concerning the costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris is the question of whether all of the bills of costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris are required to be taxed to determine the total quantum of the costs that Mr Pantzer is entitled to recover from Dr Wenkart (see order 1 of the consent orders made on 11 March 2002 which are reproduced in [2007] FCA 1589 at [15] ).</sentence>
