<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 600">The power of this Court to appoint a receiver is contained in s 57 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (" Federal Court of Australia Act ") (see also Order 26 of the Federal Court Rules ) and is conditioned on whether it appears to the Court to be just or convenient to do so. The power is not confined to a closed class of circumstances. Ultimately, the general ground upon which a Court appoints a receiver is, as has been said in many cases, the protection or preservation of property for the benefit of persons who have an interest in it: see, for example, Martyniuk v King [2000] VSC 319 at [14] per Warren J; University of Western Australia v Gray (No 6) [2006] FCA 1825 at [71] - [72] per French J (as his Honour then was). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1231">The relevant principles may be summarised as follows: The power of the Court to appoint a receiver is statutory (see ss 23 and 57 of the FCA and s 1323 of the Act) but has its origins as an equitable remedy: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 6) [2006] FCA 1825 at [71] ; In addition to the powers given to receivers by s 420 of the Act, the Court has the power to authorise a receiver to do any act or thing which the parties might do: see O 26 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules . Examples include investing the receiver with power to conduct legal proceedings and to appoint lawyers to act ( Gray (No 6) , to settle such proceedings ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Letten (No 6) [2010] FCA 1048) or to enter into formal agreements by deed ( Parker Re Purcom No 34 Pty Ltd (in Liq) [2009] FCA 1359 ; (2009) 262 ALR 85) ; The circumstances in which the Court may exercise its power to appoint receivers, and the conditions which may be attached to that appointment, are not closed: Gray (No 6) at [71]. As explained by French J in Gray (No 6) : 
 
 
 There may be many circumstances of considerable diversity which would warrant such an order and it is important that the discretion not be unnecessarily confined by any particular line of cases to which it has been applied. 
 
 

 The power to appoint a receiver must carry with it an implied power to give directions with respect to the discharge of the functions for which the appointment is made: Mariconte v Batiste [2000] NSWSC 288 ; (2000) 48 NSWLR 724 at [75] per Austin J. The function of the Court on an application for directions from Court appointed receivers is analogous to its function with respect to a provisional liquidator: Mariconte at [76] citing Sanderson v Classic Car Insurances Pty Ltd (1985) 10 ACLR 115 and Law Society of New South Wales v Milios [1999] NSWSC 1272 ; (1999) 48 NSWLR 409. It is appropriate for the Court to give directions that provide guidance to the receivers on matters of law and on the reasonableness of the contemplated exercise of discretion: Mariconte at [76]. However, such directions should not be given where the answer to the question would require the Court to make or to condone a particular commercial judgment: Re One.Tel Networks Holdings Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 1065 ; (2001) 40 ACSR 83 at [32] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1048">Having regard to the terms of that Order, the Receivers seek an order under ss 601EE and 1323 (5) of the Act that they are justified in settling the Proceeding on the terms set out in the Settlement Deed. Order 26 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules provides the Court may authorise a receiver to do any act or thing which the parties or any of them might do if of full age and capacity. That rule permits the Court to invest the receiver with powers, including the power to conduct legal proceedings, to appoint lawyers to act and, subject to the Court's approval, to settle such proceedings: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 6) [2006] FCA 1825. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 125">In this Court, a power is conferred by O 26 r 1 to appoint a receiver who, subject to any contrary order, is to have the powers of a receiver and also those of a manager. That rule would not appear directly to authorise the appointment of a manager simpliciter but I do not doubt that the power in s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) extends to such an appointment in an appropriate case: cf. University of Western Australia v Gray (No. 6) [2006] FCA 1825 at [71] per French J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1359">Moreover, in so far as the Receiver makes the application under O 26 r 7 of the Rules, the Court has power to approve the Receiver entering into the Deed: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 6) [2006] FCA 1825 at [66] ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Ludgates Corporate and Advisory Services Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1368 at [23] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCA 498">On 22 February 2007 UWA and CRI reached a settlement in these proceedings. CRI was acting by a court-appointed receiver, Mr Mark Conlon, whose powers to enter into a settlement on behalf of CRI were subject to approval of the settlement by the Court . The receiver was initially appointed as receiver of Sirtex shares held by CRI. His powers were extended on 22 December 2006 : University of Western Australia v Gray (No 6) [2006] FCA 1825. The settlement agreement was subsequently approved by Graham J: University of Western Australia v Gray (No 10) [2007] FCA 377. That approval was the subject of an unsuccessful challenge by Dr Gray and Sirtex in an appeal to the Full Court: Gray v Cancer Research Institute Inc [2007] FCAFC 149. An application for special leave to appeal to the High Court is pending. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 141">30 In Yunghanns v Candoora No 19 Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] VSC 300 ; (2000) 35 ACSR 34 , Warren J at 46-50 [64]-[77] discussed the legal principles applicable when a Court is asked to appoint a receiver and manager of the assets of a trust. I gratefully adopt her Honour's explanation. See also the discussion by French J in The University of Western Australia v Gray (No 6) [2006] FCA 1825 at [71] - [73]. Both Warren J in Yunghanns and French J in Gray , in essence, said that the general ground upon which a Court appoints a receiver and manager is ultimately for the protection or preservation of property for the benefit of persons who have an interest in it. There are many examples of such orders contained in the discussion by Warren J referred to above. A recent example is provided by Cadura Investments Ltd v Rototek Pty Ltd [2004] WASC 150. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] FCA 1608">72 Subject to hearing the parties I consider that the better course would be to appoint a receiver to deal with the funds which are subject to Gray J's order. This would seem to be an appropriate case for the appointment of a receiver, if not under s 57(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act , under s 23 of that Act: see The University of Western Australia v Gray (No 6) [2006] FCA 1825 at [71] . This case bears many of the features which led Austin J, in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Burke [2000] NSWSC 694 , to appoint a receiver. His Honour said (at [8]):
 
 "Without wishing to lay down any general rules, it appears to me that the extraordinary step of appointing a receiver may be justified, even though Mareva Orders are in place, in a case where there is real doubt about the existence and location of assets such as investments, and about the number and identity of claimants and the nature of their claims, and additionally the defendants are engaged in business activities which entail that any Mareva Orders must allow assets to be turned over in the course of business. Where these circumstances exist in combination, and especially where there are allegations of serious fraud involved, the Court may conclude, as I do in this case, that the Mareva Orders are not enough to ensure that the assets are preserved and protected, and indeed identified and brought in for the benefit of investors. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FCA 633">8 On 22 December 2006, French J granted to Mr Mark Conlan, as a Court appointed receiver to CRI, powers to determine the position CRI should take in the proceedings and to enter into a settlement agreement. The orders made by French J also required that any settlement reached by CRI be subject to the approval of the Court ( The University of Western Australia v Gray (No 8) [2006] FCA 1825). </sentence>
