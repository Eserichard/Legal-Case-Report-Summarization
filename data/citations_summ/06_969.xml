<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 881">Proceedings have been transferred from this Court to the Federal Magistrates Court, including claims made for unlawful termination of employment brought pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth): e.g., Melville v Macquarie University [2006] FCA 1761 , 161 IR 30. Madgwick J there transferred the proceedings despite the opposition of one of the parties. Instances can also be provided where a proceeding is retained in this Court by reason of, for example, a docket Judge having an existing familiarity with the claims being made and where the proceeding can be more expeditiously dealt with in this Court: Cutler v Trustee for McKenzie &amp; Baird Unit Trust [2010] FCA 714 at [48] . In circumstances where the parties consent to the making of such an order, it has been said that such consent is decisive: Rixon v Business Parcel Express Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 969 at [3] . Instances can be provided where an order has been made where the amount the subject of a claim, as is the case in the present proceeding, is a relatively modest amount: Garage Wholesalers Pty Ltd v Engineering Software Solutions Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 361 at [6] . The amount of the claim, however, always remains but one of the matters to be taken into account when exercising the discretion conferred by s 32AB. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 964">
 [8] Further O 82 r 4---8 of the Rules outlines considerations which may be taken into account in addition to the factors to which the Court must have regard under s 32AB(6) of the Act. In summary, the Court may take into account the following factors: 
 (a) whether the proceeding or appeal is likely to involve questions of general importance, such that it would be desirable for there to be a decision of the Federal Court on one or more of the points in issue; 
 (b) whether, if the proceeding or appeal is transferred, it is likely to be heard and determined at less cost and more convenience to the parties than if the proceeding or appeal is not transferred; 
 (c) whether the proceeding or appeal is likely to be heard and determined earlier in the FMC; 
 (d) the wishes of the parties. 

Similarly in Rixon v Business Parcel Express Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 969 at [2] Jacobson J stated:
 
 [2] The court may transfer proceedings on its own initiative, see s 32AB(2)(b) and O 82 r 6. The primary considerations for the court in exercising its discretion are whether the Federal Magistrates Court has jurisdiction and whether the Federal Magistrates Court has the resources to hear and determine the proceedings and whether a transfer is in the interests of justice.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 763">The power conferred by s 32AB has been exercised on a number of occasions and in diverse situations. In Garage Wholesalers Pty Ltd v Engineering Software Solutions Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 361 , McKerracher J transferred a proceeding alleging a contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). His Honour considered that the proceeding involved a claim for a moderate amount and that it was likely that it could be dealt with more expeditiously and less formally in the Federal Magistrates Court. See also Kurniadi v Loh [2002] FCA 1021 , 193 ALR 253. A further instance is provided by Ozluk v Australian Turkish &amp; Kurdish Community Services Co-Operative Ltd [2008] FCA 352 where Graham J transferred an application brought pursuant to s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth). See also Beetham v Cortra Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 150. In Melville v Macquarie University [2006] FCA 1761 Madgwick J transferred an application brought under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) for unlawful termination of employment. See also Sheikholeslami v University of New South Wales [2006] FCA 712 ; Rixon v Business Parcell Express Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 969. Applications arising under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) have also been the subject of orders made pursuant to s 32AB: Nadu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 571 ; Hong Bo Su v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1355.  The power to make an order tansferring a proceeding to the Federal Magistrates Court is a discretionary power (s 32AB(1)) which may be exercised upon the Court's own initiative (s 32AB(2)(b)). It is thus a power which may be exercised even though an applicant may oppose such an order being made: e.g. Rahman v Dayeh [2006] FCA 1362. But where the parties consent to the making of such an order, Jacobson J has observed that such consent is " decisive ": Rixon v Business Parcel Express Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 969 at [3] . </sentence>
