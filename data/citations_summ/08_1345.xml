<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 121">3 The ground of appeal to the Federal Court from the Tribunal's orders was an alleged denial of procedural fairness because the Tribunal proceeded with a hearing in the absence of the appellant. The Tribunal gave reasons for taking that course, which are set out verbatim in the reasons of the primary judge (see [2008] FCA 1345 at [15] ). In his reasons for dismissing the appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act, the primary judge outlined the history of the proceeding before the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 113">3 The appellant appealed to this Court from the decision of the Tribunal, pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act"). The appeal was heard by North J. The appellant was represented by two counsel, who appeared pro bono. His Honour gave judgment on 13 August 2008. See Cook v ASP Ship Management Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1345. His Honour dismissed the appellant's appeal from the Tribunal's decision with costs. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 965">There will be many circumstances in which proceeding in the absence of an applicant will not afford procedural fairness. Such an example may be found in Bourke, Michael Vincent v Companies Auditors &amp; Liquidators Disciplinary Board [1998] FCA 742. In that case, the applicant had telephoned the AAT on the date of the hearing stating that he was unwell but requesting a hearing by telephone link which was declined and no adjournment was offered. Although Mr Fazio also expressed that he was unwell, he did not request any deferral of the hearing and did not offer to provide any medical evidence to support the assertion. Some such medical evidence has now been made available in the course of this appeal where other requests for adjournments have been made. In Cook v ASP Ship Management Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1345 , the Court concluded that the AAT was not obliged to simply accept an applicant's assertions in favour of an adjournment without further elaboration. The Court also had regard to events which had preceded the AAT decision when it concluded that there had been no breach of the obligations under s 39(1) of the AAT Act. </sentence>
