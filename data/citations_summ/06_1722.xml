<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VSC 385">[28] His Honour referred to the decision in the Federal Court in Kortz Limited v Data Acquisition Pty Ltd [29] where Greenwood J held that exhibits to affidavits must be served to comply with the requirements of s 459G(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSC 288">29 Although it is not the function of the Court on an application to set aside a statutory demand to resolve contested questions of fact or determine where the merits lie in any contest, [24] the Court must have regard to the bank evidence in considering whether a genuine dispute has been shown.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] NSWSC 927">15 Likewise, in Kortz Ltd v Data Acquisition Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1722 ; (2006) 155 FCR 556 , Greenwood J of the Federal Court said that there needed to be an identity between the material as filed and the material served (at [33]) so that the defendant was informed precisely of the final form of the material that the plaintiff was relying upon in seeking to advance the merits of the application (at [35]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1443">8 The manner in which the Court approaches the task is also not in dispute. The Court does not resolve contested questions of fact or determine where the merits lie in any contest: Kortz Ltd v Data Acquisition Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1722 ; (2006) 155 FCR 556 at [40] . The Court determines only whether the supporting affidavits filed and served by West depose to facts from which the Court is able to conclude that a genuine dispute exists. As Young J said in John Holland Construction 14 ACSR at 253, something between mere assertion and the proof of the existence of the disputed debt is required: see also Micha International Pty Limited v Jong Seol Lee [2008] NSWSC 921 at [5] and Solarite Air Conditioning Pty Ltd v York International Australia Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 411 at [23] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 61">10 The Court's role is to determine whether a genuine dispute exists. That issue is determined at the time the Court hears the application: Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358 at [16] . The manner in which the Court approaches the task is also not in dispute. The Court does not resolve contested questions of fact. The Court does not determine where the merits lie in any contest: Kortz Ltd v Data Acquisition Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1722 ; (2006) 155 FCR 556 at [40] . The Court determines whether the supporting affidavits filed and served by Ox Operations depose to facts from which the Court is able to conclude that a genuine dispute exists. As Young J said in John Holland Construction and Engineering Pty Ltd v Kilpatrick Green Pty Ltd (1994) 14 ACSR 250 at 253, something between mere assertion and the proof of the existence of the disputed debt is required.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] NSWSC 835"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 252">7 The defendant, apart from responding to all three grounds relied upon by the plaintiff, also contended that the plaintiff had failed to comply with s 459G(3) of the Act, compliance with which goes to jurisdiction. The defendant contended that as a result, the jurisdiction of the court had not been enlivened and the court could not make an order setting aside the demand either pursuant to s 459H(3) or s 459J(1)(a) or (b). The merits of that contention are dealt with at [16] to [37] of the reasons for judgment ( Kortz Ltd v Data Acquisition Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1722). </sentence>
