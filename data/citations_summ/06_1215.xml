<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 710">I discussed the limitations on the Court's power to accept an undertaking in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Auspine Ltd [2006] FCA 1215 ; (2006) 235 ALR 95 at 104-109 [24] - [35] . Although the undertaking is expressed in somewhat general terms, I considered that I had both the power to accept it and that it was appropriate for me to do so. In reaching that conclusion, I had regard to the decisions of the Full Court of this Court in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2007] FCAFC 146 ; (2007) 161 FCR 513 (" Dataline "). </sentence>
