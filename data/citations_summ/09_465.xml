<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 1161">That delay gives rise to an objection to competency taken by the Minister based upon the effect of s.477(1) of the Migration Act , as amended by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2009 (Cth). A 35 day time limit arises from the date of the decision which is challenged. Under transitional provisions concerning decisions made prior to the date of commencement on 15 March 2009, the 35 day period is deemed to expire around 21 April 2009 (see SZLUC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 378 at [10] , and Rinka v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 465 at [5]-[6]). Mr Yu, therefore, needs to obtain, and has applied for, an order of the Court extending time from that date, pursuant to s.477(2). This can only be granted if "the Federal Magistrates Court is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice to make the order" . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 823">The applicant was able to avail himself of a transitional 'window of opportunity' to invoke this Court's jurisdiction, unhampered by the time limit under s.477 of the Migration Act , which was opened up by recent amendments (see SZLUC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 378 at [10] , and Rinka v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FCA 465 at [5] - [6]). However, the Court retains a discretion to refuse relief based upon conduct of the applicant which appears inconsistent with his belated invocation of that jurisdiction. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 886">Mr Rinka filed the application commencing this proceeding on 1 May 2009. On 5 May 2009, Jagot J granted an interlocutory injunction restraining the Minister from removing Mr Rinka from Australia pending further or other order: see Rinka v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 465.
