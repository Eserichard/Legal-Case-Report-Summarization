<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] QCA 295">[32] In Silberberg v Builders Collective of Australia Inc, [4] Giles J, after discussing the cases relied on by counsel for the respondents, expressed the view that in defamation or copyright cases, the administrator of a website would be likely to attract liability in respect of materials posted on the website by others even without knowledge of their content if the administrator: 
 
"... chose to conduct an open anonymous forum available to the world without any system for scrutinising what was posted.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 502">I have taken this approach in considering the application made to me. The case made by both the applicant and the respondent is that a transfer is desirable in the interests of the administration of justice because the proceeding is likely to involve a question of general importance, such that it would be desirable for there to be a decision of the Federal Court on one or more of the points in issue. The law relating to the use of websites for the purposes of commentary so far as it touches claims made under the RDA does not appear to be settled. Both parties to this proceeding accept that the correctness and applicability of a decision of Gyles J in Silberberg v The Builders Collective of Australia Inc [2007] FCA 1512 would be an issue of significant controversy. In that case Gyles J concluded that a failure to remove offensive material from the website within a reasonable time was an act contrary to s.18C(1)(a) of the RDA. His Honour also found that it was necessary for the applicant to show that the failure to remove the offensive material was attributable to the race or ethnic origin of the applicant. Although his Honour made reference and considered cases which discussed whether a person who allowed comments to be posted on its website could be considered to have " published " those comments; Godfrey v Demon Internet Ltd [1999] EWHC QB 244 ; [2001] QB 201 ; [1999] 4 All ER 342 ; [2000] 3 WLR 1020 ; Kaplan v Go Daddy Group [2005] NSWSC 636 ; Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Cooper [2005] FCA 972 ; (2005) 150 FCR 1 ; Bunt v Tilley [2006] 3 All ER 336 ; Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Limited [1996] HCA 38 ; (1996) 186 CLR 574 , he did not make a finding that the placing of the material on the internet constituted publication. At [34] his Honour said: "Based on these authorities it is clear enough that failure to remove known offensive material would be caught by s 18C(1)(a) bearing in mind s 3(3). " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FMCA 897">In Silberberg v The Builders Collective of Australia Inc [56] [2007] FCA 1512 , also a racial discrimination case, Gyles J made no award of damages, only for costs and for certain restraints to be imposed. Similar orders were made by Conti J in Jeremy Jones, and on behalf of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry v The Bible Believers Church [2007] FCA 55. </sentence>
