<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 291">The expression "good faith" can apply to the honest use of a descriptive word even if it is the same as, or deceptively similar to, a word used in a registered trade mark. Thus, in Mayne Industries Pty Ltd v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 27 ; (2008) 166 FCR 312 , Greenwood J held that the use of a three dimensional S shape to describe the functional role of a fence dropper was not use of that sign as a trade mark, but as a description of the essential functional feature of the item in question. However, in Cantarella , Einfeld J held that the word "Vitoria", to indicate the geographical origin of coffee imported from the Port of Vitoria in Brazil, was not used as a descriptive word to describe the character or quality of the goods and, therefore, was not protected by s 64(1)(b) of the 1955 Act in relation to a registered trade mark for the word "Vittoria". Further, in Caterpillar Loader Hire (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co [1983] FCA 145 ; (1983) 77 FLR 139 , the Full Court of this Court held that the use of the word "Caterpillar" in the respondent's business name: "Willoughby's Caterpillar Loader Hire Service" was not descriptive of the character or quality of the respondent's services, but constituted use as a trade mark. Franki J observed (at 142) that: 
 
 ... This section [s 64(1)(b)] is applicable if the acts alleged to constitute an infringement are the use "in good faith of a description of the character or quality of [the defendant's] ... services". It seems clear that [section] only applies where descriptive words are used descriptively in relation to the goods the subject of the relevant registration.

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1467">49 Little guidance as to the proper application of s 88(1) can be obtained from Toddler Kindy Gymbaroo Pty Ltd v Gymboree Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 618 ; (2000) 100 FCR 166 as no party argued in that case that s 88(1) did not vest a true discretion in a prescribed court. In Mayne Industries Pty Limited v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Limited [2008] FCA 27 ; (2008) 75 IPR 102 at [75] Greenwood J said of s 87(1) of the Trade Marks Act:
 Section 87(1) confers a discretion on the court to order cancellation of the registration of the trade mark. That discretion is to be exercised according to its terms and, where appropriate, settled principle. The discretion is to be exercised subject to s 87(2) which identifies circumstances in which the court might decide not to make an order. 48 Subsequently, in Health World Ltd v Shui-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 Jacobson J at [203]-[205] observed:
 The power to order rectification under s 88 is expressed in discretionary terms. However, in EOS Australia Pty Ltd v Expo Tomei Pty Ltd (1998) 42 IPR 277 at 287, Branson J expressed the view that the terms of s 89 suggest that s 88(1) does not vest a true discretion in the court. In my opinion, there is force in Branson J's view because s 88(1) is subject to s 89, and s 89 confers a discretion, to be exercised in limited circumstances, not to grant an application for rectification. Nevertheless, this approach has not been taken in other courts: see, for example, Toddler Kindy Gymbaroo Pty Ltd v Gymbaree Pty Ltd (2000) 100 FCR 166 ; 51 IPR 1 ; [2000] FCA 618 at [97] ; Mayne Industries Pty Ltd v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Ltd (2008) 75 IPR 102 ; [2008] FCA 27 at [75] . Lahore observes at [57,155] that s 89 may be seen as codifying the case law on blameworthy conduct; accordingly, it deals with the circumstances in which a particular discretion may be exercised without detracting from the general discretion found in s 88(1). I propose to proceed on that basis. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1257">38 Section 33(2A) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) ( the Acts Interpretation Act ), which was inserted in 1987, applies to the 1990 Act. Section 33(2A) provides that where an Act assented to after the commencement of that provision provides that a person, court or body may do a particular act or thing, and the word may is used, the Act or thing may be done at the discretion of the person, court or body. Under s 2 of the Acts Interpretation Act that definition will apply except so far as the contrary intention appears. The definition would indicate that at least a discretion is conferred on the Court as to whether and what relief, within s 128(1), should be granted. The perhaps more difficult question is how far that discretion extends, and what considerations are relevant to its exercise. (See also New South Wales Diary Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co-operative Company Ltd [1990] HCA 60 ; (1990) 171 CLR 363 at 391, EOS Australia Pty Ltd v Expo Tomei Pty Ltd (1998) 42 IPR 277 at 287, Maine Industries Pty Ltd v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 27 ; (2008) 166 FCR 312 at 342-3) . </sentence>
