<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 141">Courts are generally more reluctant to order a self-represented litigant to pay costs on an indemnity basis. In this case I am not satisfied that a self represented litigant such as Mr Zoltaszek should have known that there was no prospect of success or that he acted in a high-handed manner, proceeded vexatiously or made allegations which ought not to have been made, such that his rejection of the offer of settlement made at that time or any other circumstances warranted an award of indemnity costs. I have borne in mind that Mr Zoltaszek is a self-represented litigant lacking knowledge of the law, the practice of the court and, possibly, objectivity (see to similar effect Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 8) [2006] FCA 1537 and Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 1594). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSCA 336">34 The question remains whether, motive aside, Reverend Klement commenced or continued a case which was so hopeless as to demonstrate 'some wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law'. In this context, the Court must make allowance for Reverend Klement's lack of knowledge of the law, unfamiliarity with court practices and lack of objectivity as an unrepresented litigant, while also acknowledging and giving fair weight to the hardship and expense to which the respondent has been subjected in defending the appeal. [9] In the special circumstances of this case, we are not satisfied that the appeal was commenced or continued in wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law, notwithstanding that it was fundamentally misconceived. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] VSC 531">
 
 86 Separately and in addition, the Roads Corporation asserts that Mr Love made and pursued serious allegations which did not have any foundation and ought never have been made. In particular, it refers to allegations of abuse of process, of contempt and of misfeasance in public office. It submits that for such "high handed presumption" [101] and for the making of "wild and contumelious allegations" [102] , an order for solicitor and client costs ought to be made. Indeed, it says, mounting and maintaining a case without merit is sufficient reason to order costs on a solicitor and client basis. [103] 
 
 Consideration </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] VSC 174">36 The authorities reveal a number of possible bases for granting indemnity costs, including the making of false allegations of fraud, [24] conduct causing loss of time to both parties, [25] conduct amounting to contempt of court, [26] failing to discover documents in a timely manner, [27] mounting a case without merit [28] and, in general, any conduct undertaken in wilful disregard of the established law and for tactical purposes only. [29] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 1403">61 Although this Court has expressed greater reluctance to order indemnity costs against an unrepresented litigant, it may do so: Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 8) [2006] FCA 1537 at [20] and [26] per Kenny J. In Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 1594 Heerey J relevantly observed:
 [7] In Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd [2006] FCA 1537 Kenny J at [26] recently noted that courts have from time to time overcome a reluctance to order indemnity costs against self-represented litigants: Bhagat v Global Custodians [2002] FCAFC 51 and Ogawa v The University of Melbourne (No 2) [2004] FCA 1275. Kenny J considered the competing interests in determining whether to make an award of indemnity costs against a self-represented litigant. A lack of knowledge of the law, unfamiliarity with court practice and a lack of objectivity are common traits of unrepresented litigants. A person's ability to get redress should not depend on lawyerly skills or an ability to pay for legal representation. However, the Court owes a duty to all parties to ensure that the trial is conducted in a fair and timely fashion (at [28]) and without significant difficulties and unnecessary expense for the parties against whom an unrepresented litigant proceeds. see Bhagat v Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Life Assurance Australia Ltd [2000] NSWSC 159 at [13] per Hodgson CJ. ...

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] VSC 316">107 Further in Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No.4), [84] Heerey J said as follows: 
 
 In Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No.8), [85] Kenny J [86] recently noted that courts have from time to time overcome a reluctance to order indemnity costs against self-represented litigants: Bhagat v Global Custodians [87] and Ogawa v The University of Melbourne (No.2). [88] Kenny J considered the competing interests in determining whether to make an award of indemnity costs against a self-represented litigant. A lack of knowledge of the law, unfamiliarity with court practice and a lack of objectivity are common traits of unrepresented litigants. A person's ability to redress should not depend on lawyerly skills or an ability to pay for legal representation. However, the court owes a duty to all parties to ensure that the trial is conducted in a fair and timely fashion [89] and without significant difficulties and unnecessary expense for the parties against whom an unrepresented litigant proceeds: see Bhagat v Royal and Sun Alliance Life Assurance Australia. [90] In this instance the expense, delay and difficulties caused by the applicant's fraudulent and unreasonable behaviour overshadow any limitations that arose from his status as self-represented.
