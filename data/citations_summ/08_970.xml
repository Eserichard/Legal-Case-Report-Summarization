<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] ATMO 102">The choice of forum and grounds for this matter are thus inappropriate. In Edwards v Liquid Engineering 2003 Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 970 Gordon J stated at paragraph 8: 
Having considered the evidence led, and submissions made, I was poised to answer that question in the affirmative and uphold the appeal, on the basis that "good faith" for the purposes of s 92(4) requires no more than genuine intent to use a mark for commercial purposes; it does not involve any element of honesty or subjective good intentions: see generally E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 at [187] - [192] (examining the meaning of "good faith" under related provisions of the TMA). However, during the course of the hearings it became apparent that what LE 2003 really wanted, and should have applied for in the first place, was the expungement of the registrations by Edwards under s 88 of the TMA on the basis that Edwards was not the owner of the unregistered marks: ss 52 and 58 of the TMA. I therefore delayed giving judgment in VID 934 of 2006 so that a separate application could be brought on that basis and the matters resolved together. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] ATMO 65">It is questionable whether or not this evidence goes to the 'good faith' of the opponent, given the interpretation of the expression by the Federal Court. Mr. Ziehlke referred to previous decisions of the Registrar including Bunter v Hoborama LLC [13] and Edwards v Liquid Engineering [14] . However, the interpretation of the expression 'in good faith' favoured in those decisions before the Registrar have been superseded by the comments in the Federal Court appeal to the latter case [15] , where it was said (emphasis added): 
...I was poised to answer that question in the affirmative and uphold the appeal, on the basis that "good faith" for the purposes of s 92(4) requires no more than genuine intent to use a mark for commercial purposes; it does not involve any element of honesty or subjective good intentions : see generally E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 at [187] - [192]...

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] ATMO 58">This purpose was again confirmed in Edwards v Liquid Engineering 2003 Pty Ltd. [9] During the hearing of the current matter there was some discussion between the parties regarding the facts surrounding the appeal to the Full Federal Court in Liquideng Farm Supplies Pty Ltd v Liquid Engineering 2003 Pty Ltd [10] and whether those facts are analogous to this matter. While I agree that the facts of the current matter can be distinguished from those in Liquideng, the overall principles addressed by Justice Gordon in the Federal Court and subsequently by the Full Bench on appeal, are still applicable. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] ATMO 17">Mr Bebber's interpretation of where Gordon J's words left the question of what is really meant by the term 'good faith' in section 92 , while debatable even in isolation, does not survive the clear observations which had at that time already been made upon the matter by the Full Federal Court, on appeal, in Liquideng Farm Supplies Pty Ltd v Liquid Engineering 2003 Pty Ltd. [10] Mr Bebber did not refer in his submissions, to the words of Justices Tamberlin, Sundberg and Besanko. They began, at para 9: 
 The appeal before her Honour first came on for hearing on 3 May 2007. Her Honour noted that the principal question then presented in those proceedings was whether evidence of a bona fide intention to use a mark for trading purposes was sufficient to demonstrate good faith within the meaning of s 92(4) of the Act, even when the applicant for registration gained knowledge of the mark as an employee of the owner of the unregistered mark, in circumstances tending to suggest a breach of fiduciary duty. Her Honour stated that, having considered the evidence, she would have upheld the appeal on the basis that, contrary to the submissions of the respondent, "good faith" for the purposes of s 92(4) required no more than a genuine intent to use the mark for commercial purposes as opposed to a token use or use for an ulterior purpose, and did not involve any element of honesty or subjective good intention. See Edwards v Liquid Engineering 2003 Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 970 at [8] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] ATMO 21">The judgement in Edwards v Liquid Engineering 2003 Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 970 also dealt with the issue of good faith.

where an application for registration is made by other than the true owner, the Court may rectify the situation by imposing a constructive trust on the application and subsequent registration from the date on which the application was lodged and additionally or alternatively rectify the Register through substitution of the true owner's name. </sentence>
