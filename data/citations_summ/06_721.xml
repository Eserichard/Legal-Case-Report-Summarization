<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1620">10 There are, however, two areas of disagreement: which registry of the Federal Court should manage the proceedings; and, secondly, what the form of those proceedings should be. The first issue, which registry of the Federal Court should manage the proceedings, is, in my view, easily resolved. The applicants' position was that it was a matter for the Court. Macquarie's position was that the proceedings should be managed in the South Australia Registry. There is no doubt that each proceeding or set of proceedings must be considered in terms of its own individual facts and circumstances in deciding which registry of the Federal Court should manage them: see JLV Industries Pty Ltd v MacDonald [2006] FCA 721 at [2] (stating that the standard to apply in deciding whether a case should be transferred to another registry is, bearing in mind the interests of the parties and the ends of justice, where the case can be conducted most suitably). However, in litigation of this nature it is important and in the interests of justice that it is the trial Judge and not another Judge who actively manages the litigation from the outset. </sentence>
