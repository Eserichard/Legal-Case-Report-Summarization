<citances>
<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1242">The applicants' claims initially included alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). In Hine v New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation [2008] FCA 62 Graham J dismissed a notice of motion seeking to strike out the proceeding on the ground of lack of federal jurisdiction. Accordingly, the proceeding remains for determination in this Court despite the fact that the applicants' present claim does not include any federal element. </sentence>
