<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 476">In Worchild v University of Queensland Law Society Inc [2006] FCA 1078 ; (2006) 234 ALR 179 , the applicant brought an action for damages for the amount lost in an adverse costs order in a previous action. His statement of claim alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and Fair Trading Act 1989 (Qld), as well as fraud and negligence. Spender J found that the applicant had no locus standi to bring the action because the essential character of the applicant's claim was that the respondents, through representations, induced him to commence proceedings in the Federal Court in 2004, which led to his losses. The adverse costs order made against him formed the basis of bankruptcy proceedings. As such, the alleged losses could only be pursued through the machinery of the Bankruptcy Act and the various claims could not be severed. (In any event, Spender J found that if the applicant was capable of bringing the proceedings, they should be stayed as an abuse of process). Spender J decided the appropriate order was to dismiss the proceedings as incompetent. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 22">Spender J summarised the cases regarding a bankrupt's competence to commence proceedings in Worchild v University of Queensland Law Society [3] In particular, His Honour referred to Faulkner v Bluett [4] where it was said by Lochart J that "where the essential cause of action is the personal injury done to the person or feelings of the bankrupt the right to sue remains with the bankrupt" but otherwise a right to sue for a direct pecuniary loss vested with the trustee concerned. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] NSWLEC 302">6 Mr Diamond is thus incompetent to bring the principal proceedings: see Worchild v University of Queensland Law Society [2006] FCA 1078 ; (2006) 234 ALR 179 , per Spender J. It follows that the proceedings are a nullity and must be dismissed: see Davies v Kyogle Shire Council [2007] NSWIRComm 9 ; 173 IR 171 , at [18] per Schmidt J, and Rose v Meriton Apartments Pty Limited [2006], NSWIRComm 298 , at [60] per Marks J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 2091">The guiding considerations are oppression and unfairness to the other party to the litigation and concern for the integrity of the system of administration of justice...' 
 
 His Honour set out a non-exhaustive list of matters relevant to the determination whether there was an abuse of process in connection with the issue to be litigated in the second proceedings. These factors were: 
 
 '(a) the importance of the issue in and to the earlier proceedings, including whether it is an evidentiary issue or an ultimate issue;
 (b) the opportunity available and taken to fully litigate the issue;
 (c) the terms and finality of the finding as to the issue;
 (d) the identity between the relevant issues in the two proceedings; 
 (e) any plea of fresh evidence, including the nature and significance of the evidence and the reason why it was not part of the earlier proceedings; all part of ---
 (f) the extent of the oppression and unfairness to the other party if the issue is relitigated and the impact of the relitigation upon the principle of finality of judicial determination and public confidence in the administration of justice; and 
 (g) an overall balancing of justice to the alleged abuser against the matters supportive of abuse of process. ' 

Appl'd : Worchild v University of Queensland Law Society [2006] FCA 1078. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2006] FCA 2009">Further, I understand that subsequent to the decision of Rimmer FM the appellant commenced fresh proceedings in the Federal Court against the Student Law Societies. These proceedings, or the prospect of commencing them, were not raised before her Honour. In any event, the proceedings were recently dismissed by Spender J ( Worchild v University of Queensland Law Society [2006] FCA 1078). </sentence>
