<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 466">The general principles relating to the application of the rule are well-known. They are set out in Reading Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Mutual Provident Society [1999] FCA 718 ; (1999) 217 ALR 495. It is not necessary to recite those principles. Recent case examples in which Reading has been considered and applied include: Australian Equity Investors, An Arizona Limited Partnership v Colliers International (NSW) Pty Limited [2010] FCA 254 ; Permanent Custodians Ltd v Tony Geagea &amp; Ors [2010] NSWSC 117 ; Scantech Ltd v Asbury [2009] FCA 1480 ; SA Water Corporation v United Water International Pty Ltd [2009] SASC 383 ; BW Offshore Ltd v Anzon Australia Limited [2009] FCA 1133 ; Sadiqi v Commonwealth (No 2) [2009] FCA 1117 ; (2009) 181 FCR 1 ; Media Ocean Limited v Optus Mobile Pty Limited (No 5) [2009] FCA 659 ; and Apache Northwest Pty Ltd v Agostini [2009] FCA 534 ; (2009) 177 FCR 449. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] MRTA 443">The agent also points out that where there is any ambiguity regarding interpretation , the Interpretation of Acts 1901, section 15AA is relevant, and cites a recent Federal court case of Apache( Apache Northwest Pty Ltd v Agostini [2009] FCA 534). The agent also points out the actions taken by the visa applicant, and how she had endeavoured to clarify before she made her application with the University and with the Department her situation and was led to believe that she would meet the 15 points criteria for her Honours degree (T f 51). The agent attached copies of the relevant documents to her submission. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] WASCA 231">Although the solicitors for the joint Commonwealth/State inquiry informed the Apache companies that their client did not consider that its consent was required in order to enable the Apache companies to produce the document, they added that, to the extent any release might be necessary, the joint Commonwealth/State inquiry released the Apache companies from their undertaking. See the letter dated 21 May 2009 from the solicitors for the joint Commonwealth/State inquiry. On 22 May 2009, McKerracher J delivered his reasons for decision in Apache Northwest Pty Ltd v Agostini [2009] FCA 534 ; (2009) 256 ALR 56. His Honour held, relevantly, that the disclosure by officers of the State to the joint Commonwealth/State inquiry of documents provided by the Apache companies to the State pursuant to notices issued under s 63 of the Act was not for the purposes of the Act and the Petroleum Pipelines Regulations within the meaning of s 63 of the Act [130] - [131]. Upon McKerracher J delivering his reasons, the Apache companies invited Mr Bills to withdraw the s 63 notice which required production of the 11 May 2009 document.</sentence>
