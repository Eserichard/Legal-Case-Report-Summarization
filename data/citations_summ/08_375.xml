<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 246">The evidence of the above persons concerning the creation of the Seattle and the Memphis was previously considered in detail in Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Carlisle Homes Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 375 (" Carlisle ") and Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1509 ; (2007) 74 IPR 52 (" Metricon "). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 185">If a person independently creates a work that is substantially similar or even identical to another in which copyright subsists, the copyright holder has no recourse: Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd[1999] FCA 138; [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 87 FCR 415 at [86] per Lindgren J. 
 
 69 In the absence of any direct evidence of copying, or access by the respondent to the applicant's work, the causal link can be inferred. The greater the degree of objective similarity, the more likely it will be that that inference will be drawn: SW Hart &amp; Co v Edwards Hot Water Systems (at 472); Clarendon Homes v Henley Arch and Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Carlisle Homes Pty Ltd[2008] FCA 375. 
 
 70 The operative similarity need not be, and indeed rarely will be, to the entire work. However, correspondence to a substantial part of the applicant's design will be sufficient to ground infringement: Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd(2007) [2007] FCA 1509 ; 74 IPR 52.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 31">1 This is an application for leave to appeal from orders made by a judge of this Court on 28 April 2008 (see Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Carlisle Homes Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 375). The primary judge made a declaration that the applicant's Provence house plan and houses built in accordance with that plan infringed the second respondent's copyright in the Seattle 31 house plan and the first respondent's copyright in houses built in accordance with the Seattle plan. The primary judge also granted an injunction against the applicant and he made an order for disclosure by affidavit by the applicant of details of houses built and amounts received and expended by the applicant. He also made other orders, the details of which it is unnecessary to set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 912">69 In the absence of any direct evidence of copying, or access by the respondent to the applicant's work, the causal link can be inferred.

 1 On 20 March 2008 I found in favour of the applicant Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd in its claim for copyright infringement: Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Carlisle Homes Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 375.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FCAFC 46">62 After we had completed these reasons for judgment in draft Heerey J published reasons for judgment in Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Carlisle Homes Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 375. We note that his Honour at [81] expressed his respectful agreement with the conclusion and reasons of the primary judge in this matter on the question of whether the alfresco quadrant was a substantial part of the Seattle and Memphis designs.
