<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 178">Mr Silva notes the following. There has been a bona fide attempt to exercise the power in question. The Minister (through the delegate) honestly believed that the applicant should be notified as the first notification was defective due to the decision in Pomare v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 458. It is immaterial whether the opinion the Minister held was wrong, as it was a bona fide attempt to exercise the power. The decision relates to the subject matter of the legislation. On 13 October 2009, the assistant manager of the Onshore Protection Support Team of the Department issued a letter to the applicant purporting to notify her of the decision made on 5 December 2001, to refuse to grant her an application for a Protection visa (CB 80). This was in effect a re-notification of the primary decision made by a delegate of the Minister issued as a consequence of the decision in Pomare v Minister of Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 458. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] AATA 21">A decision referred to in the decision in SZMTR is that of Pomare v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 458 ; (2008) 167 FCR 494 ( Pomare ). In that case, Lindgren J found a notice that referred only to the Tribunal's post office box as the place where an application for review of a decision could be made, did not comply with the legislative requirement that the notice should state the address (of the registry office or offices) "where the application for review could be made". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] MRTA 1779">In the ultimate, I accept that submission.... The weight of authority clearly supports the conclusion that the provision of the Tribunal's documents setting out details of where the application should be made complied with the requirement contained in s. 66(2)(d) (iv) of the Act to notify the applicant where the application for review can be made. " 
 In Pomare v MIAC [2008] FCA 458 the applicant relied on s501 G(1)(f)(iv) of the Migration Act to invalidate the purported notification sent to him even though the relevant review leaflet had been included with the notification. Not unlike s66(2)(d)(iv) , s 501 G required inter alia disclosure to the applicant of where an application for review could be made. Lindgren J examined the content of the AAT review leaflet and found nothing in it which would have enabled the applicant to know where to lodge his application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 375">Finally, in Pomare v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor [2008] FCA 458 ; (2008) 167 FCR 494 , Lindgren J (at [26]) expressly left the present issue open in relation to s 501(2)(iv) which is in the same terms as s 66(2)(d)(iv). Consequently, the case law referred to by the parties in this matter provides little guidance as to the proper construction of the relevant section.  The first respondent then relied on a number of authorities in which the Court or the Federal Magistrates Court made orders requiring the Tribunal to hear and determine a review application even though the notification of the decision did not comply with the regulation: Pomare v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 458 ; (2008) 167 FCR 494 ; Zhan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 327 ; (2003) 128 FCR 469 ; Patel v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 392 ; (2009) 108 ALD 151 ; MZXGL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2006) FMCA 1724 ; MZXGM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2006) FMCA 1723 ; 204 FLR 480 ; SZKHR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) FMCA 138. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] AATA 270"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCAFC 186">45 A brochure that simply identified the address of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as a GPO box "in the capital city of your State" without stating that the application would not be received by the tribunal until it reached the registry of the tribunal did not comply with a requirement such as that in s 501G(1) of the Act: Pomare v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 458 ; (2008) 167 FCR 494. Lindgren J held that by specifying a post office box, the brochure made it impossible for the person and the tribunal to know when the application for review would reach, or had reached, the post office box and thus it would be uncertain when it was received or made: Pomare 167 FCR at 497-498 [23]-[24]. Lindgren J held that the brochure there did not comply with the requirements of s 501G(1)(c) to (f) to notify an applicant "where the application could be made": Pomare 167 FCR at 499 [31]. Thus, the first respondent argued, the tribunal's use of a post office box address in the brochure did not sufficiently state where or when the application should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 1124">His Honour made a declaration that the MRT had jurisdiction to review the decision and ordered it to do so. [47] Allsop J accepted a submission that the omissions prevented the letter and its enclosed decision record from being characterised as a `notification', or as the fulfilment of the requirement to `notify', for the purposes of ss 66 and 347 (1)(b)(i) of the Migration Act . " 
The applicant also prays in aid the views expressed by Lindgren J in Pomare v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 458. In that case the notice (which was in respect of rights of review to the AAT) said this:
 
 "[17] Under the heading "HOW TO APPLY FOR REVIEW", the following appeared: To apply to the AAT for a review of the decision, you can either: &#8226; Write to the AAT and explain the details of the decision and the reasons you seek a review, or &#8226; Complete an application form obtainable from the AAT that outlines all of the information required. Your application for review must be accompanied by a copy (or the original) of the document notifying you of the decision plus a set of all the documents given to you at the time of notification of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] RRTA 720">The applicant, who claims to be a citizen of China (PRC) arrived in Australia [in] August 1996 and applied to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for a Protection (Class XA) visa [in] February 1997. The delegate decided to refuse to grant the visa [in] August 1997 and purported to notify the applicant of the decision and his review rights by letter [on the same date]. That purported notification was invalid for reason that it was afflicted by the type of error identified by the Federal Court in Chan T a Srey v MIMIA [2003] FCA 1292. The applicant was renotified of the decision and his review rights by letter dated [in] September 2005. That purported notification was also invalid for reason that it was afflicted by the type of error identified by the Court in Pomare v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 458 and he was again renotified of the decision and his review rights by letter dated [in] October 2008. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 139">The first was that the applicants were never notified of the primary decision of 7 August 2007, as required by s.66(1) and 66 (2)(d)(iv) of the Act, because the purported notification did not inform the applicant of where the application for review can be made as is required by the legislation (and as interpreted in Pomare v MIMAC [2008] FCA 458). The ground was based on the contention that the document enclosed with the notification letter advising of the Tribunal's address at which to lodge a review could not properly be considered part of "the document" that complied with legislative requirements. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] AATA 106">At a hearing on 2 April 2008 I gave an oral decision dismissing the application on the ground that it had been lodged out of time and was therefore invalid. The applicant appealed to the Federal Court against that decision and on 14 May 2008 Allsop J by consent remitted the matter to the tribunal in light of the Federal Court's decision in Pomare v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 458 , which turned on the invalidity of the notice of visa cancellation. At the hearing on 2 April, the applicant had not challenged the validity of the notice but had submitted that he had been under the mistaken impression that he had 28 days, rather than nine days, in which to apply to this tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FCA 1627">6 The applicant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision on 11 February 2008. However as the application was made outside of the nine day time limit prescribed by s 500(6B) of the Act the Tribunal dismissed the application on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. Subsequently, as a result of this Court's decision in Pomare v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 458 , the applicant was renotified of the decision to cancel the visa on 8 May 2008. The applicant then reapplied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision on 14 May 2008. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] AATA 873">Subsequently, this matter was identified as having been affected by the Federal Court of Australia decision in Pomare v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 458 , in which it was held that a notice of visa cancellation, giving this tribunal's address for service as its post office box number rather than its street address, was invalid under s 501G(1) of the Act. Consequently, this application was remitted to the tribunal for reconsideration. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] AATA 835">On 19 December 2007, this tribunal decided that it had no jurisdiction to hear the applicant because it was lodged outside the statutory nine-day time limit. On 9 April 2008, however, Lindgren J of the Federal Court held that as the notice did not comply with s 501G(1)(f)(iv) of the Act, the nine-day time limit had not commenced to run and the application was therefore not out of time ( Pomare v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2008] FCA 458). The validity of the notice had not been challenged at the initial jurisdiction hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2008] AATA 668"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] AATA 420">However, he was of the view that s 500(6H) and (6J) would nevertheless continue to constrain the Tribunal because the hearing of this matter had commenced. Mr Brown referred to Goldie v the Minister for Immigration [2001] FCA 1318 ; (2001) 111 FCR 378. He also referred me to the case Pomare v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 458 , a decision of Lindgren J. In Pomare's case, Lindgren J held that time to lodge an application to the Tribunal had not commenced to run because the applicant had not been properly notified of the Minister's decision. However, it was not argued that Mr Baskin had not been properly notified.</sentence>
