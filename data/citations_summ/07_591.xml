<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 305">In Fisher v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 ; (2007) 162 FCR 299 , Stone J considered s.477A of the Act which is concerned with imposing time limits on the bringing of proceedings in the Federal Court in relation to migration decisions and is, relevantly, identical to s.477. Although her Honour was considering ss.477 and 477A as they stood prior to the amendments made by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No.1) 2009 , in both the earlier and later versions of those provisions the courts' discretion to extend time has been conditional on the court in question being satisfied that an extension of time would be in the interests of the administration of justice. In relation to this Court, her Honour observed: The latter requirement would involve consideration not only of the reasons for not meeting the original time limit but also whether the application, were the extension of time to be granted, would have any prospect of success. An assessment of the prospects of success would require the FMCA to consider at some level the merits of the application for judicial review ... (at 307 [35]) </sentence>

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 1104">I have dealt with the foregoing matters in a little detail to dispel any impression which might otherwise be generated that the appellants had been dealt with harshly and in an overly technical manner. However, the obstacle which faces them in their appeal to this Court is even more substantial. Section 476A(3) of the Act prohibits an appeal to this Court from a judgment of the FMCA refusing to extend time under s 477 of the Act. It is competent for the Parliament to limit the jurisdiction of this Court in that way (see SZICV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 39 ; (2007) 158 FCR 260 ; Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 ; (2007) 162 FCR 299 ; SZAJB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 75 ; [2008] FCAFC 75 ; (2008) 168 FCR 410 ; Keo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 676 ; (2009) 177 FCR 479). The discussion in the cases referred to concerned the terms of s 477 of the Act in an earlier form but the principle applied yields the same conclusion in the present case. The jurisdiction of this Court has been effectively excluded if, as occurred in the present case, an application for judicial review is dismissed because it is brought out of time and no extension of time is granted by the FMCA. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 634">In Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCA 591 , Stone J suggested (at [35]) that the concept "... in the interests of the administration of justice " in s.477(2)(b) "...would involve consideration not only of the reasons for not meeting the original time limit but also whether the application, were the extension of time to be granted, would have any prospect of success ".

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 879">Before 15 March 2009, s 477 of the Act imposed strict time limits on applications to the FMCA for judicial review of decisions of the RRT. Such an application was required to be made within 28 days of the actual notification of a decision of the RRT or (if an extension to this effect was granted) within a further 56 days. If a relevant application had not been made within the 84 days allowed by s 477 in total, relief against a decision such as that made by the RRT on 11 November 2008 was statute barred ( SZICV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 39 ; (2007) 158 FCR 260 ; Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 ; [2007] FCA 591 ; (2007) 162 FCR 299 ; SZAJB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 75 ; (2008) 168 FCR 410 ; Keo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 676 ; (2009) 177 FCR 479). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCAfam 440">Subsequently, in Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) FCA 591 , Stone J in the Federal Court considered what was meant by the expression "pending" or "pending proceedings" as it appears in s.39 of the Federal Magistrates Act . In that decision her Honour said this: 22 The respondent points out that s 39 requires that there be a proceeding 'pending' in the FMCA for the power of transfer to this Court to arise and submits that a proceeding cannot be 'pending' in a court that does not have jurisdiction in respect of it. This submission fails to take into account that while the Federal Magistrate did not have jurisdiction to review the Tribunal's decision, his Honour did have limited jurisdiction in respect of the proceeding.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 1627">22 In considering whether it is 'in the interests of the administration of justice' to grant an extension of time to file an Application for Judicial Review, the Court is guided by the observations of Stone J in Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCA 591 ; (2007) 162 FCR 299. In such decision at [35] her Honour said:
 The latter requirement [whether an extension of time is in the interests of the administration of justice] would involve consideration not only of the reasons for not meeting the original time limit but also whether the application, were the extension of time to be granted, would have any prospect of success. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FMCA 1476">Alternatively, the defendant may have recourse to judicial review by a superior court, challenging the right of an inferior court to adjudicate the plaintiff's claim and seeking orders to prevent the inferior court continuing to hear the claim. However, the invocation of jurisdiction ordinarily enlivens the authority of the court in question at least in the first instance to decide whether it has jurisdiction. (at 371 [15] and [16] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ) 
See also Fisher v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 per Stone J at [13]. These considerations apply to the NSWIRC proceedings which Mr Primmer and the CFMEW(NSW) brought against Fine Line. Consequently, I find that the NSWIRC proceedings were a "proceeding under an industrial law" for the purposes of s.793(1)(k).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] WASCA 189">24 In Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 ; (2007) 162 FCR 299 Stone J considered s 39 of the Federal Magistrates Act which authorised the Federal Magistrates Court to transfer a proceeding pending in that court to the Federal Court or the Family Court and referred to the Macquarie Dictionary which gives the meaning of 'pending' as including 'remaining undecided, awaiting decision'. This was held to be an appropriate description of the proceeding as it was until the federal magistrate made an order disposing of it. In this case, bearing in mind s 38(2) which deals with a circumstance where the matter is 'part heard', the word 'pending' therefore means 'remaining undecided but not heard'.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCAFC 75">33 Counsel for SZAJB acknowledged that the finding by this Court that s 477 is invalid or should be read down would involve departing from previous decisions of the Federal Court: 
 
1. SZICV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 39 ; (2007) 158 FCR 260 (decided before Bodruddaza [2007] HCA 14 ; 228 CLR 651). 2. Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 ; (2007) 95 ALD 66 at [39] - [43]. 3. SZJYV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 731. It was noted that in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKKC [2007] FCAFC 105 ; (2007) 159 FCR 565 the validity of the section was assumed and was apparently not put in issue by the parties. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2007] FMCA 1945">On any analysis of the situation and on any conceivable evidentiary basis, therefore, in my opinion the applicant has no arguable case for establishing jurisdiction in relation to the relief sought in this matter. Whether relief might be available from either the Federal Court or the High Court, is not something I need to decide. I also note that I was not asked to transfer the matter to the Federal Court on the basis that it had a broader jurisdiction than this Court (cf. Fisher v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 591). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2007] FMCA 1841">[15] For the purposes of these proceedings the Applicant and Respondent did not dispute that these proceedings and the Federal Court appeal are "in respect of an associated matter" for the purposes of s.19(1) of the FM Act . As the matter was argued on that basis before this Court the contrary view was not put, but the contrary view, namely that an appeal in respect of a bankruptcy notice and fresh proceedings in respect to the issuance of a creditor's petition are not in respect of an associated matter, may be correct: see BGC Construction Pty Ltd v Genovese [2007] FMCA 1842. As to when proceedings are "pending" see generally Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 (" Fisher "); Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd (2007) 207 FLR 141 ; [2007] FMCA 71 (" Genovese 2007 "); Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 923 , dismissing an appeal from Genovese 2007 .

<sentence id="cs14" from="[2007] FMCA 1825">12. The applicant's interlocutory application sought to avoid the anticipated objection, by inviting a transfer of the matter to the Federal Court to avoid any doubt in relation to jurisdiction. On current authority, a transfer can be made effectively, even where this Court itself lacks jurisdiction (see Fisher v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 591). However, as I have indicated above, the argument developed by the respondent challenges the jurisdiction of any eligible court to entertain the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2007] FMCA 1628">In Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 , Stone J considered the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court to transfer a matter over which it has no jurisdiction to the Federal Court of Australia.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2007] FMCA 1062">However, in my opinion, Buchanan J's opinion is binding upon me in the present situation, and is consistent with previously expressed opinions in that Court (see also Stone J in Fisher v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 at [39] , and Downes J in SZJYV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 731 at [5] ).</sentence>

<sentence id="cs19" from="[2007] FCA 731">5 I note that in the recent decision of Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA 14 , the High Court declared s 486A of the Migration Act invalid. Section 486A purports to impose time limits on the High Court's jurisdiction to entertain applications for review in much the same way as s 477 applies to the Federal Magistrates Court. The High Court declared s 486A invalid on the basis that it impermissibly limits the right of applicants to seek relief, in the form of constitutional writs, under s 75(v) of the Constitution . In my opinion, this decision does not bring the validity of s 477 into doubt. The Federal Magistrates Court obtains its jurisdiction from statute rather than the Constitution . If the legislature wishes to confine that jurisdiction it is entitled to do so (see SZICV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 39 at [45] - [47] and Fisher v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 591 at [43] ).</sentence>
