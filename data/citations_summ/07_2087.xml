<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 794">54 The respondent submits that on this point the decision in Pedikaris v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [No 2] [2007] FCA 2087 should be followed. Particular reliance is placed on para [99]. I do not agree. At that paragraph, Graham J was considering the relevance of PAYG payments in the context of recovery proceedings. Furthermore, his Honour, at paras [92]-[93], made findings on the issue of when the Commissioner was obliged to give credits for PAYG payments which are entirely consistent with the concurrent findings of Siopis J and the Full Court to which I have referred.
