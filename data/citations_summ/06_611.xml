<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 1331">19. In all, on the material that is before the Court, the information relied on by the Tribunal was either information provided by the applicant himself for the purposes of the review, information that was the subject of a letter pursuant to s.424A(1) of the Act, or information in the nature of independent country information which falls within the exception contained in s.424A(3)(a) of the Act from the requirements of s.424A(1) and (2) of the Act. But I note, as submitted by Mr Mitchell, that in any event, with reference to SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 611 (at [16]), that to the extent that any findings of the Tribunal were based on the applicant's answers to questions asked at the hearing, those answers were given by the applicant for the purposes of the application to the Tribunal, notwithstanding that the questions may have been informed by material that did not form part of that application.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 827">
 

21 There is no evidence that the Tribunal provided any notification to the appellant, in advance of the hearing date, that the statutory declaration would be relied upon. Further, the Tribunal was not invited by the appellant by a written communication before or at the hearing to consider the information in his declaration which would have activated the exemption: see M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 , SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034 and SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 611 , nor did the appellant bring the statutory declaration to the hearing. These facts suggest that the statutory declaration was not regarded by the appellant as being significant in his application before the Tribunal. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 754">SZEEU (at [91], [173] and [264]) held that information does not cease to be information given for the purpose of the application for review, even if it can also be derived from an alternative source. To the extent, therefore, that the Tribunal relies on what it says is information in the protection visa application, and that this "differs significantly from what was said at the hearing", this information, having been provided by the applicant subsequently (republished) for the purposes of the review, is brought within the exception contained in s.424A(3)(b) of the Act . (See also SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034 at [6] , SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 611 , and SZEPI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1645). 37. Given the situation as set out immediately above, it is not necessary to consider the Minister's second basis for asserting that there is no breach of s.424A of the Act in relation to this information.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 671">19 Barnes FM was correct to find that the appellant had republished to the Tribunal the information which he had provided to the Department in his protection visa application. Accordingly, although the information provided to the Department falls within the meaning of information for the purposes of s 424A(1) , the Tribunal was entitled to rely on such information concerning the appellant's activities in the church due to the exception provided by s 424A(3)(b) of the Act: see SZHIB v Minister or Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 611 at [8] ; NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2005] FCA 744 at [36] - [37]; SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 at [20] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 792">14 Furthermore, the Federal Magistrate found that there was republication of the appellant's claims, made in his protection visa application, in the statements of the appellant at hearing and in the pre-hearing submission. This meant that s 424A(3)(b) applied and there was no obligation on the Tribunal to comply with the procedures stipulated in s 424A(1): see SZHIB v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 611 at [23] .

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 705">In SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 611 Young J at [8] referred to a letter that accompanied the appellant's application for review to the Tribunal in which the appellant stated amongst other things that he did not think that the First Respondent's delegate had considered all of his claims fairly and carefully and had repeatedly in that letter referred to the claims which his Honour found must be read as a reference to detailed claims set out in an earlier statutory declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 116">20 The Minister submits that the information provided by the appellant in his Protection visa application including that relating to his claims concerning the establishment of bible study groups, the black list and his alleged detention was republished to the Tribunal. Such information was provided by him to the Tribunal in his statutory declaration dated 20 December 2004 for the purposes of review. Accordingly the Minister submits that the information falls within the exception in s 424A(3)(b) of the Act and relies upon the decision in SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034 at [6] ; SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 611 at [23] .  33 The Tribunal could not have properly reviewed the Minister's decision pursuant to the invitation to review the appellant's claims without having regard to the claims in the Protection visa application. In this way, the appellant re-published those claims. The same considerations referred to by Gyles J in NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 and by Young J in SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 611 apply. The information contained in the Protection visa application was given by the appellant to the Tribunal as provided in s 424A(3)(b) of the Act by virtue of the re-publication. It follows that there is no breach of s 424A(1) of the Act. 9 The Tribunal's decision refers to the appellant's claims that he was a key member of an underground church and had successfully set up three bible study groups; that he was detained for almost two weeks in April 2004. The information relating to these matters was not contained in the Application for Review nor in the declaration provided by the appellant to the Tribunal. However Raphael FM considered s 424A of the Act and held that these claims had nevertheless been republished by the appellant for the purposes of his application for review to the Tribunal. Raphael FM stated at [13]:
 
 'All three of these claims are made originally in the protection visa application, but in his application to the Tribunal, the applicant squarely put all these matters in issue by saying that he did not think the delegate had considered all his claims fairly three times at [CB55], [CB56] and [CB59]. Ms Wong rightly points out that this type of submission by an applicant to the Tribunal which refers directly to the matters considered by the delegate are matters which fall within the exception stated in s.424A(3)(b) of the Act: SZDNG [sic] v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 1034 at [6] ; SZHIB v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 611 at [23] . ' </sentence>

 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2007] FMCA 200">All such information was therefore given by the applicant to the Tribunal for the purposes of the application, and fell within the exception stated in s.424A (3)(b) of the Act : SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration [2005] FCA 1034 ; SZHIB v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 611.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2007] FCA 368">10 The other aspect of this ground of appeal is that the Tribunal relied upon information which related to the circumstances under which the appellant left China. The Tribunal did observe that the appellant left China legally and on a passport issued in his own name. The Tribunal thought it unlikely in all the circumstances that the Chinese authorities would have permitted the appellant to depart on his own passport if in fact they were seeking to persecute him as he alleged in his protection visa application. The appellant seems to contend in this ground of appeal that the fact the he left the country on his own passport and in his own name was information of the kind that ought to have been given to him in the way required by s 424A(1) of the Act. However, it is established in judgments of this court to which the Federal Magistrate referred, namely, M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 at [25] and SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 611 , that where information originating in the details provided by an applicant for the purposes of his protection visa application is effectively republished in the applicant's application for review in the Tribunal, it falls within the exclusion set out in s 424A(3)(b). That is to say, it is proper to treat such information thereafter as information given by the applicant for the purposes of the application. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2007] FMCA 46">What the applicant said in the letter to the Tribunal was similar to the content of a letter to the Tribunal considered by Young J in SZHIB v MIMA [2006] FCA 611 at [8] .</sentence>

The submission was that this was not a "mere adoption" of the earlier statement in the course of a hearing before the Tribunal ( SZEEU at [20]). When viewed objectively the import of what the applicant put in his application for review was that he wanted the Tribunal to consider the whole of his earlier statement as an account of his claims (see SZGGT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [50] , and also SZHIB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 611 at [23] ). 11.

<sentence id="cs13" from="[2006] FMCA 1725">In the case before me, the applicant was not subject to any questioning, or cross-examination, by the Tribunal, but provided this statement, adopting the contents of his earlier statement, by way of a statutory declaration made by him, and sent to the Tribunal by his migration adviser. 21. Mr. Kennett referred the Court to Young J. in SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 611 , on appeal from this Court, a Judgement that was given post SZEEU . In that case the source of the statement adopting the earlier statements made to the Minister's Department was contained in a letter accompanying the application for review.
