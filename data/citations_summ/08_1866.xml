<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 877">The Applicant appealed. On 10 th December 2008 Middleton J upheld the appeal ( SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [13] . ) The orders of the Court were: 1. The appeal be allowed. 2. The matter be remitted to a differently constituted Federal Magistrates Court for a re-hearing and reconsideration only of the issue of bias taking into account any admissible evidence of Mrs Peterson adduced by the appellant. 3. There be no order as to costs  It was submitted that there is no reason why the Court cannot have regard to the views expressed by Smith FM in SZITH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [59] on the issue of apprehended bias and no reason why the First Respondent cannot adopt those views. Middleton J explicitly expressed no view as to the correctness of Smith FM's conclusions ( SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [60] at [73]). Whilst Smith FM's decision carries no precedential value as it has been set aside but the First Respondent considers those views to be correct and adopts and relies upon them by way of submission. [61] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 471">There are a large number of authorities to support the above. (See SZMMP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 per Lander J at [63], and also SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 per Cowdroy J, SZMAE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 per Edmonds J, SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1866 per Middleton J, SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 per Gilmour J and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 per Jaggot J, cited in SZMMP at [63] and in SZMCD at [98]. See also SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [99] . ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 46">98 At [63] of his Honour's reasons, his Honour noted that his Honour's decision was consistent with decisions of other judges of this Court in SZLXI [2008] FCA 1270 (Cowdroy J), SZMAE [2008] FCA 1701 (Edmonds J), SZITH 105 ALD 541 , [2008] FCA 1866 (Middleton J), SZLWI [2008] FCA 1330 ; 171 FCR 134 (Gilmour J) and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 (Jagot J). 48 Counsel for the first respondent submitted that the only consequence of non-compliance with the specific requirements of s 424AA is that the Tribunal does not get the benefit of the provisions of s 424A(2A). It was submitted on behalf of the first respondent that this interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions was supported by five cases in this Court, namely: SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] ; SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 103 ALD 589 , [2008] FCA 1270 at [27] ; and SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 ; (2008) 171 FCR 134 at [19] ; SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 at [23]; and SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 105 ALD 541 , [2008] FCA 1866 at [56] ---[60]. Each of those cases was decided by a single judge sitting on appeal from a Federal Magistrate. The decisions contain the views of five judges of this Court. Each authority is recent. They constitute a consistent body of recent authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 233">The applicant's contention as to the construction in s 424AA has been considered and rejected by other members of the Court in SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1270 (Cowdroy J), SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 (Edmonds J), SZITH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1866 ; (2008) 105 ALD 541 (Middleton J), SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 (Gilmour J) and SZLML v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 83 (Jagot J). Although the reasons in those cases may not be as these reasons, I agree in the results. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 224">Mr Cleary of counsel who appeared for the Minister submitted that the grounds in the amended application did not disclose jurisdictional error. In particular he submitted that a failure to comply with s.424AA of the Act does not constitute jurisdictional error and referred the Court to the Full Court appellate decision of SZLWI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [7] particularly at [19] where his Honour Gilmour J referred to the operation of s.424AA and spoke with approval of the decision of this Court in SZMCD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [8] at [56] and other paragraphs. I was also referred to the decisions of SZLML v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [9] , SZMAE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [10] and SZITH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [11] on that same point. Further, it was submitted that even though there was no obligation, nor can there be, to comply with s.424AA of the Migration Act , the Tribunal did in fact do so as appears from the decision record. </sentence>
