<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWSC 344">450 I also admitted in reply (over objection by Mr Lever) the evidence of Mr and Mrs Taranto (other neighbours in Cessnock for whom Mr Makeig has provided services), to the effect that no such statement had been made to them, again because of the similarity of the situation involving local developments and assistance to neighbours in roughly the same time frame. I did so conscious of the observation expressed by Branson J in Bective Station Pty Limited v AWB (Australia) Limited [2006] FCA 1596 to the effect that evidence of a negative (ie that statements were not said on a particular occasion) could not assist in determining the positive (ie whether on the occasion in question the alleged statements were made), but on the basis that I considered there might be sufficient probative weight in this case where, the evidence relied upon by Mr Batterham was a similarly isolated instance. (There is also, as I apprehend it, some further relevance in that Mr Taranto in his affidavit squarely contradicts matters asserted by Mr Batterham in his affidavit. )</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1922">9 The applicant submitted that the evidence has significant probative value in determining whether the representations as recounted by Mr Setter were made having regard to the following factors: - (i) "significant probative value" is less than "substantial probative value" but the evidence must be "important" or "of consequence" (citing R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 , (ii) "striking similarity" or "underlying unity" are indicative of potential probative value but are not essential, (iii) the evidence in this case is from five feedlot farmers concerning representations made within a few days of each other and having a marked similarity to the representations in issue, (iv) Mr Adams not only denies the central representation (that if the applicant did not buy wheat now, in late October or early November 2002, there would be none left until the next harvest and the applicant could not get grain for the feedlot until October 2003) but says the statements attributed to him were ridiculous and would not have been so understood, (v) each of the deponents gives evidence of Mr Adams saying that grain could or would run out before the next harvest (October 2003), (vi) Branson J had determined that the evidence was admissible under s 97 in Bective Station Pty Limited v AWB (Australia) Limited [2006] FCA 1596 having regard to the very similar representation in [5] and the factors specified in [83] (namely, the closeness in time of the conversations, the similarity of language, the reference in each that the supply of wheat could or would run out, and the nature of Mr Adams' denial), and (vii) if the evidence has significant probative value then (and contrary to the respondent's submissions) the evidence would not be excluded under s 135(c) of the Evidence Act (which provides that the court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might cause or result in undue waste of time). </sentence>
