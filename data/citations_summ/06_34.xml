<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 38"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1827">10 The respondent, which vigorously prosecuted a cross-claim for revocation of Black &amp; Decker's patents and design, can hardly complain that the present proceeding was commenced in a "prescribed court", being the only court in which a revocation proceeding could be brought: Patents Act s 138 ; see LED Builders Pty Ltd v Hope [1994] FCA 1353 ; (1994) 53 FCR 10 at [17] ; Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1371 ; (2004) 64 IPR 57 at [8] - [9] ; Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788 at [203] ; Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 844 at [6] ; Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 34 ; (2006) 227 ALR 287 at [32] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 98">He said nothing about the situation in which there was such a judgment in combination with other relief, much less about the situation that faces us here, namely, where damages, declarations and injunctions were sought, but where the only final relief awarded to the appellant is by way of a money judgment. That r 36A does have application in cases of this kind was at least implicit in the reasons of the trial Judge in the case reported on appeal as O'Kelly Holdings Pty Ltd v Dalrymple (1993) 45 FCR 145 , 154 and in the refusal of the majority (Sweeney and O'Connor JJ) to interfere with the trial Judge's discretion in relevant respects (see 45 FCR at 157). That proposition was affirmatively held by Moore J in Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Pashalidis [2000] FCA 1815 , and has been held, or assumed, by single Judges of the court since: see eg Sony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Stirling [2001] FCA 1852 ; Reidy's Lures Pty Ltd v Basser Millyard Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1242 ; Australasian Performing Right Association Limited v Metro On George Pty Limited [2004] FCA 1371 ; Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2006] FCA 487 ; and Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 34 ; (2006) 227 ALR 287. In the circumstances, we propose to proceed on the basis that r 36A does apply here. We do so because the submission made on behalf of the appellant is directly contradicted by Pashalidis , an authority not referred to by counsel, which has generally set the pattern of subsequent single-Judge decisions on the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 878">12 The damages sought by the applicant in this proceeding were far from modest. They amounted to $1,380,000. This was not a case which, had the applicant's principal submissions been accepted, it was likely that the best that could be hoped for by way of damages would have been less than $100,000. Moreover, the issues were complex as evidenced by the engagement, on both sides, of senior counsel and the length of the submissions made on behalf of both parties: cf Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 34 ; (2006) 227 ALR 287 at 293. These considerations warrant, in my view, a departure from the general rule.</sentence>
