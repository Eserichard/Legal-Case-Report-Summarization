<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 810">There is an additional case, not included in Table A involving the CFMEU, McDonald and Buchan where there was conduct in breach of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) which, the applicant submits, can be seen as in the nature of industrial action and relevant to the question of penalty. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 1730 , Nicholson J penalised the CFMEU $50,000 in respect of two incidents at the Holiday Inn site, next to Burswood Casino. The incidents took place on 16 April 2004 and 4 November 2004. McDonald and Buchan were involved in a secondary boycott, preventing and hindering the supply of concrete to the site, both directly and through organising a picket line which acted as a physical barrier to prevent entry of concrete trucks and the concrete pump. McDonald engaged in this conduct on both dates. Buchan was engaged, in concert with McDonald, in the unlawful conduct on 16 April 2004, but not on 4 November 2004. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 695">49 Having regard to the reasoning of Nicholson J in Australia Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 1730 at [6] , the declarations sought are appropriate because they:
 
(a) are an appropriate vehicle to record the Court's disapproval of the contravening conduct;
 
(b) serve to vindicate the applicant's claim that the respondent contravened the CCA and ACL; 
 
(c) are of some assistance to the applicant in the future in carrying out the duties which are conferred upon it by the CCA and ACL; 
 
(d) may inform consumers of the dangers arising from the respondent's contravening conduct; and 
 
(e) may deter others from contravening the CCA and ACL.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 375">Finally, I consider that the declarations are appropriate: Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organics Inc (No 2) [1993] FCA 83 ; (1993) 41 FCR 89 at 100 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 329 at [21] --- [22]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v LG Electronics Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1118 at [8] --- [9] and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 1730 ; (2007) ATPR 42-140 at [6] . They are an appropriate vehicle to record the Court's disapproval of the contravening conduct. They may deter other corporations from contravening the CCA. There is, however, in the circumstances of this case, a further reason for granting the declarations. In the absence of them, the contravening conduct would not otherwise be clearly identified and there is at least some public benefit in that contravening conduct being clearly identified. INJUNCTIONS

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FCA 372">Finally, I consider that the declarations are appropriate: Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organics Inc (No 2) [1993] FCA 83 ; (1993) 41 FCR 89 at 100 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 329 at [21] --- [22]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v LG Electronics Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1118 at [8] --- [9] and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 1730 ; (2007) ATPR 42-140 at [6] .

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1382">In A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Limited , Gyles J expressed perhaps a more expansive view as to the potential relevance of other unlawful conduct. Referring to a great many previous decisions, His Honour thus concluded: 
 
 [13] A number of findings involving unlawful behaviour by officials related to the CFMEU have been made in recent years, in addition to the other case involving Lane (eg Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 , (1999) 94 1R 231; Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Hamberger [2003] FCAFC 38 ; (2003) 127 FCR 309 ; Alfred v Walter Construction Group Ltd [2005] FCA 497 ; Martino v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union , Magistrates Court of Victoria (Industrial Division), 10 May 2006; Alfred v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union , District Court of New South Wales, 3 March 2004; Hadgkiss v Blevin [2004] FCA 697; [2004] FCA 917 ; Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 524 ; (2007) 162 IR 385 ; Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 1730 ; (2007) ATPR 42-140 ; Cruse v Multiplex Ltd [2007] FCA 2015 ; Cruse v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FMCA 1873 ; and Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 1001 ; (2007) 167 IR 320). Counsel for the CFMEU submits that only building industry cases are relevant, and then only those that involve the relevant divisional branch (the New South Wales Construction and General Divisional Branch), bearing in mind that the Union is an amalgamated federation ( Re Election for Office in the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ; Ex parte Sutton [2002] FCA 971 ; (2002) 115 IR 345 at [23] ). I agree that the classes of case identified are the most relevant, but I do not agree that the other cases are irrelevant.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FCA 141">There is, in my view, a more fundamental reason why the Court should not grant the relief sought --- the claims failed. During the course of argument, Counsel for the Applicant could not refer me to any authority or principle which would support the making of a declaration in circumstances where the claims had failed. After the hearing, the Applicant referred me to the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Tobacco Institute of Australia Limited v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) [1993] FCA 83 ; (1993) 41 FCR 89 at 99-100 as authority for the proposition that the Court has power to make a declaration in a case brought by a member of the public provided that the person had an arguable case for an injunction notwithstanding that the member of the public had suffered no damage and the case was not one appropriate for injunctive relief. In Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Kokos International Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 5 at [48] , French J summarised the cases in the following terms: 
There may be a question about their utility given that these reasons set out the findings of fact and the contraventions which underpin the injunctive relief which has been granted and the pecuniary penalties which are to be imposed. However, as Nicholson J pointed out in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 1730 ; (2007) ATPR 42-140 at [6] such declarations: 
 
 Are an appropriate vehicle to record the Court's disapproval of the contravening conduct: Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc [1993] FCA 83 ; (1993) 41 FCR 89 at 100; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chen [2003] FCA 897 ; (2003) 132 FCR 309 at [36] .

In Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v CFMEU [2006] FCA 1730 ; [2007] ATPR 42-140 all four of the present respondents were found to have engaged in secondary boycott action by preventing or hindering the supply of concrete to a site by forming a picket line at the gate. Both Mr McDonald and Mr Powell have had their rights of entry revoked or suspended because of their conduct in connection with the exercise of such rights. The applicant asserts that the CFMEU has, on numerous occasions, been found to have contravened other provisions of industrial legislation involving coercive behaviour and false and misleading statements, advising or organising action with intent to coerce an employer and breaching orders.</sentence>

I agree that the classes of case identified are the most relevant, but I do not agree that the other cases are irrelevant. Ultimately, union officials will act in accordance with the policies of the union. An official of one geographic or industry branch will observe the manner in which policies are applied by the federal body in relation to other branches. These various cases illustrate that the federal body has not been effective in ensuring that officials act in accordance with the law. I note that there is no evidence of offending officials (including Lane) suffering any serious disciplinary penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FCA 5">48 Save for the orders sought against Mr Chad Kim in relation to the alleged attempted contravention of the Code, the declaratory orders sought are within the power of the Court to make.

However, as Nicholson J pointed out in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 1730 ; (2007) ATPR 42-140 at [6] such declarations: 
 
 1.

<sentence id="cs15" from="[2007] FCA 11">76 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] FCA 1730 , two unions were involved in conduct on two separate occasions, in April 2004 and again in November 2004, in contravention of s 45D of the TPA. The April conduct interrupted a concrete pour for several hours and it was followed by a picket which obstructed access to a construction site for a new hotel at the Burswood Casino in Perth. The interruption of a concrete pour and the picket caused significant delays to the project and exposed the builder to losses. The November conduct was another picket at the site which restricted access by construction workers. Each of the unions agreed to pay a pecuniary penalty to the Commonwealth of $50,000. Nicholson J concluded that the proposed penalties were appropriate. In doing so, his Honour made particular reference to the fact that the unions had co-operated with the ACCC by approaching the Court for the final disposition of the proceeding on a non-contested basis, and that neither union had engaged in the conduct for financial gain: at [14].</sentence>
