<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 142">4 Upon leaving his employment as a result of incapacity, Mr Wood received compensation payments from ASP. In October 2003, ASP refused Mr Wood's application for an increase in his incapacity payments due to what he said was an increase in normal weekly earnings under s 13(6) of the Act. Mr Wood's application under s 78 of the Act for review of that refusal was dismissed, and the Tribunal concluded that he should not receive an increase under s 13(6). On appeal to this court, the primary judge concluded that the Tribunal's decision was in error (see Wood v ASP Ship Management Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 459). His Honour held at [33] that the Tribunal misdirected itself by treating the remuneration received by Mr Wood as an employee in the 'blue water' segment on the one hand and caterers engaged in the 'offshore segment' on the other hand as paramount to the determination of which class Mr Wood fell into for the purposes of s 13(6).
