<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 942">(2) The Drawings are marked "ISSUED FOR PRODUCTION" and are dated 22 September 1997. They bear the description Drawing No 4930/01 Issue A, and the client is described as Goldspar Pty Ltd. 
 (3) The City of Sydney (the "City") was a party to proceedings in the Federal Court that involved Goldspar Pty Ltd. Included were the following proceedings: (a) [2002] FCA 1064 ; (b) [2002] FCA 1268 ; (c) [2004] FCA 568 ; and (d) [2006] FCA 472. (4) Mr Newman and Mr Matchett gave evidence in the Goldspar litigation: see for example [2004] FCA 568 at [75] . Professor Green also gave evidence in that litigation: [2004] FCA 568 at [141] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 28">Mrs Evans submitted that conduct is relevant to the consideration of whether any agreement existed: see Country Securities Pty Limited v Challenger Group Holdings Pty Limited &amp; Anor [2008] NSWCA 193 at [162] . Mrs Evans submitted that such conduct might also be relevant to the establishment of the existence of an implied term and refers to the observation of Gyles J in Council of the City of Sydney v Goldspar Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 002 705 991) and Another [2006] FCA 472 ; (2006) 230 ALR 437 at [164] in which his Honour said: 
 
 I can see no difficulty in regarding subsequent conduct as relevant to the question as to whether a term is necessary to give business efficacy to the contract. 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] VSCA 247">[29] But in this case, the possibility of such an implied term is excluded by the express inconsistent provisions of cll 2.2(e), 3.2(e) and 4.20.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] NSWSC 710">168 The second aspect of this alleged implied term is the implied duty to act in good faith. The variety of opinions in both the authorities and commentaries in relation to the implication of a duty of good faith in commercial contracts has been described as "bewildering": Council of the City of Sydney v Goldspar Australia Pty Limited [2006] FCA 472 ; (2006) 230 ALR 437 at 498 par [166]. Unfortunately, Chapter 2 "Good Faith", of the most recent edition of Contract Law in Australia, 5th Ed, Lexis Nexis Butterworths, Australia (2007), now co-authored by JW Carter, Elisabeth Peden and GJ Tolhurst, exacerbates the situation. The authors have declared that [2-01]:
 
 
 
 Good faith is inherent in all common law contract principles, and any attempt to imply an independent term requiring good faith is unnecessary and a retrograde step. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 1066">134 It is sufficient to note that intermediate courts have repeatedly been willing to hold that such a duty exists. However, as noted earlier I was referred to only one decision where the existence of such a duty (express or implied) was held to have been breached: Pacific Brands Sport &amp; Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 288 at [66] , a decision which Gyles J subsequently described as ' adventurous ': Council of the City of Sydney v Goldspar Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 472 ; (2006) 230 ALR 437 at [166] . Two things should be noted about the decision at first instance. First, the breach of such a duty was not determinative ( Pacific Brands Sport &amp; Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 288 at [60] ) and the decision was the subject of appeal. Finn and Sundberg JJ at [119] considered that it was unnecessary or inappropriate to deal with the issue given their conclusions on other issues and, further, went on to say (at [119]) that:
 
 
 "Given both the multiple assumptions required to be made if one was to consider [the subject of breach of an implied duty of good faith] and the potentially contentious nature character of it in any event, we do not consider it is appropriate or helpful to enter upon the matter at this point in this appeal. "
