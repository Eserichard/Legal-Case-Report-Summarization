<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] NSWSC 508">78 The fifth decision is that of Finn J in Gryst v Dromana Estate Ltd, re Dromana Estate Ltd [2008] FCA 1148. There, the time for compliance with a Statutory Demand expired some six months before the creditor filed an application to wind up founded upon the presumption of insolvency under s 459C92)(a). His Honour held that the creditor could not rely upon the presumption because the application had not been made "during the three months ending on the day when the application was filed" , relying upon that part of the judgment in Pinn which relates to "staleness" in a Statutory Demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] NSWSC 509">
 
 




6 In Gryst v Dromana Estate Ltd [2008] FCA 1148 , Finn J considered circumstances in which no application to set aside the statutory demand had been filed within the relevant 21 day period.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] NSWSC 1089">12 This is a case in which the winding up application is entirely devoid of prospects of success. Summary dismissal is warranted: see Gryst v Dromana Estate Ltd [2008] FCA 1148. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 1499">1 In Gryst v Dromana [2008] FCA 1148 I ordered that an application under s 459P of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to wind up Dromana be summarily dismissed under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1975 (Cth). The issue now before me is that of costs.</sentence>
