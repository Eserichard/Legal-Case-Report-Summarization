<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 230">In 2007, in Lamb v Hog's Breath Company Pty Ltd (No. 3) [2007] FCA 972 , French J made directions in the course of copyright proceedings, granting the applicant general leave to administer interrogatories directed to particular matters about which the applicant said it lacked clear information. Those matters were described as the particular functions of the respondent companies as members of the Hog's Breath Group of Companies in Australia; the respective roles of those companies in the use of particular works described in the statement of claim; and the ways in which the relevant works and the particular registered trade marks had been used by the respondents. Notwithstanding the scope of leave, the applicant filed and served, beyond the time limited by the order, a notice said to contain 90 separate questions. Consideration of his Honour's reasons suggests that the questions administered by the applicant went well beyond what was contemplated by the order for general leave. It also seems to me from the tenor of his Honour's reasons that his Honour thought the interests of justice were not advanced by granting general leave to administer interrogatories. </sentence>
