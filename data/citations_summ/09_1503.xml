<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1093">While TRS cannot proceed on the case as presently pleaded it should be given the opportunity to yet again seek leave to reformulate its statement of claim. This is because s 31A "is not activated by mere deficiencies in the pleadings": Butorac v WIN Corporation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1503 , [19]; see also Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 195 , [59]. If TRS does seek and is granted leave to deliver a further amended statement of claim (a matter which must be of some doubt at this stage of the litigation game), it may be able to show a claim that should be allowed to go to trial. </sentence>
