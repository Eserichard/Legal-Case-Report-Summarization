<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 166">I do not agree with the submission made on behalf of the applicant as to the meaning of left Australia for the purposes of s 34(2)(c) of the Act. In my view, there was no warrant for the imposition of a cumulative requirement that the particular person whose movements are under consideration be absent for a period in excess of 30 days. It seems to me that the only requirement is that they go outside the territorial limits of Australia. This was the view expressed by Ryan J in Moran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 242 ; (2006) 151 FCR 1 at [30] and I see no reason not to follow his Honour. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] HCA 50">In reply, the Minister argued that attempting to distinguish Jia Legeng and Gunner from the present case by pointing to the fact that both powers were available does not assist Mr Nystrom, as was recognised by Ryan J in the recent case of Moran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [162] . Ryan J declined to follow that reasoning, saying that an extensive line of authority, including Jia Legeng and Gunner , bound him to hold that "s 501 is an independent parallel source of power to cancel a visa which is not impliedly cut down by the presence in the Act of ss 200 and 201" [163] .</sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2006] HCATrans 197">A case indistinguishable from the present case on the facts was Moran v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 242 decided by Justice Ryan very recently and this very argument, this very attempt to distinguish these cases was put to Justice Ryan and he rejected it, particularly at paragraphs 139 to 144.</sentence>
