<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 113">An action has a 'significant impact' if the impact is ' important, notable, or of consequence having regard to its context or intensity ': see Booth v Bosworth [2001] FCA 1453 ; (2001) 117 LGERA 168 at [99] . As was stated by Marshall J in Brown v Forestry Tasmania and Others (No 4) [2006] FCA 1729 ; [2006] FCA 1729 ; (2006) 157 FCR 1 at [300] , the EPBC Act requires a construction ' which views protection of the environment as an act of not merely keeping threatened species alive, but actually restoring their populations so that they cease to be threatened '. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 540">Regard to s 16 discloses that it, too, has a "significant impact" element akin to that found in s 12, but in this instance focused upon the ecological character of a declared RAMSAR wetland. For reasons already given in respect of Booth [2001] FCA 1453 ; 114 FCR 39 , "significant impact" has no role to play here in relation to the alleged breach of the condition and hence a contravention of s 142. (c) Brown v Forestry Tasmania (No 4) [2006] FCA 1729 ; (2006) 157 FCR 1. In this case, the alleged contravention grounding injunctive relief was a contravention of s 18 of the Act. Regard to that section discloses that it, too, has a "significant impact" element, on this occasion related to listed threatened species included in the "extinct in the wild" category.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] AATA 1876">There will be circumstances (e.g. Brown v Forestry Commission (No 4) [2006] FCA 1729) in which two causes independently give rise to detriment where only one potential detriment falls within the s 303FN tests. In such a case it will be no answer to the relevant detriment that there is also an irrelevant detriment. However, that is not the case here. The additional measures proposed by the Conservation Council are accepted by them to lead to satisfaction that there is no detriment. However, we find that they will give rise to no measurable change. The complementary proposition seems to be that the present operation is not independently detrimental. Moreover, we are not here dealing with independent causes at all. This is because the real risk comes from the already depleted population together with the biology of grey nurse sharks. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1480">43 The applicant supports the assertion that the impact of actions should be assessed in the context of the impact of other potential actions by referring to Booth v Bosworth [2001] FCA 1453 ; (2001) 114 FCR 39 , Minister for Environment and Heritage v Greentree [2004] FCA 741 ; (2004) 138 FCR 198 , Greentree v Minister for Environment and Heritage [2005] FCAFC 128 ; (2005) 144 FCR 388 , and Brown v Forestry Tasmania and Others (No 4) [2006] FCA 1729 ; (2006) 157 FCR 1. In my view none of these cases supports the applicant's argument.</sentence>
