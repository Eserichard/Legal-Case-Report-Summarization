<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 248">&#8226; VQAB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 104 at [25] and [31] where a failure to make a finding regarding a passport did not amount to jurisdictional error because there had been no claim before the Court that being refused a passport amounted to persecution. The refusal of the passport was "merely a piece of evidence to bolster the claim of persecution". &#8226; He also relied an MZWKU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 996 (" MZWKU ") where Sundberg J. found that a failure to have translated certain letters submitted by the applicant in that case did not amount to jurisdictional error because the letters, in that case, did not contain any matters that were not otherwise before the Tribunal, which in any event had considered those matters. His Honour found at [15] that the letters were "mere items of evidence, and not either the ground upon which the appellant sought protection or an essential integer of that ground". Mr. Johnson emphasised that His Honour found (also further at [15]) that although the Tribunal was "thus not bound to take them into account", it "did so".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 66">The consequence of the approach the Tribunal adopted was that it ignored relevant material. ' 
 
 O'Loughlin J, who dissented in the result, characterised the conduct of the Tribunal as 'the refusal ... to have regard to the contents of the diary (and this, effectively, means the refusal ... to arrange for an interpretation of the contents of the diary)': at [41]. These passages in the reasoning in X 116 FCR were considered and distinguished by Sundberg J in MZWKU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 996. In distinguishing X 116 FCR, his Honour said at [19]: 
 
 'In the present case the Tribunal did not refuse to take the letters into account. The appellant accurately explained their content, as appears at [11], and the Tribunal took that into account in the manner there appearing.</sentence>
