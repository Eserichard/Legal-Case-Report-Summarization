<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 1240">A judicial determination concludes not merely the point actually decided but also a matter which it was necessary to decide and which was actually decided as the ground work for the decision itself, though not directly the point in issue. Matters cardinal to a later claim or contention cannot be raised if to raise them would necessarily involve an assertion that the judicial determination previously made was erroneous (per Dixon J, as his Honour then was, in Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 532; see generally per Graham J in J F Keir Pty Limited v Sparks [2008] FCA 611 at [55] - [61]).

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 1080">I do not intend in these reasons to elaborate all the principles relating to res judicata, issue estoppel and Anshun estoppel that may arise. I would refer to my consideration of those matters in JF Keir Pty Ltd v Sparks [2008] FCA 611 at [55] and following, and also to the decision of the High Court in Ramsay v Pigram [1968] HCA 34 ; (1968) 118 CLR 271.

It is clear that, despite the bar being lowered, the Court should approach the question of summary dismissal with considerable caution. For all the reasons expressed in these authorities, as I apprehend it, the lowering of the bar or relaxing of the standard was intended only to give a power which the Court may exercise in the more obvious instances. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 1529">45 Despite the fact that there is some difference of opinion in the Court as to the precise test to be applied and as to whether a decision under s 31A is final or interlocutory, it is clear from the discussion in Boston Commercial and Jefferson Ford that it is for the judge to decide whether there are reasonable prospects of success. In doing so, the judge conducts an inquiry into the merits of the question in order to decide whether it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial ( Jefferson Ford at [23] per Finkelstein J, at [74] per Rares J; Bond v Barry [2008] FCAFC 115 at [72] per curiam). That test and the matters to be considered in coming to a conclusion are not mandated by the legislature. That is the case whether or not it is mandatory ( Jefferson Ford at [128]---[129] per Gordon J) or discretionary ( J F Keir v Sparks [2008] FCA 611 at [12] per Graham J) to give summary judgment once that assessment is made or whether the discretion is a general one ( Boston Commercial at [45] per Rares J) or limited by the circumstances of "no reasonable prospect of success" ( Jefferson Ford at [129] per Gordon J). The Court is still in the position of determining the facts and inferences to be drawn in deciding whether or not the test in s 31A has been satisfied in any given case. It is for the Court to decide whether the basis for summary judgment has been established ( Gypsy Jokers at [7] per Gleeson CJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2008] FMCA 1363">The outcome of the present proceedings does not depend on the creditor asserting a right or claim inconsistent with any earlier finding by Riethmuller FM. The creditor does not seek to raise any matters cardinal to the later creditor's petition which would necessarily involve any assertion that the judicial determination of Riethmuller FM was erroneous. I note in that respect that as Dixon J stated in Blair v Curran at 532 --- 533 (and see J F Keir Pty Limited v Sparks [2008] FCA 611 at [58] ): " Findings, however deliberate and formal, which concern only evidentiary facts and not ultimate facts forming the very title to rights give rise to no preclusion. Decisions upon matters of law which amount to no more than steps in a process of reasoning tending to establish or support the proposition upon which the rights depend do not estop the parties if the same matters of law arise in subsequent litigation . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2008] FCA 1470">6 There is a divergence in the authorities about the nature of the power to dismiss proceedings on the ground that they have no reasonable prospects of success. On one view it is a power conditional on the finding of the relevant facts without any element of discretion (for example, Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd (2008) 167 FCR 372 ; [2008] FCAFC 60 at [128] --- [129]). On another it is a discretionary power that may or may not be exercised if the facts enlivening its exercise are found (for example, JF Keir Pty Ltd v Sparks [2008] FCA 611 at [12] ). This difference could be relevant to the nature of the appellate function because of the restrictions on appellate review of discretionary decisions ( House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505). In this case, however, the divergence is immaterial because the trial judge's decision to dismiss the proceedings summarily was based on the construction of the statutory provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FCA 1461">
 

24 Although there has been debate about whether the word "may" in s 31A(2) vests in the Court a power conditional on certain facts being found or discretion (see, for example, Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd (2008) 167 FCR 372 ; [2008] FCAFC 60 at [127] --- [128] and JF Keir Pty Ltd v Sparks [2008] FCA 611 at [12] ), certain aspects of the operation of the provision are clear. First, s 31A(3) , in terms, discloses that s 31A(2) involves a less stringent test than that applicable at common law for summary dismissal. Secondly, and as Rares J observed in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; [2006] FCA 1352 at [46] , " s 31A regulates the attainment of justice by creating an entitlement in a party to be protected from claims or defences which fail to meet the threshold prescribed in the section". Thirdly, and again as Rares J said in Boston Commercial Services at [45], "in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s 31A , the court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing the proceedings where... contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed. As soon as the evidence may have such an ambivalent character prior to a final determination, I am of opinion that then, as a matter of law, at that point there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s 31A. Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, the moving party will not have discharged its onus to enliven the discretion to authorise a summary termination of the proceedings which s 31A envisages". This is consistent with the statement by Tamberlin J in Paramasivam v University of New South Wales [2007] FCA 875 at [14] that "... it is essential that the Court must be careful not to do an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings, or denying an applicant an opportunity to ventilate their case ...". Fourthly, and as Lindgren J noted in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 160 FCR 298 ; [2007] FCA 511 at [50] , s 31A "is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form".</sentence>

<sentence id="cs14" from="[2008] FCAFC 115">73 Gordon J at [128]-[131] was of a different view. She said that the existence of a real issue of law does not necessarily preclude summary judgment because the Court can usually hear and determine a disputed point of law expeditiously, without the need for a trial. Graham J has expressed his disagreement with this: J F Keir Pty Limited v Sparks [2008] FCA 611 at [12] and [52]. </sentence>
