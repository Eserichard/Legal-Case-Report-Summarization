<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1445">Secondly, the primary judge referred to s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) which she said: "... p rovides the Court with a general discretion to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be, inter alia , unfairly prejudicial to a party ": see [2008] FCA 378 at [13] . Then, her Honour appears to have made an assessment of the probative value of the fourth affidavit. In the process, she observed that it contained: " vague references (for example, with respect to use of the trademarks in paras 10 and 11 ...), possible inaccuracies (for example, in para 16 ...), opinion evidence (for example, para 17 ...) ... ": see at [13]. Finally, on this aspect, her Honour stated that she accepted that Television would suffer " unfair prejudice " if Channel were to be allowed to rely on the fourth affidavit: see [2008] FCA 378 at [13] .  The next step is to consider the reasons the primary judge gave for rejecting the fourth affidavit. First, in the "findings" section of her Honour's reasons for that decision, the primary judge began by stating " In my view the fourth and fifth affidavits are not admissible ": see [2008] FCA 378 at [11] .  Thirdly and finally, her Honour noted the obligation a court has to allow a party " the opportunity to raise an arguable case in accordance with the principles in Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 " (" JL Holdings "), and, by comparison, noted that it would be unfair to Television to require it to deal, on the run, with new evidence produced at the last minute: see [2008] FCA 378 at [15] . I would interpolate that, given her Honour's ultimate conclusion, it is to be inferred she considered the unfairness caused to Television outweighed the prejudice caused to Channel.  Secondly, the primary judge referred to s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) which she said: "... p rovides the Court with a general discretion to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be, inter alia , unfairly prejudicial to a party ": see [2008] FCA 378 at [13] . Then, her Honour appears to have made an assessment of the probative value of the fourth affidavit. In the process, she observed that it contained: " vague references (for example, with respect to use of the trademarks in paras 10 and 11 ...), possible inaccuracies (for example, in para 16 ...), opinion evidence (for example, para 17 ...) ... ": see at [13]. Finally, on this aspect, her Honour stated that she accepted that Television would suffer " unfair prejudice " if Channel were to be allowed to rely on the fourth affidavit: see [2008] FCA 378 at [13] .  The primary judge refused to give Channel leave to rely upon the fourth (or the fifth) affidavit and published reasons for that ruling (see [2008] FCA 378). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 271">The respondent contended that there was no proper evidence before the Court that there was any owner prior to the respondent of the opposed trade mark. Further, the respondent submits that the only evidence before the Court that the trade mark applicant was The Food Channel Pty Ltd was exhibit 5A and exhibit 6A, which should not have been allowed into evidence, and the fourth affidavit of Mr Lawrence sworn 16 March 2008 which was excluded as evidence by my judgment of 18 March 2008 ( Television Food Network, GP v Food Channel Network Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 378). </sentence>
