<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 700">By contrast I do not think that that s 120(2)(b) is engaged. It is true, as Solahart submits, that Solar Hut's solar roof panels are necessarily installed by skilled tradesmen so that it may be said that SOLARHUT has been used in relation to 'services', in particular, the services of those tradesmen. But the question is whether those services 'are closely related' to Solahart's solar hot water heaters. I do not see how the installation of those panels can be 'closely related to' solar hot water heaters: cf.

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCAFC 184">21 The appellants conceded that, if backpacks and handbags were not goods of the same kind, then the respondent's predecessor Edgarlodge made first use of the mark "Colorado" in respect of handbags. A further issue of proprietorship arose, however, in relation to wallets and purses. The parties approached this question on the basis that purses and wallets were goods of the same kind. On this basis, the primary judge stated his view that purses and wallets were goods of the same kind as handbags. The appellants contested this on their appeal. His Honour reached this conclusion because he considered that handbags and purses were "intended as fashion items and are used to carry small, everyday items such as money, credit cards, keys and like objects": see Colorado Group Ltd Strandbags Group Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 880 ; (2006) 69 IPR 281 at [31] . Allsop J states the contrary view, observing that handbags often have a wider purpose than purses and wallets. There is something to be said for both points of view. Indeed, the difference of opinion highlights that the matter is essentially one of impression about which reasonable minds might well differ. </sentence>
