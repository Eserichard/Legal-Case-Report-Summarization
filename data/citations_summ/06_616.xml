<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 374">The respondent argues that: the phrase "ordinary time rate of pay", when used in an award or other industrial instrument or industrial/employment legislation, means the base rate of pay fixed in the Award for the employee concerned, multiplied by the 38 ordinary hours fixed under the Award , and says that that proposition is effectively unarguable; [9] the Mechanical Engineering Services (No.2) case is for all intents and purposes, on all fours, with the present circumstances, and that: clause 4.4.1(e) of the Metal, Engineering and Associated Industries Award 1998 is word-for-word identical to clause 12.1.5 of the Award ; and this Court is for all intents and purposes, obliged to follow Mechanical Engineering Services (No. 2) ; [10] it does not matter what the normal or standard hours worked by Mr Stewart or Ms DiIulio were (whether 84, 42 or something less), nor does it matter what their actual rate of pay under the Employment Agreements was; the claim arises under the Award , and that as such, Mr Stewart and Ms DiIulio were each entitled to four weeks' pay at their respective levels, being: level 6 for Mr Stewart; and level 7 for Ms DiIulio, the above entitlement gives rise to a redundancy payment of: $2,711.12 for Mr Stewart; and $2,797.92 for Ms DiIulio. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 29">20 If cl 7.6 of the Woolworths Agreement operates to incorporate by reference into the Woolworths Agreement the relevant provisions of the IR Act , the Court has jurisdiction to interpret those provisions as provisions of the Woolworths Agreement, pursuant to s 849 of the WR Act. Compare Shop Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Woolworths Ltd [2006] FCA 616 (2006) 151 FCR 513 at [24] . In the present case, there is some ambiguity in the words "shall be as described" in cl 7.6 of the Woolworths Agreement. If those words are taken to mean that the provisions of the IR Act from time to time relating to long service leave are incorporated by reference into the Woolworths Agreement, there is no difficulty. If cl 7.6 were to be construed as manifesting an intention that the Woolworths Agreement (with its statutory force) was not to cover the field of long service leave, so that the IR Act simply continued to operate in relation to that subject-matter, then the interpretation of the provisions of the IR Act would be a matter involving State law. This latter view would not mean that the jurisdiction of the Court was ousted altogether. A controversy about the proper construction of cl 7.6 of the Woolworths Agreement would give rise to a matter within the jurisdiction of the Court. The controversy that is the subject of that matter includes the proper construction of the provisions of the IR Act . Accordingly, the Court would have jurisdiction to deal with all aspects of the matter, including the proper construction of the provisions of the IR Act . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 441">Extensive submissions were made by Counsel for both parties as to the rationale upon which the relevant provisions of the State Act applied in this case. However notwithstanding the different routes taken by each party, the destination was the same. In identifying the terms and conditions of employment of relevant employees as regulated by the PSA, and in particular in relation to long service leave, Ch 2 Pt 3 --- including s 43 and s 46 --- apply. A similar conclusion was drawn by Gray ACJ in Shop Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Woolworths Ltd [2006] FCA 616 ; [2006] 151 FCR 513 in relation to the incorporation of equivalent Victorian legislation into the agreement the subject of that dispute. I do not consider it necessary to dwell further on the issue of application of Ch 2 Pt 3 of the State Act in these circumstances --- the necessity for the Court to interpret the relevant provisions of Ch 2 Pt 3 in relation to the operation of the PSA and the application of these provisions in determining the entitlement of relevant employees to long service leave are common ground. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 2084">The Union pointed to the differences between clause 2(c) and 2(d). Whilst it is a generally accepted principle of interpretation that where different terms are used a different meaning is intended the inconsistent use of terminology in an agreement of this nature is not determinative of the matter. [47]  The Union submitted that the meaning given to 'retrenchment' in clause 2(c) should not be used if a contrary intention is indicated. [48] 
The Union submitted that clause 10 evinces a contrary intention and: "...if it is apparent, as it is here, that the parties had a certain intention about the benefits to be provided to employees, then that evidence will be sufficient to indicate a contrary intention. " [49] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 1072">As His Honour noted in Quest at paragraph 26 of his decision, the distinction between Kezich and Catlow appeared: 
 
 
 "...to rest upon the proposition that the fixing by collective means of standard hours of work, coupled with a provision for remuneration at a higher rate of hours worked beyond those standard hours, will usually lead to the conclusion that the standard hours fixed are to be considered as " normal hours " or, perhaps, " ordinary hours ". " 
 
 
 51. Finally, the most recent case to which the Court was referred was Shop Distribution and Allied Employees Association v Woolworths [2006] FCA 616 wherein Gray ACJ considered the meaning of 'ordinary time rate of pay' in a collective agreement under the WR Act . 52. His Honour noted that in Scott the High Court at [7]-[8] made clear that where the expression 'ordinary time rate of pay' is used in relation to conditions of work fixed by an industrial instrument it is a reference to the rate of pay for the fixed standard hours as opposed to overtime or usual or customary time. In s.69(1)(a)(ii) , ordinary time" means the fixed standard hours as opposed to overtime or usual or customary time . " 
 16. This view was most recently upheld by ACJ Gray in the Federal Court in Shop Distributive &amp; Allied Employees Association v Woolworths Ltd [2006] FCA 616 @ 36 where it was stated "... the High Court made it clear that, where the expression "ordinary rate of pay" is used in relation to conditions of work fixed by an industrial award or collective agreement, it is a reference to the rate of pay for the "fixed standard hours as opposed to overtime or usual or customary time. " 
 17. In CFMEU &amp; Anor v John Holland Engineering Pty Ltd PR968157 30 January 2006 @ 22, Commissioner Harrison said " Despite the fact the Agreement provides for systematic and regular overtime, these hours are over and above ordinary time and should not be included in any calculation for payment in lieu of notice .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] AIRC 132"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2006] AIRC 647">This is the approach to be taken even if there are inconsistencies of expression "&#8230;which might tend to some other reading". (Kucks). The issue of inconsistency of expression was recently considered in SDAEA v Woolworths Limited 2006 FCA 616 (25 May 2006) per Gray ACJ (at paragraph 26) who noted that consistency will often be absent in the terminology in certified agreements (and the ASU submits, awards). 
 
 29. However, in the instant matter, there is no inconsistency or infelicity of expression.</sentence>
