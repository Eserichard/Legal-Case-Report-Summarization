<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 4">2 For the purposes of an application under subsection 411(1) of the Act, the compromise or arrangement proposed must be between a " Part 5.1 body" and its members or any class of them or its creditors or any class of them. A Part 5.1 body is defined in section 9 of the Act in terms that include a company registered under the Act. The Certificate of Registration confirms that as a company incorporated under the Corporations Law of Victoria, AXA APH has this status. It is well established that a scheme designed to effect an acquisition by one company of the shares in another, such as the Share Scheme, may be an "arrangement" under subsection 411(1). [1] It is also well established, that in the absence of opposition, holders of options to take up shares in a company are considered a class of contingent creditors of the company. [2] Therefore, the Rights Scheme, which cancels rights to acquire shares upon payment of cash consideration, is also a proposed "arrangement" under the Act. 
 
  30 On this basis, I accept the plaintiff's submissions that: 
 
 (a) the exclusivity period of 7.5 months (in practical terms, likely to be less than five months) is within the range of reasonable period for acquisition schemes; [28] 
 
(b) there is, as required in accordance with subsequent authorities, a carve-out of the no-talk and no due diligence provision in relation to the director's fiduciary duties --- see clause 9.2(c) of the Framework Deed; and
 
(c) the exclusivity period has been adequately disclosed in the explanatory statement to go to the minority shareholders --- see pp 232 and 233 of the Explanatory Memorandum
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSC 423">21 First, the exclusivity period is for a specified period of just less than 5 months. [8] Such a period is within the period of restriction that the courts have accepted as reasonable. [9] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] VSC 367">The consistent approach of Courts in later cases has been to require a fiduciary carve out only in relation to "no talk" provisions. [12] 
20 It is sufficient for present purposes to note that the exclusivity period is for five months which is within the period of restriction that the Courts have accepted as reasonable. [13] 
21 I also note that the "no talk" provisions are subject to an exception recognising the directors' statutory and fiduciary duties. 22 The "No shop" and "Notice of Competing Proposal" provisions are not subject to the same exception. However, I am satisfied that these provisions are not inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1472">On 28 October 2009 I ordered pursuant to s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) that there be convened: 
(a) a meeting of all holders of fully paid ordinary shares of the plaintiff (Sino Gold) (excluding Eldorado Gold Corporation (Eldorado) or any of its subsidiaries or any person who held shares on behalf of or for the benefit of Eldorado or any of its subsidiaries) for the purpose of their considering and, if thought fit, agreeing, with or without modification, to a scheme of arrangement between them and Sino Gold (the Share Scheme); and
 
(b) a meeting of each of two classes of holders of options for the purpose of their considering and, if thought fit, agreeing, with or without modification, to a scheme of arrangement between the optionholders and Sino Gold (the Option Scheme): see Sino Gold Mining Limited, in the matter of Sino Gold Mining Limited [2009] FCA 1277. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] VSC 560">21 I am satisfied that those criteria are met: 
 
 (a) the exclusivity period of little under five months is within the range accepted in other cases; [29] 
 
(b) there is a carve out in relation to directors' fiduciary duties contained in cl.10.2 of the Implementation Agreement; and
 
(c) the exclusivity period is disclosed in the explanatory memorandum to go to shareholders in s.8.6(d) of the Scheme Booklet.</sentence>
