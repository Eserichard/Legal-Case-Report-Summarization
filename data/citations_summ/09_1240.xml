<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 457">Counsel for Mr Brown submitted generally that this complaint demonstrated a case that was compellingly weak and hence that it was all the more reasonable, fair, just and convenient that the liability case against Mr Brown be heard separately from the lengthier and more involved claim Ms Wylie brought against McCanns, albeit if there was to be a question of damages that could be dealt with at the time it would arise in the normal course of the main hearing. Counsel for Mr Brown also submitted that the risk of an appeal from any determination of separate questions, should be given little weight in the balancing exercise in the circumstances of this case, given that there was always such a risk and if that was to be a significant impediment it would mean that the provision in the Rules for determination of separate questions would have almost no utility. Counsel for McCanns acknowledged that the test was that there should be seen to be a " clear advantage" in granting an application for a separate determination of questions in the interests of justice ( Pascoe v Boensch [2009] FCA 1240 at [1] ) and supported the submissions of Mr Brown. It was submitted that this case was unusual in that while a number of matters were alleged against McCanns under the SDA arising out of an employment contract, attached to that case was what was said to be a quite separate claim about the so-called Paul Brown Conduct which, however, had significant ramifications in terms of the court's time and the parties' costs. It was submitted that (subject to the result of the strike-out application) if this matter was not dealt with separately McCanns' case would necessarily involve preparation of at least significant submissions and possibly also evidence in relation to the allegations of agency given the allegations by Ms Wylie that McCanns was liable on principles of agency for the Paul Brown Conduct.</sentence>
