<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 605">The applicant submitted that he should not have to pay any part of Merck's costs, since Merck was jointly represented with MSDA, and it is a fair inference that, generally speaking, only one set of costs was incurred. Here the applicant relied upon Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage and Distribution Pty Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 1592. In that case, there were five respondents, four of whom were part of a single corporate group and had common representation. The fifth respondent proposed that it should be obliged to pay only such fraction of the costs of the partly successful applicant as was calculated by reference to the number of respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 156">2 The appellant, Vawdrey Australia Pty Ltd which was the second trailer manufacturer, appeals against the findings of the primary judge in relation to copyright infringement, the quantum of damages and the costs in Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage &amp; Distribution Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 803 (30 May 2008, liability judgment), in Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage &amp; Distribution Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 1493 (9 October 2008, quantum judgment) and in Krueger Transport Equipment Pty Ltd v Glen Cameron Storage &amp; Distribution Pty Ltd (No 3) [2008] FCA 1592 (28 October 2008, costs judgment). The three judgments reflect the primary judge's three staged approach to the proceedings. There was a hearing on liability, a hearing on damages, and written submissions on costs and reasons for judgment published at each stage.
