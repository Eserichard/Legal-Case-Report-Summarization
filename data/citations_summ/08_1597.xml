<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] NSWCA 96">128 The disposition of the Supreme Court proceedings also had the potential to affect the parties' interests in the Rehab shares. The primary relief sought in those proceedings was the appointment of a Receiver and Manager of the Property, alternatively the appointment of a provisional liquidator. The proceedings were brought pursuant to s 232 of the Corporations Law. In addition to the orders Mr Kitas sought, the Court also had a discretion, if satisfied one of the grounds in s 232 was established, to make an order for the purchase of any shares by any member: s 233(1)(d) Corporations Law. In deciding whether to make such an order, the Court would no doubt take into consideration the restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Rehab Shareholder's Deed, although such a restriction could not bind the exercise of the discretionary power. The presence of such a restrictive provision could be relevant to the valuation of the shares for the purpose of determining the price to be paid for the court-ordered transfer: see Rambaldi; in the matter of Philip Charles Weeden, a bankrupt v Weeden [2008] FCA 1597 (at [39] --- [46]) per Heerey J.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1975">5 In those circumstances, two issues arise on the present application. The first is whether it was open to Mr Pascoe to rely upon the provisions of s 1072C of the Act. I have been taken this afternoon to a number of authorities which deal with the effect of that section. The decision of Campbell J in the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Buffier (2005) ACSR 839 seems to me plainly to support the applicability of s 1072C to authorise Mr Pascoe to pass the resolution. Other authorities to the same effect include the decision of Sackville J in Prentice v Cummins [2002] FCA 1165 at [7] ; the decision of Hasluck J in Nilant v RL &amp; KW Nominees Pty Ltd [2007] WASC 105 ; and the decision of Heerey J in Rambaldi; in the matter of Weeden, a bankrupt v Weeden [2008] FCA 1597 at [40] . </sentence>
