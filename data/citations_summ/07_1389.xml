<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1187">I am otherwise satisfied, for the reasons referred to in Mr Oakes's written opening submissions, which I will mark MFI1, that all of the necessary evidence is before me in accordance with the approach taken by Gyles J in Re Orion Telecommunications Limited [2007] FCA 1389 at [5] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] NSWSC 1104">


 
23 For reasons explained in earlier cases, it is premature for the court to seek to come to any conclusion on that matter at this stage: Re Orion Telecommunications Ltd [2007] FCA 1389 ; Re Macquarie Private Capital A Ltd [2008] NSWSC 323 ; (2008) 26 ACLC 366 ; Re Macquarie Capital Alliance Ltd [2008] NSWSC 745 ; (2008) 67 ACSR 484 ; compare Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd [2007] QSC 37 ; (2007) 61 ASR 266. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] VSC 423">10 Clause 4.5 of the Mitchell Scheme provides that each Scheme Participant warrants to Aegis that their Scheme Shares are free from encumbrances. The view consistently taken by courts in recent times is that a deemed warranty clause is unobjectionable as the purpose and effect of the deemed warranty clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. [2] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] VSC 367">The particular provisions are: 
 
 (i) A deemed warranty provision 
 
 12 The proposed scheme provides for a deemed warranty from the Healthscope shareholders that their shares are free from encumbrances. The view consistently taken by Courts in recent times is that a deemed warranty clause is unobjectionable as the purpose and effect of a deemed warranty clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. [8] In the circumstances, and consistently with the preponderance of authority, I do not regard the warranty clause as posing any issue in relation to the Court exercising its power to convene the meeting. 13 I am also satisfied that there is adequate disclosure of this provision in the explanatory booklet. [9] 
(ii) Exclusivity Provisions 
14 Healthscope has agreed to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit or accept alternative proposals for a certain period.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 10">The evidence presented by the plaintiff in support of its application was comprehensive. I am satisfied that the elements needed to be proved in a first court hearing in relation to a scheme under the Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act , as accepted by Gyles J in Orion Telecommunications Limited, in the matter of Orion Telecommunications Limited [2007] FCA 1389 at [5] have been established by that evidence. In particular the evidence established that ASIC had had a reasonable opportunity to examine the proposed scheme and explanatory statement and was given the requisite notice of the proposed date of the first court hearing. The fact that the plaintiff and Orion have entered into the Merger Implementation Agreement indicates that the Scheme is bona fide and has been properly proposed. The factual information in the Scheme booklet has been verified on behalf of the plaintiff and, where relevant, on behalf of Orion. Proper arrangements have been proposed for the conduct of the meeting including Mr Munns' consent to act as chairman and Mr Yue's agreement to be the alternate chairman. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] VSC 560">[30] I note that the deemed warranty clause is disclosed in s.8.2 of the Scheme Booklet and I accept the submission that it is no obstacle to the Court ordering the convening of a meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] NSWSC 745">49 No issue was raised as to whether evidence should be adduced on the question whether the Australian members' scheme was proposed for the purpose of avoiding the operation of Chapter 6, although there is in fact some evidence on that subject in Mr Moss's affidavit. On that subject, I respectfully agree with the observations of Barrett J in Macquarie Private Capital A Ltd [2008] NSWSC 323 , at [24]ff, and the observations of Gyles J in Orion Telecommunications Ltd [2007] FCA 1389 at [5] (cf Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd [2007] QSC 37 ; (2007) 61 ACSR 266).

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] VSC 154">[12] 
 
 Deemed warranty 
 
(10) Clause 8.6 of the Share Scheme states that:
 
Each Scheme Participant is deemed to have warranted to [Incitec US Holdings] that all of their Scheme Shares (including any rights and entitlements attaching to those shares) will, at the date of the transfer of them to [Incitec US Holdings], be fully paid and free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise, and restrictions on transfer of any kind, and that they have full power and capacity to sell and to transfer their Scheme Shares together with any rights and entitlements attaching to such shares. (11) This type of clause was strongly criticised by Fryberg J in Mincom No 1 [13] as being:
 
onerous, unreasonable and calculated to catapult unsuspecting shareholders who have not read the small print of the arrangement in the schedule to the explanatory statement into a statement of breach of warranty. (12) However, the subsequent line of authorities, including APN, Adelaide Bank, [14] Re Orion Telecommunications Ltd [15] , Coles Group No 1 [16] and Re Hostworks Group Ltd, [17] consider such clauses to be acceptable as long as the warranty is sufficiently disclosed in the explanatory statement to shareholders. (13) Having regard to the disclosure made in section 1.11 of the draft Scheme Booklet, we submit that this deemed warranty clause is acceptable. Performance Risk 
 
(14) Some recent court cases have raised the issue of 'performance risk' --- ie, the danger that the bidding company may be, or may become, unwilling or unable to meet its obligations to pay the cash consideration component to the transferor shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] NSWSC 323">25 That approach is somewhat at odds with the approaches that had been taken to that point. These were generally as outlined by Gyles J in Orion Telecommunications Limited [2007] FCA 1389 at [5] :
 

 
 
 "Counsel has correctly summarised what needs to be proved as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) The plaintiff is a ' Part 5.1 body'. (b) The proposed scheme is an 'arrangement' within the meaning of s 411. (c) There has been proper disclosure to members. (d) The scheme is bona fide and properly proposed. (e) The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has had reasonable opportunity to examine the proposed scheme and explanatory statement, to make submissions and has had 14 days' notice of the proposed hearing date of the first court hearing --- see generally s 411(2). (f) Any other procedural requirements have been met, eg r 3.2 as to nomination of chairperson for scheme meeting. "  I share the understanding of his Honour that the purpose and effect of such a clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. The amount of the damages payable for breach of the warranty would be equal to the amount required to discharge the encumbrance. I note that the approach of Lindgren J has been preferred in subsequent cases, including by Robson J in Re Coles Group Ltd [2007] VSC 389 at [45] ; by Lander J in Re Adelaide Bank Ltd [2007] FCA 1582 at [33] ; and by Gyles J in Orion Telecommunications Ltd [2007] FCA 1389 at [9] . " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCA 64">41 Under cl 7.3(a) of the Implementation Agreement, each scheme participant is deemed to have warranted that all of its shares in Hostworks which are transferred under the scheme will be free from all mortgages and encumbrances. Fryberg J in Re Mincom Ltd (No 3) (2007) 25 ACLC 207 , regarded an almost identical deemed warranty clause as onerous and unreasonable and "calculated to catapult unsuspecting shareholders who have not read the small print of the arrangement in the schedule to the explanatory statement into a state of breach of warranty": at [21]. In Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; 62 ACSR 400 , Lindgren J disagreed with the approach of Fryberg J: see at [59]-[62]. I respectfully agree with and adopt the views of Lindgren J. I share the understanding of his Honour that the purpose and effect of such a clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. The amount of the damages payable for breach of the warranty would be equal to the amount required to discharge the encumbrance. I note that the approach of Lindgren J has been preferred in subsequent cases, including by Robson J in Re Coles Group Limited [2007] VSC 389 at [45] ; by Lander J in Re Adelaide Bank Limited [2007] FCA 1582 at [33] ; and by Gyles J in Orion Telecommunications Ltd [2007] FCA 1389 at [9] .</sentence>
