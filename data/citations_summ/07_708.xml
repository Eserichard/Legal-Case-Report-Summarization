<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] HCA 8">The trial judge held that it would be appropriate to award damages for breach of cl 2.13 based on reinstatement costs only "in a relatively narrow range of cases where a tenant has so damaged or modified premises that they are unlettable at the conclusion [of] the lease" [3] . In this regard he referred to Joyner v Weeks [4] , a case not cited by the parties. He went on to say that normally, however, "reinstatement costs will not be awarded unless there exists some special interest in reinstatement arising from a radical change to the usage to which the property can be put following renovations by the tenant" [5] . He then accepted expert evidence to the effect that whether the lease was to end in 2012 or 2017, the Tenant's changes to the foyer would occasion very little diminution in the value of the building. Accordingly he awarded only $34,820 in damages [6] . 
  The trial judge held that it would be appropriate to award damages for breach of cl 2.13 based on reinstatement costs only "in a relatively narrow range of cases where a tenant has so damaged or modified premises that they are unlettable at the conclusion [of] the lease" [3] . In this regard he referred to Joyner v Weeks [4] , a case not cited by the parties. He went on to say that normally, however, "reinstatement costs will not be awarded unless there exists some special interest in reinstatement arising from a radical change to the usage to which the property can be put following renovations by the tenant" [5] .

Accordingly he awarded only $34,820 in damages [6] . 
  The Landlord pursued claims against the Tenant in the Federal Court of Australia based on many causes of action. Most of them were rejected by the trial judge (Tracey J) for reasons with which the Landlord does not now cavil. The only claim which the trial judge upheld was a claim for common law damages in relation to two breaches by the Tenant of cl 2.13: the destruction of the old foyer up to 14 July 1997, and the construction of a new foyer up to 31 August 1997. He gave judgment for the Landlord in the sum of $34,820: most of that figure was made up of the difference between the value of the property with the old foyer and the value of the property with the new foyer constructed by the Tenant [1] . The Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia increased the judgment sum to $1.38m. That sum comprised $580,000 as the cost of restoring the foyer to its original condition and $800,000 for loss of rent while that restoration was taking place [2] . In this appeal the Tenant seeks restoration of the trial judge's figure. The appeal should be dismissed for the following reasons.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 878">1 I delivered judgment in this matter on 18 May 2007: see [2007] FCA 708. The trial had occupied nine sitting days. The applicant pleaded causes of action in rectification, contractual breach of a lease, waste, unconscionable conduct contrary to ss 51AA and 51AC of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and contraventions of ss 52 and 53 (g) of that Act and sought various forms of relief. In the event the applicant was only successful on the claim that the respondent had breached a clause of the lease which required it to obtain the written approval of the applicant before undertaking significant structural alterations to the leased premises. Damages of $34,820.00 were awarded to the applicant. I invited submissions from the parties as to what costs orders should be made.</sentence>
