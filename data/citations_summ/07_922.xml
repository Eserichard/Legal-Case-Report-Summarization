<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1153">The main claims made by the plaintiff Dartberg Pty Limited ('Dartberg') against Wealthcare related to investments made by Dartberg on the recommendation of Wealthcare in promissory notes issued by two companies Market Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd ('Market Street') and York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd ('York Street'). Each of those companies was within the Westpoint Group of companies which collapsed. A convenient sketch of the background to the raising of monies by way of the promissory notes and the collapse of Westpoint is to be found in the judgment of Finkelstein J in Re York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 922 ; (2007) 162 FCR 358.  As I have said, I do not find it necessary to go further into this matter --- it would involve an analysis of the decision in Emu Brewery Mezzanine WASC 241, and possibly, the decisions of Finkelstein J in Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deakin Financial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1805 ; (2006) 157 FCR 229 and Re York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 922 ; (2007) 162 FCR 358 , and the question of the extent to which I should follow those decisions even if I considered any of them to be error.

25 This was a reference to the decision in the matter of Re York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 922 ; (2007) 162 FCR 358 at [44] . His Honour's conclusion in this respect was based on the following passage in the submissions before him:
 

 
 
 "ABADEE: Yes but there's a very recent decision from Finkelstein J. Ann Street is one of the Mezzanine companies in the group. In York Street, 28 June 2007 his Honour assumed but did not decide that the promissory notes issued in Ann Street were financial products, were interests in a management investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] WASC 262">9 I note that Roche v Douglas as Administrator of the Estate of Edward John Hamilton Rowan (Dec) [2000] WASC 146 (Sanderson M) is authority for the proposition that the word 'property' in O 52 r 3 is capable of including tissue taken from the body of a person who subsequently died. In Roche the learned Master canvassed at some length a range of authorities bearing on the proposition. I consider his conclusion, expressed in the proposition I have described, to be correct. In any event, I consider it is one I should follow unless I consider it to be plainly wrong, which I do not. See In The Matter of York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 922 , Finkelstein J [22].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] NSWSC 689">40 An issue then arises as to whether promissory notes issued or made by the Mezzanine Companies are "securities" within the s 761A definition. The plaintiffs acknowledge that promissory notes created and made by other Westpoint Group companies in circumstances similar to those involving the Mezzanine Companies have been held not to be "securities" within the Corporations Act definition: Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2006] WASCA 105 ; (2006) 32 WAR 204 ; Re York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 922 ; (2007) 162 FCR 358. It may well be that the promissory notes involved in this case are likewise not within the statutory definition. But that would not be determinative, given that the expression "securities" is used in a contract of insurance in relation to which the statutory scheme may provide no more than guidance. In addition, much will depend on the form and content of the particular notes. The proposition that the present circumstances involve "Securities Dealing" in a more general sense remains arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] WASC 63">90 I consider that, particularly in relation to what is in large part if not entirely a problem in the construction of uniform national legislation, I should follow Mideco unless I am convinced, as I am not, that it is 'plainly wrong': In The Matter of York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 922 [22] (Finkelstein J). Indeed, I consider Mideco to be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2007] AATA 1802">The critical part of the paragraph at page 103 consists of the words "unsupported by any agreement" and in this case, there was such an agreement between BMW and the applicant. Ms Deards also cited York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 922. I do not think it necessary to deal with that decision in any detail , except to say that at paragraph 20, Finkelstein J ruled that, "All that is required is an actual agreement by the relevant parties that payment be made by means of entries in books of account.
