<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1045">Such observations do not preclude the prospect that fact-finding may in some cases expose a lack of impartiality and may involve jurisdictional error: NADH , supra. Allsop J there thus observed: 
 
 [115] By and large fact-finding is a task within jurisdiction, though factual error is not necessarily mutually exclusive of jurisdictional error: ... Where fact-finding has been conducted in a manner which can be described, as here, as in substantial respects unreasoned, and mere assertion lacking rational or reasoned foundation, at times as plainly and ex facie wrong and as selective of material going one way, these considerations may found a conclusion that the posited fair-minded observer might, or indeed would, reasonably apprehend that the conclusions had been reached with a mind not open to persuasion and unable or unwilling to evaluate all the material fairly. ...
