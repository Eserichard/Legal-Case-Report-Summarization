<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 561">It follows from my conclusions above that it is unnecessary to consider whether or not Mr Priestley is a person aggrieved or whether or not s 23 of the Federal Court Act is a source of additional jurisdiction. In any event, I considered these grounds in Priestley v Godwin (No 4) [2009] FCA 560 which was heard concurrently with this application and the same conclusions apply. Section 23 of the Federal Court Act is not a source of additional jurisdiction ( Thomson Australian Holdings Proprietary Limited v The Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 at 161). Mr Priestley may not have established that he is a person aggrieved but that does not fall to be determined on this application under s 31A of the Federal Court Act. I am prepared to assume for the purposes of this notice of motion that, had the claimed decision been made, Mr Priestley would have been a person aggrieved. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 594">By applications filed on 3 January 2008, Mr Priestley sought orders pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Federal Court Act') that the respondent(s) in each matter prepare and furnish a statement of reasons pursuant to s 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) for decisions that he characterised and which he said were made. In each case, the respondent(s) sought orders under s 31A of the Federal Court Act for summary dismissal. I concluded in each case that there was no decision as alleged by Mr Priestley. I dismissed each proceeding pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court Act ( Priestley v Godwin (No 4) [2009] FCA 560 ; Priestley v Hawker [2009] FCA 561). The applications for leave to appeal
