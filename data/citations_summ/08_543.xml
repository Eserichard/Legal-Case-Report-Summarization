 59 Mr Bick stated that the research which was conducted on behalf of the plaintiffs on this issue revealed that there have been no reported cases which have considered whether an order should be made under s 597(13) of the Act. To the extent that there has been consideration of that provision, it has concerned technical issues such as whether or not an order was properly made under the section in the absence of an explicit order for the making of a written transcript or whether it is unjust to require an examinee to sign a written transcript without requiring the plaintiff to provide the examinees with the documents referred to in the examination.
