<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 541">Having read the affidavit of Paul Grant Linsdell sworn 18 May 2011, I consider that this proposal should be approved: see Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Ltd [2009] FCA 19 at [32] --- [34] and Darwalla at [17] and [42]. (e) Other relevant factors 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 537">The task of the Court is to determine whether the settlement is "fair and reasonable" . In Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4) [2000] FCA 1925 ; (2000) 180 ALR 459 , at [19] (p 465---466), Goldberg J explained that task in the following way: Ordinarily the task of a court upon an application such as this, is to determine whether the proposed settlement or compromise is fair and reasonable, having regard to the claims made on behalf of the group members who will be bound by the settlement. Ordinarily in such circumstances the court will take into account the amount offered to each group member, the prospects of success in the proceeding, the likelihood of the group members obtaining judgment for an amount significantly in excess of the settlement offer, the terms of any advice received from counsel and from any independent expert in relation to the issues which arise in the proceeding, the likely duration and cost of the proceeding if continued to judgment, and the attitude of the group members to the settlement. In Re General Motors Corp Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Products Liability Litigation [1995] USCA3 325 ; 55 F 3d 768 at 785 (1995) the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit referred to the nine-factor test it had adopted: 
 
 
 
 ... to help district courts structure their final decisions to approve settlements as fair, reasonable and adequate as required by Rule 23(e) [which requires court approval for settlement of class actions]. See Girsh v Jepson [1975] USCA3 523 ; 521 F 2d 153 at 157 (1975) (3rd Cir). Those factors are: (1) the complexity and duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the proceedings; (4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining a class action; (7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of the best recovery; and (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of all the attendant risks of litigation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (See also County of Suffolk v Long Island Lighting Co 907 F 2d 1295 at 1323 (1990) (2nd Cir), 5 Moore's Federal Practice , 3rd ed, p 23---348. ) This nine-factor test is equally helpful in the Australian jurisdiction and I find it a useful guide in considering the present proposed settlement.

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 277">Although s 33V(1) itself imposes no express constraint on the manner in which the Court may either grant of refuse approval, it has repeatedly been said that the task of the Court is to determine whether a proposed settlement is " fair and reasonable ". Thus, by way of example, in Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4) [2000] FCA 1925 , 180 ALR 459 , Goldberg J observed: 
 
 [19] Ordinarily the task of a court upon an application such as this, is to determine whether the proposed settlement or compromise is fair and reasonable, having regard to the claims made on behalf of the group members who will be bound by the settlement. Ordinarily in such circumstances the Court will take into account the amount offered to each group member, the prospects of success in the proceeding, the likelihood of the group members obtaining judgment for an amount significantly in excess of the settlement offer, the terms of any advice received from counsel and from any independent expert in relation to the issues which arise in the proceeding, the likely duration and cost of the proceeding if continued to judgment, and the attitude of the group members to the settlement.

Section 33V(1), it will be noted, applies to both the settlement or discontinuance of a representative proceeding and leave to discontinue will not be granted where it is not " fair and reasonable " to do so: eg, Mercedes Holdings Pty Ltd v Waters (No 1) [2010] FCA 124 , 77 ACSR 265 per Perram J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 1029">It is said that fairness to the funded class members, without whom the proceedings could not have continued, requires that the non-funded group members are in no better position for having been unfunded for a matter of weeks prior to the in-principal settlement having been reached. The effect of applying the "funding equalisation factor" is to redistribute an amount equivalent to the commissions that would have been payable by the non-funded group members between all group members. I believe that, in the circumstances of this case, it would be unreasonable not to apply the proposed funding equalisation factor. Other judges have adopted the same position: see eg Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Ltd [2009] FCA 19. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 667">Being an action commenced under Pt IVA of the FCA, the class action cannot be compromised without the approval of the Court: s 33V of the FCA. The Applicant and Glenhurst seek that approval. The principles that govern approval applications under s 33V of the FCA are well established: see Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Limited [2009] FCA 19 at [10] and [11] and the authorities there cited. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 163">The principles that govern approval applications under s 33V of the FCA are well established: see Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Limited [2009] FCA 19 at [10] and [11] and the authorities there cited. Consistent with these principles, I would approve the proposed settlement of these proceedings. The amount each group member will recover is a substantial proportion of the loss. No group member is required to bear any costs. Some group members may have already, or will in the future, recoup some of their losses from other sources including other litigation initiated by ASIC against others concerned with the collapse of the Westpoint group. The litigation is being settled at a relatively early stage thereby avoiding significant costs and uncertainties and without the need for an examination of the particular facts and circumstances in which each group member invested in the mezzanine notes. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 516">In Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 2008 at [56] to [66], I endeavoured to set out the principles which apply to the exercise of the power under s 33V to approve a settlement. The principles to which I referred were applied by Stone J in Dorajay Pty Ltd v Aristocrat Leisure Limited [2009] FCA 19 at [10] . I will apply those principles in considering the present application. </sentence>
