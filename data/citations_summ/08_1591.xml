<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 682">The following principles are worth restating. A contravention of s 52(1) of the TPA is established by "conduct" which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; 2 FCR 82 , 87.

"Conduct" is likely to mislead or deceive if there is a "real or not remote chance or possibility regardless of whether it is less or more than fifty per cent": Global Sportsman Pty Ltd 2 FCR 82, 87. Section 52(1) is concerned with the effect or likely effect of "conduct" upon the minds of that person or those persons in relation to whom the question of whether the "conduct" is or is likely to be misleading or deceptive falls to be tested. Mention must also be made of s 75B of the TPA. It provides that if a person is "in any way ... knowingly concerned in, or party to" (inter alia) a contravention of s 52 of the TPA by another, that person will be liable for that contravention under ss 82 and 87 of the TPA: Hannaford [2008] FCA 1591 at [256] .  If that is so, an expression of opinion however erroneous misrepresents nothing: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; 2 FCR 82 , 88. However, an opinion may convey that there is a basis for it, that it is honestly held and when it is expressed as the opinion of an expert, that it is honestly held upon rational grounds involving an application of the relevant expertise. If the evidence shows that the opinion was not held or that it lacked any or any adequate foundation, particularly if the opinion was expressed as an expert, a statement of opinion may contravene s 52 of the TPA: Elders Trustee [1987] FCA 332 ; 78 ALR 193 , 242, proposition (4): see also Hannaford [2008] FCA 1591 at [253] and RAIA Insurance Brokers Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd [1993] FCA 92 ; (1993) 41 FCR 164 ; Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 ; NC Seddon and MP Ellinghaus, Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract (9 th Australian Edition, 2008), [11.116].
