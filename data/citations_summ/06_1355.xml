<citphrase id="cp7.15" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">migration act 1958 (cth), ss 6 , 6a. in an application for review of a decision of the minister for immigration and ethnic affairs made in 1984 refusing an application for a permanent entry permit to an applicant who was the spouse of a permanent resident on the basis that the applicant's marriage had been assessed as being one where the parties did not genuinely intend to continue living as a married couple in australia, it being the minister's policy to refuse permanent entry permits in such cases.  held: (1) that relevant considerations which should have been taken into account were not, thus making the minister's decision invalid pursuant to s 5(2)(b) of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (the act), such considerations being:  (i) a report made in 1981 by an interviewing officer in suva expressing an opinion that the marriage relationship was genuine, such report being part of the history of the relationship, all of which was relevant in determining the quality of the marriage as at the date of the minister deciding the application. although the report was not presented to the minister, it was on the departmental file and was accordingly to be regarded as being constructively before him.  peko-wallsend ltd v. minister for aboriginal affairs (1985) 59 alr 51 , referred to.  (ii) statutory declarations of neighbours and acquaintances as to the applicant leading a normal married life and a letter of a social worker as to the applicant's wife living at home with the applicant, such documents being available to the minister, but there being nothing to indicate that he had taken any account of them.  (2) that in determining whether an administrative decision made under statutory authority falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp7.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FMCA 1912">The applicant sought review of the Tribunal decision by application filed in this Court on 2 March 2007. She filed an affidavit on 22 May 2007 addressing the delay in commencing judicial review proceedings. She filed written submissions on 16 October 2007 that raise additional grounds and appear to have been prepared by a person with some legal knowledge who is not identified (cf the remarks of Branson J in NADG of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 893 at [8] --- [11] and NBDF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1355 at [12] ) and also relies on a transcript of the Tribunal hearing. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1318">60 This takes me to the sixth of the Minister's grounds on the hearing of the appeal. On the one hand, the authorities establish that the Tribunal has no general obligation to initiate enquiries or to make out an applicant's case for him or her. These authorities stretch back over the life of the Tribunal: see, for example, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21-22 per Gummow and Hayne JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) and 49 per Callinan J; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF [2005] FCAFC 73 at [20] per Black CJ, Sundberg and Bennett JJ; SBBA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 90 (" SBBA ") at [8] per Weinberg, Stone and Jacobson JJ; Mohammed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 47 at [24] per Moore, North and Emmett JJ; SJSB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 225 at [16] per Ryan, Jacobson and Lander JJ; WAGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 277 at [25] per Heerey, RD Nicholson and Mansfield JJ; NBDF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1355 at [24] - [25] per Branson J ; Tide Sequence Industries Pty Ltd v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 751 ; (2005) 145 FCR 155 at 174 per Conti J; Hong v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1308 at [40] per Finn J; NAYU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 528 at [20] - [21] per Jacobson J; Rahman v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1277 (" Rahman ") at [29] per French J; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Anthonypillai [2001] FCA 274 ; (2001) 106 FCR 426 (" Anthonypillai ") at 445 per Heerey, Goldberg and Weinberg JJ; Kabir v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 248 ; (2001) 184 ALR 295 at 305-306 per Katz J; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Cassim [2000] HCA 50 ; (2000) 175 ALR 209 at 212-213 per McHugh J; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Singh (1997) 74 FCR 553 at 560-561 per Lee J; and Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 (" Prasad ") at 169-170 per Wilcox J. On the other hand, there is authority for the limited proposition that, in certain rare or exceptional circumstances, the Tribunal's failure to enquire may ground a finding of jurisdictional error because the failure may render the ensuing decision manifestly unreasonable in the sense used in Associated Provincial Picture Houses v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223 (" Wednesbury Corporation "). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2006] FCA 1798">21 In NBDF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1355 the appellant had, as here, sought to raise fresh grounds of appeal not relied on before the Federal Magistrates Court. As Branson J pointed out at [22], leave is required to argue on appeal an issue not raised below. There, as here, neither the appellant's written submissions nor his affidavit addressed the basis on which the Court must be satisfied that it is expedient and in the interests of justice for the issue to be raised for the first time on appeal. Her Honour said at [26] that it is not appropriate to grant an appellant leave to raise an issue simply because, as he contended, it would be just to allow him to do so. If the issue upon which an appellant wishes to rely for the first time is without merit, leave should not be granted to raise the issue before this Court.
