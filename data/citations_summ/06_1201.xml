<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 806">The expansive operation of this provision was described by Gyles J in Sims; re Huon Corporation Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1201 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 620. It is not necessary to repeat his Honour's observations, suffice it to say that the nature of the order sought is within the jurisdiction described by his Honour and that the circumstances which have arisen in this case warrant an order for the modification of the Part. See too Farnsworth v ASIC (2007) 25 ACLC 1317 and Forrest Nursery Pty Limited, in the matter of Euco Limited v Lopez and Verge as joint and several liquidators of Euco Limited (In Liquidation) [2006] FCA 935.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1248">In Sims, Re Huon Corporation Pty Limited (administrators appointed) [2006] FCA 1201 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 620 at [11] , Gyles J referred in particular to the width of the power and the need to be satisfied that all persons who might be affected by an order have been effectively given notice of the proceeding, and that none has appeared to oppose the orders. That seems to me, in effect, to be the position today. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 764"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] WASC 161">11 It is well established that s 447A(1) empowers the court in an appropriate case to modify the operation of s 443A to exclude personal liability on the part of a voluntary administrator and to provide that a loan taken out by the company via the voluntary administrator is repayable on a limited course basis. Orders of this type have been made on numerous occasions. Goldberg J made such an order in Re Ansett Ltd (supra) [48]. I made such an order in Re View Gold Pty Ltd [2008] WASC 241 [16] - [178]. However, there is no doubt that this is 'a most unusual power which requires careful consideration before its exercise': see Re Huon Corporation Pty Ltd (administrators appointed) [2006] FCA 1201 ; (2006) 58 ACSR 620 [11]. This is because such an order has substantive effect. Further, it is not easy in most cases - and this is one of them - to grasp all of the ramifications of such an order in the absence of a contradicter. </sentence>
