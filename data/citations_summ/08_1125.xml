<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 208">the Tribunal did not make a finding as to the authenticity or otherwise of the three documents. Rather, the Tribunal put them to one side; [161] the Tribunal took that approach because of what had been said by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the Country Information. [162] Possession of such a report might have reasonably put the Tribunal on guard, but, of itself, went no further than that; [163] as was the case in SZKLK , it does not appear that the Tribunal had any third party information before it as to: whether or not the agency referred to in the documents existed; whether the very documents produced by the applicant, or even that class of document, were or were very likely to be forgeries; and more generally, the practices and procedures of the institution from which the documents produced by the applicant purportedly originated, which might have assisted in forming a view as to their likely authenticity; [164] in this case, it was not permissible for the Tribunal to simply fail to engage with the three documents; [165] consequently, the Tribunal did not take into account a relevant consideration; ie documents which were strongly corroborative of the applicant's claims; it may be noted that the Tribunal did not ask the applicant, nor make any enquiries, as to how the three documents were produced to the Department; and if the Tribunal had engaged with the question which it was obliged to (ie, whether the documents were genuine), then how the documents came to be produced would have been a relevant consideration. As the Applicant's May 2010 Affidavit makes clear, if the applicant had been asked, he would have been able to give evidence in support of the authenticity of those documents. First respondent's submissions
 In respect of ground 3 the first respondent submitted that: the Tribunal may legitimately reject the authenticity of a document on the basis of adverse findings concerning the applicant's credibility; [166] the Tribunal's rejection of the authenticity of the Detention Documents was in accordance with the finding that the applicant did not have any credibility after his credibility had been weakened by questioning in the Tribunal; the Tribunal's treatment of the Detention Documents must be considered in context: the Tribunal had before it advice from DFAT that any official document could be either purchased or forged in China; [167] the Tribunal put the DFAT advice to the applicant; [168] the Tribunal did not regard the applicant's version of events as credible; [169] the Tribunal clearly took into account the Detention Documents, and did so in the context of advice from DFAT; [170] the Tribunal considered that the Detention Documents, having regard to the DFAT advice, did not overcome the problems the Tribunal had with the applicant's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 934">The course of proceedings before the Tribunal does not evidence a basis upon which one might apprehend that the tribunal was biased. I had occasion in SZKLK v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1125 to review various authorities in respect of an apprehended bias claim, and I shall not repeat what is there stated in that regard. It suffices to note that there must be some evidence upon which a reasonable bystander might conclude that the administrative decision-maker or Tribunal was biased even if, in fact, that decision-maker or Tribunal was not actually biased. Once again, the evidence as to the course of the proceedings before the Tribunal does not support such an apprehension. Neither does the Tribunal's reasoning process as disclosed in the Tribunal's published reasons support that. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 712">The Tribunal's rejection of the applicant's claims was based in part on its conclusion about the applicant's lack of credibility. This in turn was based upon the applicant's lack of knowledge of the Catholic Church. This the Tribunal found to be inconsistent with her claim to have attended weekly Church meetings since 2002. An applicant is not expected to " pass an examination in divinity studies ". [45] However, the Tribunal found that the applicant's knowledge of the Catholic Church displayed during the hearing was minimal. That is a factual finding open to the Tribunal on the evidence. The Tribunal's subsequent findings that the applicant had not attended weekly Catholic meetings since 2002, and that the applicant was not detained by virtue of her Catholicism, were therefore reasonable. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 341">This case differs from cases such as NADH , SZKLK v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1125 and NBMB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 149 which concerned the veracity of the applicant's religious beliefs in circumstances where there had been Tribunal questioning on such matters which has led the Federal Court to express some disquiet (see Wang and Others v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 477 ; (2002) 119 FCR 405 and SBCC ). In this case the Tribunal's credibility appraisal related to whether certain claimed past events had occurred. The applicant had not submitted corroborative material in support of his claims and aspects of his submissions could be seen to be vague and general in certain particulars, albeit consistent with country information. In those circumstances the manner in which the Tribunal sought to test the veracity of the applicant's claims during the hearing by reference to differences between his claims as made at the hearing and his claims made in writing or by raising matters which appeared to the Tribunal to be of questionable plausibility does not demonstrate either actual or apprehended bias from the perspective of the appropriately informed, reasonable observer. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 129">The applicant is not expected to " pass an examination in divinity studies ". [41] But, in this case, the evidence indicates that the applicant knew almost nothing of the beliefs and practices of Falun Gong. It was not therefore unreasonable for the Tribunal to make an adverse finding about the applicant's claims, based on its finding as to his " extraordinary absence of knowledge of matters going to the practice of falun gong ". [42] Having regard to that finding, which it was open to the Tribunal to make on the evidence, it was reasonable for the Tribunal not to believe the applicant's claims. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 158">There was also advanced, in the course of oral submissions for the Appellant, the argument that the Federal Magistrates Court and it seems also the Tribunal, were in some way biased. There is not a scintilla of evidence which would support an apprehended bias challenge to the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court. In particular, the fact that that court gave its reasons for judgment upon the day on which the judicial review application was heard, does not support such a finding. As for the Tribunal proceeding, there was not developed before me any argument that the hearing before the Tribunal, in terms of the procedures adopted by the Tribunal, and having regard to its reasons, was such as would give rise to an apprehension of bias of the kind that I found present in SZKLK v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1125. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FCA 1692">18 In SZKLK v Minister For Immigration [2008] FCA 1125 , I had occasion to review various authorities touching upon the administrative law error ground of bias. I shall not repeat what is there stated. One way in which a claim for bias might be made out, in a way which intersects with unreasonableness, is that stated in the passage which I have quoted from in NADH of 2001 . That basis is not made out here. The conclusions reached by the Tribunal are objectively able to be seen as referable to logical consequences of credibility findings reasonably open to the Tribunal. There is not a scintilla of evidence which would support a conclusion of actual bias on the part of the Tribunal. However one approaches the case, the result is nothing more than a consequence of conclusions the Tribunal reached in light of inconsistencies that it found. That result is undoubtedly disappointing to the Appellant, but again, I remind myself that it is no part of my role to descend into the merits of whether the claim should be accepted. There is no error, in my opinion, in the Federal Magistrates rejection of ground 3. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FMCA 1390">In SZKLK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1125 Logan J addressed the Tribunal's consideration of supporting or corroborative documentation provided to it by the applicant in the course of considering whether a Tribunal decision was affected by apprehended bias. His Honour stated at [58] that: Any assessment of the impact, in terms of an apprehended bias challenge, of the Tribunal's treatment of [those documents] must be guided by the cautionary note sounded by McHugh and Gummow JJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 ; Appellant S106/20002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 at 1174, [49] . 
Their Honours stated in Applicant S20/2002 :
 
 [49] In a dispute adjudicated by adversarial procedures, it is not unknown for a party's credibility to have been so weakened in cross-examination that the tribunal of fact may well treat what is proffered as corroborative evidence as of no weight because the well has been poisoned beyond redemption. It cannot be irrational for a decision-maker, enjoined by statute to apply inquisitorial processes (as here), to proceed on the footing that no corroboration can undo the consequences for a case put by a party of a conclusion that that case comprises lies by that party. If the critical passage in the reasons of the Tribunal be read as indicated above, the Tribunal is reasoning that, because the appellant cannot be believed, it cannot be satisfied with the alleged corroboration. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 1119">Had the Tribunal in fact been addressing the applicant's claim as put, disquiet of the nature considered by Logan J in SKLK v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1125 at [56] might well be aroused in relation to the Tribunal's consideration of the applicant's knowledge of Christianity in light of its rejection of Pastor Boyd's evidence partly by reference to what might be regarded as a single typographical error, given that elsewhere in that letter and in all the other letter from Pastor Boyd to the Tribunal the pastor had not mistaken the applicant's gender and had referred to his particular circumstances, including the specific evidence he gave in the interview with the delegate. However the fact that the Tribunal overlooked or misunderstood and hence failed to consider the claim about conversion to evangelical Christianity in Nepal or to address the applicant's conduct in Australia from that perspective is not of itself such as to establish apprehended bias in the manner contended for by the applicant. </sentence>
