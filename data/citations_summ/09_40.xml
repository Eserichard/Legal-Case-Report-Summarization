<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1397">Szencorp Pty Ltd v Clean Energy Council Limited [2009] FCA 40 ; (2009) 69 ACSR 365 , was also an "oppression" case brought in reliance upon the current statutory equivalent, s 232 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), in relation to the conduct of the affairs of an unlisted not-for-profit public company limited by guarantee. It was an entity formed to effect a merger of two existing sustainable energy industry associations. Goldberg J at [59] remarked in the course of his reasons: 
 
 The "contrary to the interests" provision now contained in subpar (d) of s 232 has a separate and distinct area of operation from the "oppression" provisions in subpar (e) of s 232. The manner in which a company is being administered and in which its affairs are conducted may fall within the category of conduct contrary to the interests of the company's members as a whole although it may not be described as oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against members of the company: Turnbull v National Roads &amp; Motorists' Association Limited [2004] NSWSC 577 ; (2004) 50 ACSR 44 at 52, 57; Campbell v BackOffice Investments Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 95 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 359 at 400. (See also Re Spargos Mining NL (1990) 3 ACSR 1 at 42; Shelton v NRMA Limited [2004] FCA 1393 ; (2005) 51 ACSR 278. ) An example of such conduct may be found where a company is formed for the purpose of undertaking particular activities but the directors and management disregard those activities and direct the company into different commercial areas.

86 In my view, any order under s 233 must deal with the unit holdings as well as the shares in the CPS companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 844">As was pointed out in Szencorp Pty Ltd v Clean Energy Council Ltd [2009] FCA 40 ; (2009) 69 ACSR 365 at 378-379: 
 "The 'contrary to the interests' provision now contained in subpara (d) of s 232 [of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)] has a separate and distinct area of operation from the 'oppression' provisions in subpara (e) of s 232. The manner in which a company is being administered and in which its affairs are conducted may fall within the category of conduct contrary to the interests of the company's members as a whole although it may not be described as oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against members of the company"
