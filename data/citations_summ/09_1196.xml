<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1515">For the reasons provided in a previous judgment in respect of this matter Comcare v John Holland Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1196 I allowed members of Mr McCallum's family to file impact evidence statements with the Court, which I have read. While, as I indicated in my interlocutory judgment, their statements were accepted on the basis that they would not be taken into account for the purposes of determining the appropriate penalty in this case, the Court extends its sympathy to the family of Mr McCallum, and acknowledges the extreme pain and anguish caused them by the loss of Mr McCallum. I certify that the preceding fifty-three (53) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier. Associate:
