I find no error in her Honour's conclusion in that regard. I agree with Emmett FM that the Tribunal did consider the appellant's claims in detail and explored those claims with him. The appellant has not pointed to any claim or any aspect of a claim with which the Tribunal did not deal. </sentence>
