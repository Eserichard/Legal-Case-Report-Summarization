[1] Relevantly for this decision, the applicable criteria are those prescribed under subsection 9(b) and Item 114 of Part 2 of Schedule 1. Pursuant to Item 114 of the Rules, the proposed premises must be in a rural locality and at least 10km, by the shortest lawful access route, from the nearest approved premises. 
  In essence, the High Court in Shi held that there is nothing in the Tribunal's enabling legislation that confines it to the facts and circumstances before the primary-decision maker. The exception to this general principle is that, if the statute under which the decision under review was made limits the review to the particular time in the past, then the Tribunal will similarly be limited to the state of affairs existing at that relevant time. [2] Kiefel J stated in Shi at [142]: 
 
 In considering what is the right decision, the tribunal must address the same question as the original decision-maker was required to address. Identifying the question raised by the statute for decision will usually determine the facts which may be taken into account in connection with the decision. The issue is then one of relevance, determined by reference to the elements in the question, or questions, necessary to be addressed in reaching a decision.</sentence>
