DECISION: 
1. Leave is granted to the Plaintiffs under s.6(4) Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 to commence proceedings against LawCover Insurance Pty Limited. 23 In evidence on the present application are judgments of Emmett J of the Federal Court of Australia in Colonial Mutual Superannuation Pty Limited v Flammia (No. 2) [2007] FCA 1655 (1 November 2007) and Colonial Mutual Superannuation Pty Limited v Flammia (No. 3) [2007] FCA 2104 (7 December 2007) (Exhibit TRP1, pages 1-43). In those proceedings ("the Colonial proceedings"), Colonial Mutual Superannuation Pty Limited ("Colonial") sued Mr Flammia and William Anastasiadis, alleging that they had induced Colonial by fraud to cause a cheque in the sum of $438,802.80 to be drawn in favour of Stanley G Stevens. The cheque was sent to Mr Flammia. Mr Flammia sought indemnity from LawCover under a professional indemnity policy of insurance. By the policy, LawCover agreed to indemnify Mr Flammia against civil liability for any claim that arose from his legal practice, and that was first made against him during the period of insurance. However, the policy provided that LawCover would not indemnify Mr Flammia for a claim that arose from any dishonest or fraudulent acts or omissions on his part, whether directly or indirectly. LawCover did not accept liability to indemnify under the policy and thus Mr Flammia filed a cross claim against LawCover.</sentence>
