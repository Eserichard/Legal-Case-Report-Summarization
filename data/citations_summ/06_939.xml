<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1469">62 The Applicants advanced a submission based on the proposition that s 251A was premised on the existence of a single community or other group and that the section could not apply if the community or group were not established on the evidence. Support for this submission was said to be found in the reasons for judgment of Branson J in Kemp v Native Title Registrar [2006] FCA 939 ; (2006) 153 FCR 38. It is true that, in that case, her Honour opined (at 47, [41]):
 
 
 41 Section 251A is not intended to provide, and does not provide, a means whereby a single authorising decision can be obtained which is binding on two or more groups where their respective claims to hold native title in an area are in conflict. This can be seen from the reference in paragraph (a) to a process of decision-making that, under the traditional laws and customs of the persons who hold or may hold the common or group rights comprising the native title, must be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind. It is hard to imagine any such process of decision-making where the respective claims of two groups to hold the native title are in conflict; it would require traditional laws and customs in relation to jointly authorising things binding on the members of both groups.  59 Both the Applicants' and QWI's submissions proceeded upon the assumption that it was s 251Athat fell for consideration in relation to "authorisation". The explanation given to cl 24CG(3)(b) in the explanatory memorandum to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 which, after further amendments not presently relevant were incorporated, became the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (Cth), which inserted s 24CG and s 251A into the Native Tile Act , makes reference to "potential native title holders" and also makes reference to cl. 251A as supplying the method of authorisation. Finally, in Kemp v Native Title Registrar [2006] FCA 939 ; (2006) 153 FCR 38 , which was a case where the native title group included those who were but potential native title holders, Branson J and all parties to that case evidently proceeded upon the assumption that s 251A fell for consideration in relation to the authorisation of an ILUA.</sentence>
