 78 Central Piggery was cited with approval recently by Kenny J in Handbury Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1787 at [73] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCAFC 141">1 For the financial year ended 30 June 2005 the respondent Commissioner assessed the taxpayer's income to two capital gains of $16,934,891 and $50,226,752. The taxpayer objected to the assessment on the grounds that the first capital gain did not arise and that the second was overstated by $9,205,469. The Commissioner disallowed the taxpayer's objection. An application to set aside that decision was rejected by a judge of this Court: Handbury Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1787. From that dismissal the taxpayer now appeals. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 187">25 It is necessary to start with the legislation: see [8] to [19] above. The consolidation regime in Pt 3-90 of the ITAA97 permits certain groups of entities to be treated as a single entity for income tax purposes: see s 700-1. Two of the more significant consequences of consolidation are stipulated in the Act: see s 700-1. First, subsidiary members are treated as part of the head company of the group rather than separate income tax entities. Secondly, the head company "inherits [the] income tax history" of the group's subsidiary members: s 700-1; see also s 701-5; Handbury Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1787 at [15] - [16]. As s 700-1 goes on to provide, the consolidation regime is "supported by rules" that (1) "determine the income tax history that is taken into account" and (2) "deal with the transfer of tax attributes such as ... franking credits to the head company" when entities become subsidiary members of the group: see s 700-1.</sentence>
