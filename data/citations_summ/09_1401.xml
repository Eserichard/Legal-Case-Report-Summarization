<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 415">The Commissioner chose to cross-examine the witnesses of the applicants and in particular Mr Clark and Mr Denoon to explore the circumstances which prevailed, during the relevant period, between the relevant entities pending Mr Denoon making, if possible, a capital contribution of $1.8m to the CU Trust. As to those circumstances, regard should be had to the primary judgment: Clark v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1401. The cross-examination of those witnesses led to explanations by Mr Clark and Mr Denoon as to the circumstances in which neither a company controlled by Mr Denoon, Gemridge Pty Ltd, nor Mr Denoon were to enjoy any right to the income of the CU Trust nor any claim upon the assets of the CU Trust in the relevant period unless and until Mr Denoon made a contribution of $1.8m or, in the absence of a contribution by the agreed date, a transfer of Mr Denoon's interest in the CU Trust. The examination of those facts in controversy between the parties resulted in findings of fact reflected at [87] of the principal judgment.  Background
 On 30 November 2009 the Court pronounced judgment in each appeal by Mr and Mrs Clark ("the applicants") from the Commissioner's appealable objection decision dated 27 October 2006: Clark v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1401. The Court published the reasons for allowing each appeal and adjourned each application to 14 December 2009 for the making of formal orders in light of the published reasons. On 14 December 2009 the Court made the following two substantive orders in each application: The appeal be allowed.
