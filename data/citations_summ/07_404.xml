<citphrase id="cp2.15" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">migration act 1958 (cth), ss 6 , 6a. in an application for review of a decision of the minister for immigration and ethnic affairs made in 1984 refusing an application for a permanent entry permit to an applicant who was the spouse of a permanent resident on the basis that the applicant's marriage had been assessed as being one where the parties did not genuinely intend to continue living as a married couple in australia, it being the minister's policy to refuse permanent entry permits in such cases.  held: (1) that relevant considerations which should have been taken into account were not, thus making the minister's decision invalid pursuant to s 5(2)(b) of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (the act), such considerations being:  (i) a report made in 1981 by an interviewing officer in suva expressing an opinion that the marriage relationship was genuine, such report being part of the history of the relationship, all of which was relevant in determining the quality of the marriage as at the date of the minister deciding the application. although the report was not presented to the minister, it was on the departmental file and was accordingly to be regarded as being constructively before him.  peko-wallsend ltd v. minister for aboriginal affairs (1985) 59 alr 51 , referred to.  (ii) statutory declarations of neighbours and acquaintances as to the applicant leading a normal married life and a letter of a social worker as to the applicant's wife living at home with the applicant, such documents being available to the minister, but there being nothing to indicate that he had taken any account of them.  (2) that in determining whether an administrative decision made under statutory authority falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp2.16" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 47">(a) the court should construe that paragraph in the light of the common law principle of which that paragraph is a legislative enactment, that principle being stated by lord diplock in bromley london borough city council v. greater london council (1983) 1 ac 768 to be the invalidation of administrative decisions "that looked at objectively are so devoid of any plausible justification that no reasonable body of persons could have reached them" and by menzies j in parramatta city council v. pestell [1972] hca 59 ; (1972) 128 clr 305 to be the invalidation of an administrative decision "based on an opinion which could not be justified on any reasonable grounds".  perkins v. cuthill [1981] fca 44 ; (1981) 34 alr 669 ; plegas v. mccabe (unreported, federal court of australia, lockhart j, 3 august 1984; willara pty ltd v. mcveigh (1984) 54 alr 65 ; re w (an infant) (1971) ac 682 ; associated provincial picture houses v. wednesbury corporation [1947] ewca civ 1 ; (1948) 1 kb 223 ; secretary of state for education and science v. tameside metropolitan borough council [1976] ukhl 6 ; (1977) ac 1014 ; borkovic v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs (1981) 39 alr 186 ; hamblin v. duffy [1981] fca 38 ; (1981) 50 flr 308 ; mixnam's properties ltd v. chertsey urban district council (1964) 1 qb 214 , referred to.  (b) the court is entitled to consider those facts which were known to the decision-maker actually or constructively together only with such additional facts as the decision-maker would have learned but for any unreasonable conduct by him where such facts are obtainable from material that is readily available.  (3) that, having taken further evidence relating to the matters arising out of the interviews by the departmental officer, and having reviewed and analysed the evidence and the manner in which the decision was reached by the minister, and bearing in mind the strength of the case required before it may be said that a decision falls within s 5(2)(g) of the act, the minister's decision was "devoid of any plausible justification" and that it accordingly be set aside pursuant to that paragraph of the act and the matter remitted to the minister for further consideration. in reaching this decision the court took into account, inter alia, the following matters:  (i) the existence of the statutory declarations and the social worker's letter asserting that there was a normal marriage relationship, the declarants and writer thereof being apparently credible and independent and such documents asserting a conclusion contrary to that formed by the minister and the fact that the minister had not further investigated the statements contained in those documents as he ought to have done.  (ii) that the only matters tending to show lack of intention to live together were the circumstances of the marriage four years earlier and more importantly, interviews by a departmental officer of the applicant and his wife, such interviews containing inconsistencies in their recollection of details in their daily lives, the minister believing that such inconsistencies indicated that the wife did not live with her husband. the interviewing officer should have given the applicant an opportunity to deal with those matters which excited an adverse reaction in the officer before permitting those matters to be used in a manner adverse to the applicant in the decision-making process.  (iii) the interviews which were relied upon by the minister as the primary method of determining the genuineness of the relationship were rushed and short and in any case, neither a verbatim record nor at least contemporaneous notes of the interviews were made and kept, as ought to have been done.  hearing  sydney, 1985, february 5-6, 26.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] AATA 331">It can be accepted that the cause of Ms Netherwood's myalgia condition is not presently known, but a diagnosis does not require clear identification of cause. Many are the diseases that may be described diagnostically without a clear understanding of precise cause; one only has to consider the case of many cancers for example. Unfortunately, too, the cause of some chronic pain conditions is not well understood. It appears that Ms Netherwood's generalised myalgia may be in this category. It is possible that further investigations or advances in medical science may ultimately deliver an explanation, but such possibilities are presently speculative and not supported by evidence. It is not appropriate to determine Ms Netherwood's claim for DSP on such speculative grounds, nor, to my mind, is it presently necessary to undertake further investigations addressing this point [35] . If the existence of a critical fact may easily be ascertained, it may be necessary to undertake further inquiries for the purposes of review [36] , but I am not persuaded some other diagnosis of Ms Netherwood's pain condition is required for the purposes of section 94 of the Act or, even if it was, that any such diagnosis could easily be ascertained.  As I have said Dr Coleman diagnosed " depression with anxiety " on 25 January 2008 and it is likely that his prescription of Cipramil in or about January 2010 was treatment for this condition, at least in part. It is not appropriate to reject Ms Netherwood's claim simply because her depression with anxiety had been treated in a conventional manner or that further examination by another medical practitioner might suggest some other diagnosis or another form of treatment [38] . </sentence>

 It is troubling that an applicant presenting with a long standing diagnosed condition being treated in a conventional fashion should be rejected for a benefit, not because of any identified defect in diagnosis or treatment but, rather, upon the basis that further examination by another medical practitioner or other practitioners might suggest some other diagnosis or some other treatment.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] AATA 707">In her job capacity assessment and in the course of her evidence, Ms Shand said that this condition had not been "fully treated" because as at 3 September 2008, Mr Petsios was waiting for an appointment with the Urology Clinic, and Dr Neroni, in his report of May 2009, said that he was waiting for further specialist review and investigations. I do not think that the comment made by Ms Shand is a correct assessment of the position. Ms Shand was not aware that Mr Petsios had been receiving treatment from a urologist for a period of about one year prior to claiming DSP. The fact that Mr Petsios had sought a second opinion from another urologist does not, in my view, mean that the condition had not been treated. Further, having regard to the treatment he had previously received from the first specialist, it does not follow that the request for the second opinion would have led to any further treatment or to any improvement in the condition. Gyles J said in Harris v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCA 404 ; (2007) 158 FCR 252 at [17] :

An adversarial system was described by Sir Anthony Mason in the following passage where he touched upon what is said about what is often referred to as an inquisitorial system adopted in European courts:
 
" The principal reason why the European system has attractions for some critics of the adversarial system is that control lies more in the hands of the judges and because the European courts are said to have as their object the investigation of the truth. Within the adversarial system, despite some statements to the contrary, the function of the courts is not to pursue the truth but to decide on the cases presented by the parties. " [91] </sentence>
