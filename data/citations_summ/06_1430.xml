 JUDGMENT 
 

 The proceedings 
 

 
1 The plaintiff, Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Limited, is a mortgage insurer which is in the business of providing lenders mortgage insurance, [LMI policies], to financial institutions that lend on the security of registered mortgages over real property:
 
 
 
 The references to GE Insurance Pty Limited or GE Mortgage Insurance Services may all be read as a reference to Genworth for the reason that Genworth acquired the insurance business of GE Capital and Mortgage Insurance Corporation on 31 March 2004 and so much of the paper work that was being used at the time was old GE paper work.  


 
20 Counsel for the plaintiff took the Court to the decision in Vero Lenders Mortgage Insurance Ltd v Taylor Byrne Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1430 , which appears to be the only decision, in relation to the Australian Property Institute (API) Residential Valuation and Security Assessment Pro-forma Valuation Instrument and Supporting Memorandum , which supports the proposition that that particular Supporting Memorandum gives content to the relevant duty of care. At [50] Greenwood J noted: 
 
 
 
 In preparing the valuation, Mr Duffield was undertaking professional tasks which gave rise to a duty to exercise all reasonable care, skill and diligence as a competent valuer in preparing the valuation and security assessment contained within the Pro-forma Report compiled in accordance with the Supporting Memorandum.  53 The memorandum gives content to the duty owed by Hodder Rook to Genworth (see Kenny &amp; Good [1999] HCA 25 ; (1999) 199 CLR 413 (see McHugh J at 439 [58], Kirby and Callinan JJ at 456 [116] Gummow J at [83], Vero Lenders v Taylor Byrne [2006] FCA 1430 at [50] ).</sentence>
