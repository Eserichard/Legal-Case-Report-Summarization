<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 378">Mr Wilkinson has, in his report, projected the position of Gordian, on the assumption that two other schemes similar to the scheme proposed by MMI are completed. One of those schemes, that in relation to Cavell Insurance Co Limited, has been confirmed by the Court by order made on 22 December 2008, see Cavell Insurance Co Ltd, in the matter of Cavell Insurance Co Ltd (2008) FCA 1984. Another scheme in respect of Sphere Drake Insurance Limited is listed before the Court in several weeks for the hearing of an application for confirmation. Mr Wilkinson projects the position of Gordian following completion of all three schemes and concludes that the position of all policy holders of Gordian, including the transferring policy holders in respect of the three transferring companies, will be well in excess of the minimum solvency coverage required by APRA. </sentence>
