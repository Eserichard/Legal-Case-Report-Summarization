<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 827">12 The Minister concedes that a mere general affirmation of the correctness of information in a statutory declaration used for the purpose of a protection visa application is insufficient to satisfy the exception provided by s 424A(3)(b) of the Act. However, the Minister relies upon the appellant's acknowledgement that he had typed the statutory declaration, answered questions and was able to provide his understanding of a statutory declaration. The Minister submits that it was thereby adopted by him: see VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; [2006] 154 FCR 302 at [49] - [50]. For these reasons the Minister submits that the appellant provided the information in his statutory declaration to the Tribunal and that the exemption provided by s 424A(3)(b) applies to such information: see SZFXG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 116 and SZEPI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1645. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FMCA 754">SZEEU (at [91], [173] and [264]) held that information does not cease to be information given for the purpose of the application for review, even if it can also be derived from an alternative source. To the extent, therefore, that the Tribunal relies on what it says is information in the protection visa application, and that this "differs significantly from what was said at the hearing", this information, having been provided by the applicant subsequently (republished) for the purposes of the review, is brought within the exception contained in s.424A(3)(b) of the Act . (See also SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034 at [6] , SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 611 , and SZEPI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1645). 37. Given the situation as set out immediately above, it is not necessary to consider the Minister's second basis for asserting that there is no breach of s.424A of the Act in relation to this information.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 51">The first respondent urges me not to follow this decision of Conti J because she says there is a later decision of Greenwood J also on appeal from a Federal Magistrate in SZEPI v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 1645.</sentence>
