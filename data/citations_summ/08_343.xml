<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1469">Commonwealth taxation legislation must necessarily provide for a taxpayer to have the ability to have recourse to an exercise of judicial power so as to contest a decision by the Commissioner that he is subject to a taxation liability: see the High Court authorities to which I refer in Russell v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 343 ; (2008) 168 FCR 330 at 333, [13] . The administrative decision by which that liability is ascertained is an assessment, not an objection decision. The latter decision might result in the confirmation or varying of an assessment but it remains an assessment by which the taxable income and the tax payable thereon is, in the absence of further challenge, fixed for a given income year. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 1224">Mr Russell's work as an accountant and his ambitions for his premises have given rise both to income tax and to goods and services tax controversies. These have come to manifest themselves in appeals under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (TAA). In an interlocutory judgement delivered last year I concluded that it was both lawfully possible for him to join his appeals in the one application and that the overlap in the underlying facts was such that it was in the interests of justice that his income tax and goods and services tax (GST) appeals be heard together: Russell v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 343 ; (2008) 168 FCR 330. </sentence>
