<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] ATMO 82">In Pfizer Products Inc. v. Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2007) 70 IPR 599 ; (2007) AIPC 92-232 , after reviewing the decided authorities, and in particular in considering whether such matters should be decided in summary manner or only on clear proof, Gyles J said of the onus in trade mark oppositions (at paragraph 26): 
I am faced with the clear words of the statute, on one hand, and the opinions of various judges, on the other. There is no binding Full Court authority. I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard. In my opinion, in this case, comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute.

I will, therefore, approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition, although not clearly establish such a ground, whether in a summary fashion or otherwise.  See also Chocolaterie Guylian N.V. v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891 (18 August 2009) at [22] to [26]. The standard of the onus may nevertheless still be considered a live issue although, in my opinion, it has not been changed by the more recent decision of Lander J in Hills Industries Limited v Bitek Pty Ltd [2011] FCA 94 whose words at paragraphs 54-55 were clearly obiter and his Honour was in any event discussing section 56 of the Act rather than section 52: 
In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; 66 IPR 131 I said that I should follow the decision in Lomas because it was a decision of the Full Court and I should follow Bennett J's decision in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 901 ; 132 FCR 326 as a matter of comity and because other judges of the Court had followed that decision. That is still my opinion. It may be, as Gyles J has pointed out, that the decision in Lomas was obiter and does not strictly need to be followed but it is a decision of the Full Court in circumstances where there are competing lines of authority at first instance which have left judges of this Court divided. The conflict cannot be resolved at first instance and must be resolved in the Full Court. As I indicated in Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; 66 IPR 131 , I favour the reasoning of Gyles J in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skincare Brands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1517 ; 61 IPR 130 but thought because of Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2002] FCAFC 413 ; [2003] AIPC 91-839 and comity I should follow the other line of authority. That is still my view, notwithstanding the criticism of that approach in Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; 237 ALR 787. [Stress added]

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] ATMO 80">Initially, I must state that any ground of opposition can only succeed if I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it has been established.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2011] ATMO 78">So, in the context of this opposition, the onus on the opponent to make its case upon the balance of probabilities, [6] translates to the opponent bearing an initial onus of establishing on the balance of probabilities that the opposed trade mark is not, or is not sufficiently, inherently adapted to distinguish the applicant's services from the goods or services of other persons as to qualify for registration on that basis alone. Under those circumstances, the onus shifts back to the applicant, who must then demonstrate, by means of evidence or other circumstances, that the trade mark actually does or will distinguish its services. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2011] ATMO 77">While accepting that the balance of probabilities was the relevant standard of proof for trade mark opposition proceedings, Mr Altan made reference to Justice Bennett's comments in Torpedoes Sportswear v Thorpedo Enterprises [1] regarding whether a trade mark should 'clearly not be registered'. This view was a tentative one made by the Full Federal Court in Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2] in relation to an appeal to the Court under section 56 of the Act. It is worth noting that this higher standard of proof has been discussed by Justice Gyles in Pfizer Products v Karam [3] and revisited by Justice Lander in Hills Industries v Bitek [4] . Both cases provide detailed arguments on the issue, but Gyles J noted that the Full Federal Court is yet to apply 'clearly not be registered' or to turn on the difference between the standards of proof. </sentence>

'The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute' per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 19 ; (1987) 163 CLR 1 ; cited with approval by Mason CJ, Wilson, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1989] HCA 5 ; (1989) 166 CLR 417 at 439. I will, therefore, approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition, although not clearly establish such a ground, whether in a summary fashion or otherwise.  In submissions Mr Bell, for CADCAM, referred to the recent decision of Lander J in Hills Industries Limited v Bitek Pty Ltd [2011] FCA 94 as an authority for the view that an opposition should be clearly established. Lander J's words at paragraphs 54-55 were obiter and his Honour was in any event discussing section 56 of the Act rather than section 52: 
In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; 66 IPR 131 I said that I should follow the decision in Lomas because it was a decision of the Full Court and I should follow Bennett J's decision in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 901 ; 132 FCR 326 as a matter of comity and because other judges of the Court had followed that decision. That is still my opinion. It may be, as Gyles J has pointed out, that the decision in Lomas was obiter and does not strictly need to be followed but it is a decision of the Full Court in circumstances where there are competing lines of authority at first instance which have left judges of this Court divided. The conflict cannot be resolved at first instance and must be resolved in the Full Court. As I indicated in Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; 66 IPR 131 , I favour the reasoning of Gyles J in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skincare Brands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1517 ; 61 IPR 130 but thought because of Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2002] FCAFC 413 ; [2003] AIPC 91-839 and comity I should follow the other line of authority.

In my view, there is nothing in the relevant provisions that supports the imposition of a higher standard, even at the acceptance stage. The "presumption of registrability" arises from s 33 of the Act: ... Section 33 does not speak of being "clearly satisfied"; it mandates acceptance of an application unless the Registrar "is satisfied that ... that there are grounds for rejecting it". On this point, I prefer the views expressed by Gyles J and in particular his honour's observations that an acceptance that there is a presumption of registrability "says nothing as to the standard of proof" and does not import a higher threshold than the conventional balance of probabilities: see Pfizer [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 at [18]

In this regard, the currently-prevailing view (as expressed by Justice Gyles in Pfizer Products Inc. v.

Submissions to that effect were accepted in the decision of Justice Jagot in Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc. v. Goulimis [2008] FCA 1415 ; (2008) AIPC 92-307 (but in the absence of argument to the contrary). More recently, the finding of Justice Gyles has been discussed with approval by Justice Sundberg in Chocolaterie Guylian NV v. Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891. The practice of the Registrar is to follow the current approach which is taken by the Federal Court of Australia, namely that a ground of opposition is required to be established on the balance of probabilities, and I propose to adopt that approach. (c) Relevant Time
  In Opposition proceedings, the onus is on an opponent to establish the grounds of opposition upon which reliance is placed (Section 55 of the Act; Medley Distilling Company v. Croakers Gully (Australia) Pty. Limited (2000) 53 IPR 430 ; Kowa Co Limited v. NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; (2005) 66 IPR 131 at paragraph 141; Pfizer Products Inc. v. Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 at paragraph 26). It is sufficient for only one ground to be made out in order for an opponent to succeed in Opposition proceedings (section 55 of the Act).

 Section 60: Trade mark similar to trade mark that has acquired a reputation in Australia 
 
The registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services may be opposed on the ground that:
 
 (a) another trade mark had, before the priority date for the registration of the first-mentioned trade mark in respect of those goods or services, acquired a reputation in Australia; and
 (b) because of the reputation of that other trade mark, the use of the first-mentioned trade mark would be likely to deceive or cause confusion.

<sentence id="cs61" from="[2010] ATMO 98">To establish a ground of opposition under section 43 , there must be an inherent connotation within the trade mark as indicated by Justice Gyles' comments in Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [4] . To clarify the intention of the section, it is worth referring to the statements of Justice Spender in Winton Shire Council v Lomas [5] where he said: 
 Section 43 is directed to the mark itself. It is not concerned with any deception or confusion caused by the reputation in Australia of some other trade mark. That aspect of the matter is dealt with under s60.  I proceed on the basis that the opponent bears the onus of establishing one of the nominated grounds of opposition namely sections 41 , 43 , 58 or 60 of the Act on the balance of probabilities. [2] The opponent's evidence contains certain unsupported allegations regarding the conduct of the applicant both in the United States and Australia.

Prior to the hearing, the opponent indicated that it would only press sections 44 , 42 (b) and 60 as the relevant grounds of opposition under the Act.

  In Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [5] ("HERBAGRA"), to take a further example, Gyles J put it this way: 
'Connotation' is a secondary meaning implied by the mark. The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself. It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s 43 is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question, rather than, for example, deception by reason of some similarity with other marks...

The comments of Justice Gyles in Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2] outlined the history of section 43 of the Act, stating that: 
 Section 43 does not have a long pedigree. It was enacted pursuant to Australia's obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). TRIPS and the 1992 Working Party Report led to a 1994 Bill containing the following cl 42(2):
 
 'An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding: 
 
 (a) the nature, quality, origin, intended purpose, or some other characteristic, of the goods or services; or 

 
 (b) any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person. In opposition proceedings before the Registrar, the opponent bears the onus of establishing a ground of opposition stated in the notice on the balance of probabilities. [1] My reasoning in this matter is made on that basis.

In this regard, as mentioned earlier, s 10 of the Act expressly provides that "a trade mark is taken to be deceptively similar to another trade mark if it so nearly resembles that other trade mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion". The fact that I have already found the Trade Marks are not deceptively similar to any of the registered device marks relied upon by the Opponent in terms of ss 44 and 10 of the Act is however not of itself determinative for the s 60 comparison, since how the Opponent had used the packaging mark and the mark's subsequent reputation as at the Priority Date now inform the comparison [12] .

 [21] ... Whether a ground of opposition has been 'established' is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation.

I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard. In my opinion, in this case, comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute.

Submissions to that effect were accepted in the decision of Justice Jagot in Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc. v. Goulimis (2008) AIPC 92-307 (but in the absence of argument to the contrary). More recently, the finding of Justice Gyles has been discussed with approval by Justice Sundberg in Chocolaterie Guylian NV v. Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 891. The view which is presently accepted by delegates of the Registrar is that there is no special or high standard of proof which is imposed on an opponent. (d) Relevant Time
  In Opposition proceedings, the onus is on an opponent to establish the grounds of opposition upon which reliance is placed (Section 55 of the Act; Medley Distilling Company v. Croakers Gully (Australia) Pty. Limited (2000) 53 IPR 430 ; Kowa Co Limited v. NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; (2005) 66 IPR 131 at paragraph 141; Pfizer Products Inc. v. Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 at paragraph 26). It is only necessary and sufficient for one ground to be made out in order for an opponent to succeed in Opposition proceedings (Section 57 of the Act). (c) Standard of Proof

 Evidence in Support 
 Statutory Declaration of Richard Jelacic dated 29 th October 2008 (with attached Annexures A-E). Reasons
 
  The opponent's remaining ground of opposition is that the applicant's trade mark contains an inherent connotation which would be likely to, if used on the claimed goods and services, cause confusion in the Australian marketplace. To establish this ground, there must be an inherent connotation within the trade mark itself, [9] rather than a connotation as a result of any external factors. </sentence>

  There are certain elements or indicia which apply in relation to Section 60 and which should be borne in mind. Section 60 focuses on reputation. That Section is concerned with whether the use of the trade mark in respect of which registration is sought would be likely to deceive or cause confusion by reason of the reputation in Australia of another trade mark. In the words of Justice Gyles: 
 Section 60 depends upon the Opponent's mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them.

  Like proof in any other matter under civil or administrative law the intentions or lack thereof of an applicant must be assessed on the balance of probabilities and the onus of proof can shift [22] . Under s. 59 , however, the opponent does not need to prove its case, it has only to do enough to shift the onus of proof to the applicant. Thus, the opponent is only required to bring in material sufficient to shift the onus from itself onto the shoulders of the applicant [23] . The mere nomination of the s. 59 ground cannot shift the onus [24] . Hearing Officer Kirov, in Apple Inc v Artistic Licence International [25] , has recently described the potential shifting of onus from opponent to applicant under s. 59 thus: 
[T]he High Court's decision in Aston v Harlee Manufacturing Co [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 is longstanding authority that applying to register a trade mark is prima facie evidence of intention to use. Subsequent decisions indicate this prima facie presumption may be rebutted where the evidence readily gives rise to the drawing of an adverse inference and that evidence remains unchallenged and unrebutted by the applicant. [26] The onus does not however shift to an applicant merely because an opponent questions the applicant's intention in its Notice of Opposition or submissions. [27]

In Kowa , Lander J expressed some doubt about the point but considered he was bound by Lomas and the Full Court decision in Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365. Gyles J has on two occasions expressed a different view: see Clinique Laboratories v Luxury Skincare Brands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1517 ; (2003) 61 IPR 130 at [132] and Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 at [6] - [26] ( Pfizer ). His Honour considered the higher Lomas standard in some detail in Pfizer . After an exhaustive review of the authorities, and noting that the observations in Lomas itself were "plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument", his Honour stated at [21]:
 
The fundamental difficulty with [the respondent's] argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s 55. In Guylian , Sundberg J notes the view of Gyles J in Clinique Laboratories v Luxury Skincare Brands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1517 ; (2003) 61 IPR 130 at [132] and Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 at [6] - [26]. Relevantly, Sundberg J notes: 
In reliance on Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2002] FCAFC 413 ; (2003) AIPC 91-839 , Guylian contends that the proper standard to be applied on an appeal under 35 of the Act in respect of a refusal to register is that the refusal should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the mark should clearly not be registered. Lomas was an appeal from a single judge's decision to uphold an opposition to registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs138" from="[2009] FCA 891">Guylian did not seek to justify in a substantive way the approach of the Full Court in Lomas . It sought to rely on the decision, and those that have followed it, but it acknowledged that other decisions run counter to it. In my view, there is nothing in the relevant provisions that supports the imposition of a higher standard, even at the acceptance stage. The "presumption of registrability" arises from s 33 of the Act: Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 at [24] ; Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 at [50] . Section 33 does not speak of being "clearly satisfied"; it mandates acceptance of an application unless the Registrar " is satisfied that ... there are grounds for rejecting it". On this point, I prefer the views expressed by Gyles J and in particular his Honour's observations that an acceptance that there is a presumption of registrability "says nothing as to the standard of proof" and does not import a higher threshold than the conventional balance of probabilities: see Pfizer [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 at [18] . The presumption as it is gives effect to the general position under the Act that an applicant is not required to establish an absence of grounds to refuse or object to registration. It should also be noted that in both Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 and Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 (both acceptance stage cases) there is no suggestion that any special higher standard was applicable.

<sentence id="cs156" from="[2009] FCA 271">In reply, the respondent has submitted that the principle should not be applied in respect of s 58 on the basis that: the party opposing the registration bears the onus of proof: Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; [2006] 237 ALR 787 ; and where there is conflict between the Pfizer [2006] FCA 1663 ; [2006] 237 ALR 787 and Health World (2008) 75 IPR 478 , Pfizer [2006] FCA 1663 ; [2006] 237 ALR 787 is to be preferred.  The applicant has submitted that there is nothing contradictory or incompatible between the two decisions. I agree. So far as relevant in the context of this case, Gyles J observed in Pfizer [2006] FCA 1663 ; [2006] 237 ALR 787 that: authorities including Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 support the principle that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind, unlike under predecessor legislation whereby the onus was on the applicant to establish registrability (cf Pfizer [2006] FCA 1663 ; [2006] 237 ALR 787 at [7] , [17]); it is well entrenched from the authorities that the presumption of registrability is also to be applied in the setting of opposition to registration (at [8]); in opposition proceedings there is no special onus of proof higher than the standard of proof in normal civil proceedings (at [9], and in considering the operation of s 55 of the Act there is no basis for reading into s 55 the obligation of the opposer to " clearly establish" grounds on which the application is opposed as distinct from the usual civil standard (at [21], [22], [26]).  The principles articulated in Pfizer [2006] FCA 1663 ; [2006] 237 ALR 787 are not in issue in these proceedings. Contrary to the submission of the respondent, I find that there is no inconsistency between these principles and the concept of shift of the evidentiary onus of proof referred to by Jacobson J in Health World [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478. I note in passing that an appeal against the decision of Jacobson J in Health World [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 was recently dismissed by the Full Court ( Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 14) , although the Full Court did not consider the evidentiary issue raised by the respondent in this case. I accept the submission of the applicant that, once the opposer to registration makes a prima facie case, the evidentiary onus as to ownership shifts to the applicant for registration. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs164" from="[2008] ATMO 99">I note this passage indicates an objection based on a family of trade marks may arise under s.44 because of "the known and familiar use of a number of trade marks". Use and reputation is of course not usually considered of direct relevance to a s.44 objection. However, relatively recent cases such as the abovementioned C A Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd (which relevantly, according to the Full Federal Court at [53], concerned infringement under s.120(1) rather than a s.44 matter) and the WOOLWORTHS METRO case cited earlier say that when a trade mark has such notoriety and is of such long standing that consumers generally must be taken to be familiar with its use in relation to particular goods or services then this is a relevant consideration regarding the "surrounding circumstances" and the likelihood of a consumer's imperfect recollection. As the Hearing Officer in McDonald's Corporation v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd put it in a further passage to which Mr Stevens directed me (at paragraph 19): 
I understand and appreciate that it is not appropriate to bring considerations of reputation, per se, into s 44. Ms Champion urged me to adopt the "orthodox" view that "what is to be compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past". Here she relied on the caution of Gyles J in Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663. None the less, if my conclusion is that the ordinary consumer would be misled by the resemblance of the two trade marks --- between either trade mark of the holder on one hand and, on the other, any one of those of the opponent's --- such that there is a significant risk of deception or confusion, s 44 is triggered even though the drivers for this might include the notoriety of the opponent's trade marks. The facts of the present case do not have to be artificially constrained to fit a public perception that exists only in some alternate fantasy world where the opponent is unknown. </sentence>

The appeal proceeding is a hearing conducted "afresh" or de novo on material properly placed before the Court ( Rowntree plc v Rollbits Pty Ltd (1986-1988) 10 IPR 539 per Needham J at 545; Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 at 377; [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 45 IPR 411 422-3 per French J; Pioneer Electric Corporation &amp; Anor v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 17 ALR 43 per Aickin J at 46; Blount Inc. v Registrar of Trade Marks [1998] FCA 440 ; [1998] FCA 440 ; (1998) 83 FCR 50 at 59 per Branson J; Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon (2006) 223 ALR 27 per Lander J at [7]; Pfizer Products Inc. v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2007) 237 ALR 787 per Gyles J at [5]; and Scotch Whiskey Association v De Witt [2008] FCA 73 ; (2008) 75 IPR 280 per Jessop J at [18]). Although the appeal is conducted as a de novo hearing, the scope of the controversy to be resolved in the appeal is determined by the issues framed by the parties. Order 58, r 5(2) requires a party initiating an appeal to identify each ground relied upon to support the orders sought and particulars of each ground. Similarly, by Order 58, r 5A(2) a cross-appellant must state and thus frame the specific grounds relied upon in support of the orders the cross-appellant seeks. In that sense, an appeal from the Registrar's decision is not simply at large. In this case, NVS seeks to vary the decision by agitating the merits of the matters raised by s 44 of the Act.

<sentence id="cs170" from="[2008] ATMO 83">Here the comparison is between an existing trade mark which "had acquired a reputation in Australia" and the opposed marks. The Opponent submits the opposed trade marks are each deceptively similar to the Luxottica mark and that the Luxottica mark had acquired the requisite reputation as at the 13 July 2005 date the opposed applications were filed. As regards the threshold question in paragraph (a) of Section 60, I have already found that neither of the opposed trade marks is deceptively similar to the Luxottica mark in terms of sections 44 and 10 of the Act. That said, unlike the position under section 44, I am able to take the use and reputation of the Opponent's trade marks into account when considering deceptive similarity under section 60. [7]  Ms Bowne noted that to establish this ground there must be some connotation inherent in the opposed marks such that their use would lead to a "real and tangible danger of deception or confusion". In this regard she cited the following words of Gyles, J in Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 (at [53]):

(1) The appeal is in the Court's original jurisdiction.

(2) The opponent bears the onus in the appeal. Whether the onus is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities or (given the presumption that trade marks are registrable) a clear state of satisfaction has generated debate ( Lomas v Winton Shire Council (2003) AIPC 91-839 ; [2002] FCAFC 413 at [36] , Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd (2003) 132 FCR 326 ; [2003] FCA 901 at [16] --- [22], and Pfizer Products Inc v Karam (2006) 237 ALR 787 ; [2006] FCA 1663 at [21] --- [26]). The opponent submitted that the ordinary civil standard of proof should be applied and, absent argument to the contrary, I accede to that submission.

In terms of the onus of proof, it is sufficient that the opponent establishes a ground of opposition on the balance of probabilities (see the Pfizer case ). The holder, in electing not to put on any evidence, to appear, or to respond, renders its application more susceptible to refusal (see Camelot Design Industries Group Pty Limited v Bernard Leser Publications Pty Limited (1987) 9 IPR 596 at 598 and Sportsgirl Pty Limited v Filip Sali (2007) ATMO 71.

The line of thought advanced by Mr. Webb was that the reasoning of Hearing Officer Thompson, and indeed of the applicant, was infused with the assumption that the relevant standard of proof to be applied was high.

At the dates relevant to all the above oppositions, the grounds of opposition under sections 44 and 60 both required the applicant's trade mark to be either substantially identical, or deceptively similar to: (1) A trade mark which is either registered, or for which registration is sought, by a person other than the applicant, that trade mark having an earlier priority date than the applicant's trade mark (in the case of section 44) ; or (2) A trade mark, owned by a person other than the applicant, which had acquired a reputation in Australia before the priority date of the applicant's trade mark (in the case of section 60). </sentence>
