<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCAFC 89">57 It should also be noted that the primary judge accepted, having regard to the authorities, that the common law recognises a privilege against or immunity from spousal incrimination: Stoddart v Boulton [2009] FCA 1108 at [12] applying Callanan v B [2004] QCA 478 ; [2005] 1 Qd R 348 per McPherson JA [18], McMurdo P agreeing at [1] and Jerrard JA at [22] and S v Boulton and Another (supra) per Black CJ at [16] to [28], Jacobson J at [75] to [99] and Greenwood J at [171]. Kiefel J, however, was not satisfied that the common law recognised an immunity from spousal incrimination ( S v Boulton [2005] FCA 821) although as a matter of comity her Honour elected to follow and apply the intermediate Court of Appeal decision in Callanan v B . Dowsett J in Stoten v Sage [2005] FCA 935 ; (2005) 144 FCR 487 similarly doubted a common law immunity from spousal incrimination but elected to apply the decision in Callanan v B . The respondents do not contest in this appeal (and the issue is thus not alive) the conclusions of the primary judge on that matter although the respondents purport to simply "reserve" their position generally on the recognition point so that the question might be put in controversy before the High Court with leave should special leave be sought and obtained. </sentence>
