". some six weeks after the full court's decision (november 1977) the supreme court of new south wales (hutley j.a.) gave judgment which included orders that the applicant had made valid advances to hallad pty ltd up to $770,000, that the applicant as mortgagee had gone into possession of the property, the subject of its security, and remained in possession for some thirteen months until the completion of the sale of that property, that the matter should be referred to the master in equity to inquire what additional sum the applicant would have received from the sale of that property but for the applicant's wilful default, and to inquire also what sums had been reasonably expended by the applicant on improvements etc. while in possession of the subject property.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 315">The Court observes that in that regard it has also had regard to the Supreme Court Proceedings' pleadings, which are in evidence attached to Mr Blyth's 21 April 2011 affidavit. As this Court observed in Secure Parking , and as the Federal Court observed in Lovell v Penkin (a bankrupt) , [8] it is reasonably apparent that an action alleging negligence or breach of contract by a solicitor in relation to litigation or proceedings of the type outlined immediately above, is likely to give rise to issues, especially as to determination of liability and quantum of damages, which are sufficiently complex so as to be more appropriately determined by a court, in this case, the District Court, rather than by way of what would be the less satisfactory, in this case, proof-of-debt process. [9] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 328">Given the importance of s 82(2) , it is perhaps not surprising that the application of that provision (and hence s 58(3)(b)) has not been a matter free of difficulty. Thus, for example, argument has arisen as to whether a claim which is expressed as a claim in tort may nevertheless be characterised as a claim that arises " by reason of a contract " and hence a provable debt: eg, Lovell v Penkin [2008] FCA 637 at [16] to [26] [2008] FCA 637 ; , 101 ALD 335 at 339 to 346 per McKerracher J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 624">The Plaintiffs submitted that the orders sought granting them leave, and the proposed conditions, adopted the form of orders made in Australian Meat Processor Corporation Ltd v O'Connor [2009] FCA 355 and Lovell v Perkin [2008] FCA 637 ; (2008) 101 ALD 335 ; see also Macquarie Bank Ltd v Bardetta (2005) 216 ALR 670 and Allanson v Midland Credit Ltd (1977) 30 FLR 108. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 191">It is reasonably apparent that an action alleging: negligence; misleading or deceptive conduct under s.52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth); and breach of contract, 
by a solicitor, in relation to litigation or proceedings of the type outlined immediately above, is likely to give rise to issues, especially as to determination of liability and quantification of damages, which are sufficiently complex so as to be more appropriately determined by a court (and in this case, the Supreme Court) rather than by way of, what would be, in this case, the "less satisfactory" proof of debt process, [20] and the Court so finds. Law Mutual (WA) does not dispute that view in any event. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FMCA 1264">It is the case that the substance of the proposed proceedings in the Supreme Court would appear to be the professional negligence action in tort. There has been conflicting authority as to whether such an action of itself is in respect of a provable debt. That issue was examined in some detail by McKerracher J in Lovell v Penkin (a bankrupt) and Another (2008) 101 ALD 335; [2008] FCA 637. In that case the proceedings in respect of which leave was sought were proceedings which were in tort only and not in contract, in contrast to the position in this case. However, after considering conflicting authorities, his Honour proceeded on the basis that, as discussed in Allanson v Midland Credit Ltd and Another (1977) 30 FLR 108 at 115; [1977] FCA 14 at [27] "[w] here a court is given power to grant leave to perform a particular act or pursue a particular course of action and the question whether the need for such leave has arisen involves difficult and complicated questions of law or fact, it is permissible, in an appropriate case, to proceed on the basis that such leave is necessary rather than involve the parties in the futile exercise of determining, possibly after a series of appeals, whether the need for such leave has arisen . " His Honour made orders that to the extent that leave was necessary, the applicant in that case had leave to continue proceedings in tort that had been initiated and to take fresh steps in those proceedings.

 The applicants, Peter and Keith Tapp, are brothers.
