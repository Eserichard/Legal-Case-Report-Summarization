30 In another set of reasons for judgment --- Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 3 ) [2008] FCA 1869 at [7] --- the primary judge explained her position as follows:
 &#8226; I found in Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 1) [2008] FCA 1760 that compliance by the first respondent with its undertaking meant a cessation of conduct infringing the applicant's trade mark, and that injunctive relief in terms of that undertaking was appropriate. In my view the alternative wording of the injunction more accurately reflects that undertaking than the applicant's preferred wording of the injunction.</sentence>
