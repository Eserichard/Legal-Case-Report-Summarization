In State of Victoria the Full Federal Court said that "[t]he mere finding that a government has contravened a provision of an anti-discrimination statute without considering the circumstances in which the contravention occurred is not, in our view, sufficient to attract the Briginshaw test". The correct approach in these circumstances was elucidated by Heerey J in Granada Tavern v Smith [2008] FCA 646 ; (2008) 173 IR 328 ; at [95]. His Honour was hearing an appeal against a decision of the Federal Magistrate's Court that an employer had applied duress to an employee in connection with an Australian Workplace Agreement (AWA) contrary to s 400(5) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth):
 
 
 
 In the light of the Full Court's decision in Gama one does not say: "Contravention of s 400(5) is a serious matter; therefore the Briginshaw standard applies". Rather, the fact finder must look at the particular factual allegations. They can vary infinitely. Before reaching a finding which accepts those allegations as true (the onus of course being on the applicant), the fact finder must, amongst other things, take into account the gravity of the particular allegations: s 140(2)(c). </sentence>

The applicant's submissions simply fail to grapple with the vital consideration. I note that while the written submissions of the applicant traverse in some detail the line of authorities stemming from Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336 , those authorities must now be approached more particularly in the light of s.140 of the Evidence Act (see Granada Tavern v Smith [2008] FCA 646 per Heerey J).

" Nonetheless, the assertion advanced in paragraph 54 of the applicant's submissions that: "Unlike the Plaintiffs / Appellants in Jones &amp; Andrews, the husband's financial contributions towards the acquisition and conservation of the Property W property are clearly supported by direct and undisputed documentary evidence although your Honour could not make a conclusive finding on the wife's alleged financial contributions"
