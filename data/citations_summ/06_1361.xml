<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 274">But it should not be thought that that overarching objective and those ends of justice have not been prominently a part of this Court's practice and procedure for many years. In White v Overland [2001] FCA 1333 [4], Allsop J eloquently demonstrated that this is so. I drew on his remarks and those of others in Intel Corporation v Unwired Group Limited [2008] FCA 1927 [63]-[64], to identify that: 
 
 "... the purpose of case management and the docket system adopted by this Court was to enable both the parties and the Court to be informed, from the outset of the case each of the parties intends to advance and to identify the real issues in dispute. This is so that directions can be crafted to enable the efficient management of the litigation, with a view to focusing on and allowing those issues to be tried, and, at the same time, eliminating irrelevant matters quickly and efficiently: White v Overland [2001] FCA 1333 at [3]- [4] per Allsop J (applied by Heydon JA in Nowlan v Marson Transport Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 346 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 116 at 128-129 [28] - [32], Mason P and Young CJ in Eq agreeing); Visible Results Properties Inc v Sushi Train (Australia) Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1159 at [29] per Allsop J; Snowy Mountains Organic Dairy Products Pty Ltd v Wholefoods Pty [2006] FCA 1361 at [15] per myself; Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineering Pty Ltd v Gordian Runoff Ltd [2008] NSWCA 243 at [160] - [162] per Allsop P, with whom Beazley and Campbell JJA agreed.
