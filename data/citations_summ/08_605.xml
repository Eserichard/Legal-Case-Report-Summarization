<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] ATMO 96">As the opponent pointed out in its submissions, the accepted test for substantial identity was outlined by Windeyer, J in Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Aust) Ltd [1963] HCA 66 ; (1961) 109 CLR 407 (' Shell' ). The trade marks in that case were 'device' marks, that is, trade marks without words. There have been very few cases since Shell where the substantial identity of device trade marks has been the subject of judicial consideration [1] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 638">In Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 (" Global Brand "), however, Sundberg J (at [131]) rejected the contention that ownership under s 58 (which states that registration may be opposed on the ground that "the applicant is not the owner of the trade mark") is to be tested as at the date of filing the application. His Honour adopted the analysis of Allsop J in Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd v Q &amp; Q Global Enterprise [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98 who held that where the application was amended to substitute, prior to registration, a new applicant for the original applicant, the new applicant should be regarded as the owner for the purposes of opposition under s 58. Allsop J stated (at [83]) that the new applicant "claimed to be the owner during the registration process. It was an applicant. Section 27(1)(a) was satisfied". Allsop J's reasoning on that issue was approved by the Full Court in Crazy Ron's Communications Pty Ltd v Q &amp; Q Global Enterprises [2004] FCAFC 196 ; (2004) 61 IPR 212 (" Crazy Ron's "), although his decision was set aside. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCAFC 58">
 

58 Her Honour recognised that this will not necessarily always be so:
 
 
 [31] ... s 58 does not confine opposition to registration of a trade mark to a party itself claiming ownership of that trade mark. Examples of cases in which claims --- albeit unsuccessful --- were made by a third party against the registered owner of a trade mark pursuant to s 58 are Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 and Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd v Q &amp; Q Global Enterprise [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98. Indeed in this case the respondent has not disputed the standing of the applicant to oppose registration of trade mark 967804 on the ground of s 58. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 291">From these submissions and the various authorities I was referred to by counsel, I take the relevant legal principles on this infringement issue to be as follows: 
(a) Use as a trade mark is use of the mark as a "badge of origin" in the sense that it indicates a connection in the course of trade between goods or services and the person who applies the mark to those goods or services. It has been described as "planting a flag to identify the fact you are in a particular trader's territory": see Johnson &amp; Johnson Australia Pty Limited v Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Limited [1991] FCA 310 ; (1991) 30 FCR 326 (" Johnson &amp; Johnson ") at 342 per Burchett J and 347 per Gummow J, Coca Cola at [19] and Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 (" Global Brand ") at [45] per Sundberg J;
 
(b) In determining whether a sign is used as a trade mark, one does not ask whether the sign indicates a connection between the alleged infringer's services and those of the registered owner. Instead, one asks whether the alleged infringer has used the sign so as to indicate that the origin of the services was in itself: see Coca Cola at [20] and [28] and Global Brand at [47];
 
(c) The latter question is the question that has to be determined at this threshold stage: see Coca Cola at [30]. The determination of this threshold question only involves an examination of the impugned mark, not the registered trade mark: Global Brand at [49];
 
(d) In assessing whether the alleged use is use as a trade mark, the Court is required to examine the purpose and nature of the use in its context.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 1437">A " trade mark " is defined by s 17 of the Trade Marks Act as being: 
 
 ... a sign used, or intended to be used, to distinguish goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other person. 
 

 
Registration of a trade mark confers " exclusive rights ". Section 20(1) provides as follows:
 
 
 If a trade mark is registered, the registered owner of the trade mark has, subject to this Part, the exclusive rights: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) to use the trade mark; and 
 (b) to authorise other persons to use the trade mark; 
 
 
 
 
 in relation to the goods and/or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. 
 

 
The function of a trade mark is " to give an indication to the purchaser or possible purchaser as to the manufacture or quality of the goods --- to give an indication to his eye of the trade source from which the goods come, or the trade hands through which they pass on their way to the market ": In re Powell's Trade-Mark [1893] 2 Ch 388 at 403 to 404 per Bowen LJ. Use " as a trade mark " in s 120(1) is use of the mark as a " badge of origin " in the sense that it indicates a connection in the course of trade between goods and the person who applies the mark to the goods: Coca-Cola Co v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 at [19] , [1999] FCA 1721 ; 96 FCR 107 at 115 per Black CJ, Sundberg and Finkelstein JJ; Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 605 at [45] , [2008] FCA 605 ; 76 IPR 161 at 171 per Sundberg J; E &amp; J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 934 at [19] , [2008] FCA 934 ; [2008] FCA 934 ; 77 IPR 69 at 73 to 74.

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] FCA 271">Whether the act of making an application to register a trade mark in the name of a party other than the owner is a fatal defect in that application was given some consideration in Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98 and Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161. The decision in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 was delivered after my judgment in this case was reserved. The Court in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; 2008) 76 IPR 161 also considered the decision in Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98.  As has been observed elsewhere, s 58 is conventionally used as a ground of opposition where disputing parties have had a business or contractual relationship, and are in dispute as to which of those parties is the true owner of the mark ( Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (4th ed, Lawbook Co, 2008) p 380, cf Elkington B, Hall M, Kell D, Trade Mark Law in Australia (Butterworths, 2000) p 77). However s 58 does not confine opposition to registration of a trade mark to a party itself claiming ownership of that trade mark. Examples of cases in which claims --- albeit unsuccessful --- were made by a third party against the registered owner of a trade mark pursuant to s 58 are Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 and Mobileworld Communications Pty Ltd v Q &amp; Q Global Enterprise [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98. Indeed in this case the respondent has not disputed the standing of the applicant to oppose registration of trade mark 967804 on the ground of s 58. I shall return to these cases later in this judgment. Onus

The decision in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 was delivered after my judgment in this case was reserved.

The trial judge in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 referred to Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98 where the trial judge had noted the innocent error in registering the wrong applicant. Further, in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 the trial judge was satisfied that the company to which the application for registration was eventually assigned was the owner of the trade mark in question (at [135]-[136]).  Both Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98 and Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 are distinguishable from this case because in both cases the ownership position was clear. In contrast, I do not accept that the Act sanctions a position in which an application can be made where ownership of a trade mark is not capable of identification during the application process, and a finding cannot be made that the applicant was the owner, as is the case in these proceedings.  The trial judge in Global Brand Marketing [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161 referred to Mobileworld Communications [2003] FCA 1404 ; (2003) 61 IPR 98 where the trial judge had noted the innocent error in registering the wrong applicant.

 61 The principles relevant to use of shape as a trade mark are now set out. 
 
 
 
 
 (a) A special shape which is the whole or part of goods may serve as a badge of origin. However the shape must have a feature that is "extra" and distinct from the inherent form of the particular goods: Mayne at [67], Remington at [16] and Kenman Kandy at [137].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1805">18 The parties agreed that, in proceedings such as this, the Court would ordinarily order that the unsuccessful party or parties pay the costs of successful party or parties on the claim and cross-claim respectively: see, e.g., Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 605 ; (2008) 76 IPR 161. Thus, ordinarily, the applicants would pay Redberry's costs of the application and Redberry would pay the cross-respondents' costs of the cross-claim. In this case, however, the position is complicated by Redberry's offers of settlement. </sentence>

 ... a sign used, or intended to be used, to distinguish goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other person.
