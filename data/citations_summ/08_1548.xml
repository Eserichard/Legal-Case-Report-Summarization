<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] VSCA 111">20 The obvious difficulty with treating reasonableness in this way --- that is, as a condition of the valid exercise of a statutory power --- is that when the validity of a particular exercise of power is challenged (whether directly or collaterally), the court must undertake what amounts to a review on the merits of the exercise of power. The present case illustrates the point. Instead of being confined to deciding whether the exercise of power under s 55(1) fell outside the limits of validity defined by Wednesbury unreasonableness, the court would be required to decide for itself, on the merits of the case, whether it was reasonable for the police officer to impose the particular requirement on the particular driver in the particular circumstances of the case. That, in my view, is a task for a tribunal undertaking merits review, not for a court considering legal validity. [17] </sentence>
