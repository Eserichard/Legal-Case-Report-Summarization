<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 996">The challenged pleading is to be read as a whole. The Court accepts that a cause of action can be sufficiently pleaded at different levels of generality depending on the nature of the case and the subject matter and most pleadings set forth the material facts at a level which involves some element of conclusion. In cases involving collusion direct evidence will rarely be available and proof generally rests on inference deduced from acts done in pursuance of the apparent common purpose: Adsteam Building Industries P/L v Queensland Cement and Lime Co (No 4) (1984) 14 ACLR 456 and ACCC v April International Marketing Services Australia P/L [2007] FCA 2024. The Court at first instance should be careful not to risk stifling the development of the law by summarily rejecting a claim where there is a reasonable possibility that, as the law develops, it will be found that a cause of action may lie: Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia v Hunt (1983) 44 ALR 365 at 373.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCAFC 85">10 His Honour then referred to the argument of the applicant. He noted that the applicant's counsel conceded that this part of its case is pleaded "at a level of generality" but contended that "the best available particulars have been provided and the core allegations are clear". Counsel for the applicant called in aid the decision of Bennett J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v April Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2024. </sentence>

After considering these comments, Hely J in Australian Wool Innovation Ltd v Newkirk [2005] FCA 290 at [22] , [2005] FCA 290 ; (2005) ATPR 42-053 at 42,669, again cautioned that " even this more flexible view of pleading does not countenance the omission of material facts from the statement of claim regarded as a whole ". His Honour went on to conclude that " if the pleading regarded as a whole does not contain a clear statement of all the material facts on which the applicant relies, it is no answer that the respondent can request the provision of further particulars ". See also: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v April International Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2024 at [41] , [2007] FCA 2024 ; (2007) ATPR 42-210 per Bennett J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 1317">Counsel for the applicant conceded that this part of the applicant's case is pleaded "at a level of generality" but contended that "the best available particulars have been provided and the core allegations are clear". Reliance was placed on the decision of Bennett J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v April Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2024 which was said to be "an analogous ACCC cartel claim. " I am not persuaded that the pleadings with which her Honour was concerned in April Marketing were analogous (except perhaps in a very broad sense) with those in the present case. Nonetheless Bennett J's reasons, especially at [48] and [49], do emphasise the need for applicants to be accorded some leeway in pleading cartel cases. She was prepared to allow the applicant to plead conclusions and defer the provision of particulars until after discovery. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 735">The Commission relies on s 6 of the Trade Practices Act to extend the operation of s 45 to natural persons if their conduct relates to trade with Australia. This would make the liability of the individual respondents direct and not ancillary to that of the corporate respondents. There was some discussion of the availability of that section in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v April International Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2024 ; (2007) ATPR 42-210. </sentence>
