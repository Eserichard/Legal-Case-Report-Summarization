<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 48">Similarly, in City of Swan v Lehman Bros Australia Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 1190 (at [13]), Rares J concluded that under s 1337S(1)(c) CA, the Court's rule making powers under s 59 FCA were extended 'without limitation, with respect to costs'. It followed that the width of the costs powers in s 1337S(1)(c) CA could extend to non-parties despite the word 'parties' in s 1335(2) CA. </sentence>
