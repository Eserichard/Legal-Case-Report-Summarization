 IAN DUNCAN 
Applicant

 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CENTRELINK 
Respondent
 
 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Appeal 
 The applicant, Mr Duncan, has appealed a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by Senior Member 
Mr S Penglis given on 15 December 2006 in which the Tribunal affirmed the reviewable decision in W2002/409 [1] . The Appeal was filed under s.44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). [2] The Appeal is the latest in a long line of litigation involving 
Mr Duncan and Centrelink. [3] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1450">7 The only argument that the applicant made in response to the above points which were put by the respondents was to refer to the decision of Finn J in Duncan v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2008] FCA 56. His Honour, at [32], made observations referring to Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437 concerning the Court's discretionary power to make declarations and the undesirability of that power being fettered. His Honour recognised, however, that "its exercise is confined by the considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power" which, in this case are to be found in s 16. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 667">When delivering judgment in the principal proceeding in which I dismissed Mr Duncan's application: see Duncan v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2008] FCA 56 ; (2008) 100 ALD 292 ; I ventured to suggest that this may be an appropriate matter in which to make no order as to costs. Nonetheless I invited submissions on costs. Needless to say each party sought a costs order. Mr Duncan relies upon what he contends was Centrelink's demonstrated "disdain for the law" although, as the costs of his pro bono counsel are not being sought, any costs order in his favour would in any event be limited to out-of-pocket expenses: see Cachia v Hanes [1994] HCA 14 ; (1994) 179 CLR 403 ; and see generally Dal Pont, Law of Costs (2003) [7.24] ff. Centrelink's claimed entitlement to a costs award was founded upon the principle that, ordinarily, costs follow the event. It contends that it did not unreasonably provoke the litigation: cf Cummings v Lewis (unreported, Wilcox J, 29 May 1992); the defensive postures it took, though unsuccessful in some degree, were not unreasonable: Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 81 ALR 166 at 169; and the applicant was wholly unsuccessful. </sentence>
