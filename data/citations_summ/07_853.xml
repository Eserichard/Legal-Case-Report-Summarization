<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] NSWIRComm 158">27 Ms Anderson referred to the history of how the provision had been applied and accepted by the respondent for almost 30 years. The appellant had only paid the minimum four-hour recall where a firefighter had gone home after being called in, and not where the ordinary shift followed immediately thereafter. She said that the appellant's approach had been with the full knowledge, acquiescence and, indeed, at the request of the respondent: see United Firefighters' Union of Australia v Country Fire Authority [2007] FCA 853. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCAFC 169">1 The appellant brought a proceeding in this Court for the imposition of penalties for breaches of the Victorian Firefighting Industry Employees Interim Award 2000 ("the Award") and the Country Fire Authority/United Firefighters Union of Australia Operational Staff Enterprise Agreement 2002 ("the Certified Agreement") (both of which were made pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth)). Declarations as to the correct interpretation of some provisions of the Award and the Certified Agreement were also sought. The appellant's claims were rejected ( United Firefighters' Union of Australia v Country Fire Authority [2007] FCA 853). The factual background to the legal issues raised by the appeal and, in particular, the circumstances relating to the second respondent's employment and appointment as a "Leading Firefighter" are set out in the judgment under appeal and it is not necessary to repeat them here.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 957">40 In this context, REX's reliance upon two further decisions was misplaced. In United Firefighters' Union of Australia v Country Fire Authority [2007] FCA 853 esp at [32], the Court considered the effect of an act done in breach of particular clauses of the relevant award and the relevant certified agreement. As I have said, this appeal was not concerned with an act done in breach of the Certified Agreement. The issue considered by Gray J did not arise in these proceedings. </sentence>
