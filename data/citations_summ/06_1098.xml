<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 102">However, s 411(12) provides that:
 
'The Court may, by order, exempt a body from compliance with subsection (11), or determine the period during which the body must comply with that subsection. '
 
 [36] In Re Equinox Resources Ltd [2004] WASC 143 ; (2004) 49 ACSR 692 , EM Heenan J at [22] indicated that the purpose of section 411(11) was:
 
'... to ensure that any modification of the rights of shareholders of the company which is the subject of the scheme, or any other provision in the scheme which may affect the interests of persons dealing with the company, such as prospective creditors or purchasers of shares, will be sure to have the opportunity of seeing what the exact rights of shareholders in the company or of its creditors are, as modified, if at all, by the scheme which has been approved. '
 
 [37] His Honour there held that where the proposed scheme would not involved modification of any rights of shareholders, creditors, or of other persons dealing with the company, it would be an appropriate case for dispensation from the requirement to comply with s 411(11): see also Re Rocksoft Ltd [2006] FCA 1098 at [16] . [38] Upon implementation of the Scheme (as approved by the Court), Broadcast Australia will be the sole shareholder of Hostworks. The Scheme will not have involved modification to the rights of shareholders' or of creditors' entitlements, but simply involve a change in the shareholding of Hostworks and a cancellation of the options in Hostworks on issue at the time the Scheme was proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSC 100">[14] The plaintiffs contend that an exemption from compliance with s 411(11) is appropriate given that: 
 upon implementation of the schemes, the plaintiffs will become wholly owned subsidiaries of Metcash, through it's subsidiary Metcash Trading; and current shareholders are fully informed about the schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 248">

33 Hostworks seeks an order that the Scheme be approved subject to an alteration to the method of payment of the Scheme consideration so as to allow the payment to be made by electronic funds transfer into the nominated bank account of members, and to provide a mechanism by which members of Hostworks who previously had authorised Hostworks to deposit dividends into their nominated account to "opt out" and receive the Scheme consideration by bank cheque. That proposed alteration to the Scheme was identified by the chairman at the Scheme meeting. A variation of a shareholder approved scheme in similar terms was made in Re Rocksoft Ltd [2006] FCA 1098 , as the proposed variation involved simply a commercial consideration which had no novelty or significance to the nature of the scheme or to the members.  

37 His Honour there held that where the proposed scheme would not involved modification of any rights of shareholders, creditors, or of other persons dealing with the company, it would be an appropriate case for dispensation from the requirement to comply with s 411(11): see also Re Rocksoft Ltd [2006] FCA 1098 at [16] .</sentence>
