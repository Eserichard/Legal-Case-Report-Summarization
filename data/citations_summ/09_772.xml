<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 1">In any event, were either of the defendants' arguments about procedural irregularities in the calling of the 13 March 1999 meeting to have been upheld then, upon an application of Corporations Act , s 1322 , resolution 12 would not be invalidated because of this procedural irregularity. I am of the opinion that any such irregularity neither caused nor is likely cause of "substantial injustice". I would not have been prepared to declare Motion 12 to be invalid. Corporations Act , s 1322 applies. The Corporations Law applicable in March 1999 included an identical provision: Corporations Law, s 1322. A "procedural irregularity" in this section includes a reference to the absence of a quorum in a meeting and a defect, irregularity or deficiency of notice of time: Corporations Act , s 1322(1). Corporations Act , s 1322(2) provides:- 
 
 
 "A proceeding under this Act is not invalidated because of any procedural irregularity unless the Court is of the opinion that the irregularity has caused or may cause substantial injustice that cannot be remedied by any order by the Court and by order declares the proceedings to be invalid. " 
 

The steps taken by the members present to successfully adjourn the meeting were "a proceeding under this Act": Re Broadway Motors Holdings Pty Limited (in liquidation) (1986) 6 NSWLR 45 at 56 and City Pacific Limited v Bacon (No 2) [2009] FCA 772 at 51; (2009) 178 FCR 81. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 11">Finally, it is necessary to consider the words " interest in the resolution ... other than as a member ". In City Pacific Limited v Bacon (No 2) [2009] FCA 772 , Dowsett J observed (at [28]) that s 253E of the Act " seems to assume that a responsible entity of a listed scheme will have an interest in both its removal and its replacement ". In Southern Wine , Steytler P (with whom McLure and Pullin JJA agreed) reviewed the legislative history and context of s 253E and observed it " ... was designed to ensure that the responsible entity, in voting on a resolution, would not put its own interest, arising independently of its membership of the scheme, ahead of that of other members, to their potential detriment ": at [21]. </sentence>
