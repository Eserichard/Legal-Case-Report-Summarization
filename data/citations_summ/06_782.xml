<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] ATMO 106">However, I am also satisfied that the amount of adaptation to distinguish is slight, and quoting Justice Kenny again (paragraph 110): 
Since the trade mark ... has a relatively low level of inherent adaptation to distinguish compared to many other marks, it will require a correspondingly higher level of use and other circumstances to satisfy the Court that it does or will distinguish the designated services see Chocolaterie Guylian at 88 [83]; Unilever Australia Ltd v Societe Des Produits Nestl&eacute; SA [2006] FCA 782 ; (2006) 154 FCR 165 at 177 [57] (Bennett J); Time Warner Entertainment Co LP v Stepsam Investments Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1502 ; (2003) 134 FCR 51 at 59-60 [42] (Wilcox J); also Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (Mark Davison, Tracey Berger and Annette Freeman; 4th edition; Lawbook Co; Sydney; 2008) (' Shanahan's ') at [25.650]. The less the mark is inherently adapted to distinguish, the more the actual use of the mark (or other circumstances) will be required to satisfy the Court that the trade mark does or will distinguish the designated services. ... The evidence of use must be for the trade mark that is the subject of the trade mark application : Shanahan's at [25.655] and Woolworths Ltd v BP Plc at 126-7 [121]-[123] (in relation to s 41(6)).

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 664">Since the trade mark TENNIS WAREHOUSE has a relatively low level of inherent adaptation to distinguish compared to many other marks, it will require a correspondingly higher level of use and other circumstances to satisfy the Court that it does or will distinguish the designated services: see Chocolaterie Guylian at 88 [83]; Unilever Australia Ltd v Societe Des Produits Nestl&eacute; SA [2006] FCA 782 ; (2006) 154 FCR 165 at 177 [57] (Bennett J); Time Warner Entertainment Co LP v Stepsam Investments Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1502 ; (2003) 134 FCR 51 at 59-60 [42] (Wilcox J); also Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (Mark Davison, Tracey Berger and Annette Freeman; 4 th edition; Lawbook Co; Sydney; 2008) (' Shanahan's ') at [25.650]. The less the mark is inherently adapted to distinguish, the more the actual use of the mark (or other circumstances) will be required to satisfy the Court that the trade mark does or will distinguish the designated services. Further, according to Shanahan's , where there are many other ways of describing the relevant services, the descriptiveness of the trade mark may be less significant than where the trade mark is close to being "a sign that is ordinarily used to indicate a characteristic of the goods": see Shanahan's at [25.650], quoting Kamyr Inc's Application (1996) 34 IPR 432 (Reg) ; also Austereo at 266 [38]. The evidence of use must be for the trade mark that is the subject of the trade mark application: Shanahan's at [25.655] and Woolworths Ltd v BP Plc at 126-7 [121]-[123] (in relation to s 41(6)). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 891">Section 41(5) permits the registration of trade marks that are not, by their inherent qualities, sufficiently adapted to distinguish, but which have as at the priority date in fact acquired a capability to distinguish the relevant goods: see Austereo [2004] FCA 968 ; 61 IPR 257 ; see also Clark 111 CLR at 515; British Sugar [1996] RPC 281 at 306; Nestle [2006] FCA 782 ; 154 FCR 165 at [29] . In other words, s 41(5) recognises that marks which are insufficiently inherently adapted to distinguish may nevertheless by their use have become distinctive in the minds of consumers so that they will be able to "do the job of distinguishing" the applicant's goods, that is, they will in fact serve as a badge or an indicator of origin. Accordingly, under s 41(5) an applicant relying on use prior to the priority date will need to point to evidence that the mark has been used as a trade mark , so as to have acquired the requisite capability to distinguish the applicant's goods: see, in the context of s 41(6), Woolworths Ltd v BP Plc (No 2) [2006] FCAFC 132 ; (2006) 154 FCR 97 at [72] and [77] ( BP (No 2) ); Ocean Spray [2000] FCA 177 ; 47 IPR 579 at [38] - [41], in particular [40]. Guylian's submissions
  As I consider the shape is to some extent inherently adapted to distinguish, then s 41(5) is applicable. Section 41(5) involves a balancing exercise. With a view to deciding whether the mark does or will distinguish the goods as being Guylian's, the Court is required to consider, in combination, two specific matters: (1) the extent to which the mark is inherently adapted to distinguish, and (2) the use, or intended use, of the mark by Guylian (cf. Kitto J's approach in Clark 111 CLR at 513). The Registrar, and on this appeal the Court, must be "satisfied" that the mark does or will distinguish the goods as being Guylian's: pars 41(5)(b) and (c). It is a balancing exercise in that, for example, a mark that is inherently adapted only to a small degree is thereby likely to require greater evidence that it has been (or will be) used in such a way as to distinguish the relevant goods: see, eg, the approaches of Bennett J in Unilever Australia Ltd v Societe Des Produits Nestl&eacute; SA [2006] FCA 782 ; (2006) 154 FCR 165 ( Nestle ) at [57] and Wilcox J in Time Warner Entertainment Company LP v Stepsam Investments Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1502 ; (2003) 134 FCR 51 at [42] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] ATMO 51">Concerning the inherent adaptation of the trade mark to distinguish the applicant's goods from the goods of other traders, Mr Brewis, for the applicant stated: 
In the GO ON case Unilever Australia Ltd v Societe Des Produits Nestle S.A. , [2006] FCA 782 , the Court commented as follows :
 
There are numerous examples of phrases and exhortations that can obtain distinctiveness. No different test is applied in assessing slogans as trade marks or in determining their inherent capacity to distinguish. And further, from the same case:-
 
The increasing use of slogans in advertising and their use by traders as trade marks ..... has led to the use of multiple trade marks, with distinctiveness being acquired by a slogan by use with another strong trade mark. The use of a slogan in conjunction with a registered mark may lead, in time, to recognition by the public that separate use designates the origin of a product and distinguishes it from other products. There is no evidence to the effect that the mark is not capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods --- the opponent's pointing to instances of use of components of the mark being used in a descriptive manner is not sufficient to discharge this onus. There is no evidence to the effect that other traders in similar goods would, without any improper motive, be likely to think of the mark and wish to use it in relation to their similar goods. Exhibit B to the Marshall declaration does not refer to a single instance of use of the mark by any other party
