<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1593">Under the heading Costs, I said in my reasons for judgment of 11 December 2009 (see HP Mercantile Pty Ltd v Crouch; in the matter of Tumut River Orchard Management Ltd (In Liquidation) ACN 003 501 511 [2009] FCA 1492 at [78-81] :- 
 
 '78. The second, third and fourth applicants propounded that each of the examination summons should be discharged and in this regard they have failed to make good their case as recorded in the Further Amended Interlocutory Process filed 30 November 2009. However, in relation to their alternative prayers for relief seeking the striking out of requirements for the production of documents, they have been substantially successful both in respect of the original formulation of the relevant requirement and the later formulations as well. 
 

 In my opinion the appropriate order as to costs would be one under which the plaintiff/respondent, Mr Crouch, was required to pay one quarter of the second, third and fourth applicants' costs. 
 Whilst it could be said that each party has enjoyed a measure of success and accordingly there should be no order as to costs, the fact is that the plaintiff/respondent did not propound an appropriate requirement for the production of documents, notwithstanding two opportunities to address the significant deficiencies in the original formulation of the document production requirements. 
 To avoid the necessity of further costs being incurred what I propose to do is to make an order in the terms which I have proposed, but I will direct that such order not be entered for a period of seven days to allow either party to make an application seeking a different order in relation to costs.
