<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 54">The first is oppression and the second is via a claim for breach of directors' duties. It is submitted that if the register is rectified nunc pro tunc , such that Elif is back in control of MSU Management, then she has standing to seek a remedy in its name (Mr Jacobs referring to Winspear v Mackinnon [2007] FCA 2077 para [54], where Marshall J noted Counsel's concession that if the rectification order was made nunc pro tunc , (finding the plaintiff to be entitled retrospectively to be a member of the company at the time the application was filed) then the standing issue - there, in relation to an oppression suit - disappeared. No similar concession was made by Mr Cox. ) 
 Oppression
