<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 283">However, as set out above, neither victimisation under the SDA nor any breach of the RDA has been established. Some, but not all of the alleged conduct within s.28B(2) of the SDA has been made out. The claim for damages must be seen in light of these findings. Relevantly, in proceedings commenced under s.46PO of the AHRC Act Cowdroy J stated in New South Wales Department of Housing v Moskalev and Another (2007) 158 FCR 206 ; [2007] FCA 353 at ([34]) that " In the absence of any finding of unlawful conduct by [the respondent] there [i] s no jurisdiction under s 15 of the FMA which [can] support the order " sought under the applicable legislation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 644">At times, temporary accommodation must be found pending the availability of suitable permanent accommodation. There are bound to be significant limitations in the suitability of temporary accommodation. This Court does not have any general jurisdiction to deal with perceived administrative shortcomings in the provision of public housing in New South Wales [1] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 773">In Welsh this Court dealt with the associated matter jurisdiction of this Court, observing that: matters are associated if there is a common substratum of fact between the original matter within jurisdiction and the associated matter, and, if that is so, the associated jurisdiction of this Court may be invoked; [27] the nature of the associated jurisdiction of this Court was dealt with by the Federal Court in New South Wales Department of Housing v Moskalev . [28] In Moskalev , the Federal Court set out the law concerning this Court's associated jurisdiction as follows: "In Philip Morris Incorporated and Another v Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited; United States Surgical Corporation v Hospital Products International Proprietary Limited and Others (1981) 148 CLR 457 at 474, Barwick CJ said of the application of s.32 of the Federal Court Act: 'Thus, there may be circumstances in which the matter does not in substance itself attract federal jurisdiction, though that which attracts federal jurisdiction must in some way relate to the matter. Once federal jurisdiction is attracted, it is not lost because the claim or assertion which attracted it has not been substantiated or has been displaced by some countervailing fact. Once attracted, by whatever path attracted, the jurisdiction persists to enable the Court to resolve the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 281">The nature of the associated jurisdiction of the Court was dealt with by the Federal Court in New South Wales Department of Housing v Moskalev . [13] At first instance in this Court an application under s.46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) claiming discrimination in the provision of accommodation was dismissed, but notwithstanding the dismissal, the Court ordered the Department of Housing to reassess eligibility for priority housing under the Department of Housing Priority Housing Philosophy. The issue for the Federal Court was whether this Court's order for reassessment of priority was beyond power. [14] Ultimately, the answer to the issue depended upon whether the ability to make the order sought to be impugned was within this Court's associated jurisdiction under s.18 of the FM Act . [15] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FMCA 474">Whether or not a matter is within the associated jurisdiction of the Court was recently dealt with by the Federal Court in New South Wales Department of Housing v Moskalev . [70] At first instance in this Court an application under s.46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Act 1986 (Cth) claiming discrimination in the provision of accommodation was dismissed, but notwithstanding the dismissal, the Court ordered the Department of Housing to reassess eligibility for priority housing under the Department of Housing Priority Housing Philosophy. The issue for the Federal Court was whether this Court's order for reassessment of priority was beyond power. [71] Ultimately, the answer to the issue depended upon whether the ability to make the order sought to be impugned was within this Court's associated jurisdiction under s.18 of the FM Act . [72] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 488">In relation to the claim in the Court's associated or accrued jurisdiction, the Federal Court has provided guidance in New South Wales Department of Housing v Moskalev [2007] FCA 353 at [17] - [34].</sentence>
