<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 600">The history of this matter, and another related matter, are described in the judgment of Finn J in Futuris Corporation Limited (ACN 004 336 636) v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1096 relevantly at [2]-[10]. I respectfully adopt his Honour's description. I do not need to refer to those background facts further. For present purposes, it is sufficient to set out the pleadings and subsequent correspondence giving rise to the present application for particulars.  The applicant submitted that, in most circumstances, it is unlikely that an issue will arise as to the alternative postulate, but submitted that the present circumstances are different because they involve a factually complicated arrangement leading up to the ultimate sale of the entity called Walshville, as described by Finn J in Futuris Corporation Limited (ACN 004 336 636) v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1096 referred to above. </sentence>
