<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1201">28 In that context, it is considered that the discretion to allow an applicant to inspect seized documents may be exercised to permit:
 
(a) an assessment to be made as to whether or not there has been compliance with the order as made and (possibly) whether any further order pursuant to O 25B may be warranted; 
 
(b) the identification and separation from the entirety of those documents that were in fact seized, those documents which do or may provide evidence pending the hearing and determination of a proceeding; and
 
(c) the identification and separation from the entirety of those documents that were in fact seized, those documents which do not provide such evidence so that those documents may be returned. And, in identifying those documents which should be preserved pending the final hearing and determination of a proceeding:
 
(d) the search is not limited to those documents directly related to the precise cause of action then known: cf Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 862 at [6] ---[7] per Allsop J; Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1707 at [4] per Jacobson J. There may well be other reasons for granting leave to an applicant to inspect seized documents. All of the purposes identified, however, have one thing in common -- they allow the documents which have been seized to be inspected in order to ensure that the search order has been complied with and to ensure that only evidence which should be preserved is in fact preserved pending the final determination of a proceeding. </sentence>
