<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 976">Those consequences do not, however, render s 60 inapplicable. A demand under s 60 is not an imposition of excise duty or a substitute for excise duty but rather a liability that is collateral to a liability for excise duty: Southern Shipping [1962] HCA 20 ; 107 CLR 279 at 288 per Dixon J. As Sundberg J said in Caltex [2008] FCA 1951 ; 173 FCR 359 at [155] : 
 
 
 ... it is not correct to say that s 60 has no application in respect of goods over which the Commissioner's control has come to an end. The section applies where (1) a person has or has had possession of excisable goods, (2) the goods are subject to the Commissioner's control (i.e. have not been delivered) and (3) there is a failure to keep them safely or a failure to account for them. It seems to me that the requirement (2) for the goods to be subject to control is concerned with and referable to the period during which they are in the possession of the relevant person rather than the time at which the Commissioner relies on the section. The very thing the section is concerned with is the loss of goods (for example, their disappearance without adequate explanation) or the movement of goods into home consumption while subject to control and without the payment of duty. Section 60 it seems to me has no less an application to excisable goods that have ceased to be subject to control, where the cessation of that control is a result of the manufacturer delivering the goods into home consumption in an unauthorised manner. 
 
 

  As the Commissioner submitted, s 61D(12) is a "regulatory and mechanical provision designed to ensure proper compliance by a proprietor with its responsibilities for the export of excisable goods". Once the goods are deemed to have been entered and delivered for home consumption by virtue of s 61D(12) , two consequences flow: s 61D has "no further role to play by itself in terms of imposing any excise or other liability". It does not impose any excise. Other provisions in the Excise Act are necessary for that to occur and, in particular, s 60 of the Excise Act . That is what occurred in the present appeal; and the deemed delivery of goods into home consumption ex facie brings the Commissioner's control to an end, pursuant to s 61(1) of the Excise Act : Collector of Customs (NSW) v Southern Shipping Co Ltd [1962] HCA 20 ; (1962) 107 CLR 279 and Caltex Australia Petroleum Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1951 ; (2008) 173 FCR 359. </sentence>
