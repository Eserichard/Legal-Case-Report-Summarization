<citphrase id="cp7.12" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 487">where a union member alleged improper uses of powers and resources by union officers in respect of the publication and distribution of union election material critical of a group within the union of which he was a member, he bore the onus of proving such claims (and had failed to do so). the court could not draw inferences to make up for lack of evidence to support his claims.  (2) whilst it is a principle of law that union officers shall not expend union resources to promote or support one group of candidates against another during the conduct of an election such a rule applies during a period which commences when the returning officer calls for nominations and ends at the latest with the declaration of the ballot. the applicant had failed to show that the respondents had contravened this principle during the relevant period.  (3) where union officials were empowered to use resources of the union to communicate with the membership the publication of a pamphlet seemingly critical of a group within the union could not in itself be probative of a lack of bona fides on the part of those officials, who were, as a principle of law obliged to exercise their powers in good faith. it was for them to determine what matters of interest should be communicated to the members.  (4) per keely j., dissenting</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp7.13" type=cited from="[1985] FCA 487">it was open to the court to draw the inference from the evidence that the respondents had used their powers and union resources to publish material directed at influencing the membership to vote against the group to which the applicant belonged. it would be unreal and artificial to limit the period of operation of the principle prohibiting such conduct to the time after the formal calling for nominations.  scott v. jess [1984] fca 289 ; (1984) 3 fcr 263 ; bradshaw v. mcewans pty ltd 1951, unreported, cited in luxton v. vines [1952] hca 19 ; (1952) 85 clr 352 ; tozer kemsley &amp; millbourn (a'asia) pty ltd v. collier's interstate transport services ltd [1956] hca 6 ; (1956) 94 clr 384 ; kanan v. hawkins (1978) 8 ir 371 ; williams v. hursey [1959] hca 51 ; (1959) 103 clr 30 ; short v. wellings (1951) 72 car 84; holmes v. riordan (1955) 86 car 180; re australian postal and telecommunications union; ex parte wilson [1979] fca 107 ; (1979) 28 alr 330 ; valentine v. butcher [1981] fca 30 ; (1981) 51 flr 127 ; bull v. attorney-general for new south wales [1913] hca 60 ; (1913) 17 clr 370 , referred to.  hearing  melbourne, 1985, june 17-19; december 20. 20:12:1985</citphrase>

 And, again, the same reservation is appropriate when an application is made pursuant to s 200 of the 2009 Act and when an inquiry is conducted pursuant to s 201: Re McJannett (No 2) [2009] FCA 1015 at [102] per Barker J. 
 

 
 
 [25] Although it may be accepted that the holding of an inquiry is " a serious matter ", it has also been said that the statutory precondition to the holding of such an inquiry has been set by the legislature at a " low " level: Bourne v Campbell [1999] FCA 1522 at [8] , (1999) 93 IR 238 at 240. Einfeld J there observed: 
 

 
 
 
 [8] When this application was first listed for directions, the Court was not invited by the respondents to determine that there was, as raised by s 219, no reasonable ground for the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 1311">It was to remedy the defects in the definition of " irregularity " considered in Re Collins that s 190 was apparently introduced: Re Mcjannett (No 2) [2009] FCA 1015 at [23] to [24]. Barker J there noted that s 190 was introduced for the first time as part of Sch 1 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) and did not exist under earlier legislation dealing with inquiries into irregularities.  Notwithstanding the manner in which the Application to this Court is expressed, it is considered that the law to be applied is that now contained in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (Cth) ("the 2009 Act"). That was the conclusion reached by Barker J after a review of the complex transitional provisions in Re Mcjannett (No 2) [2009] FCA 1015 at [3] to [10].  In such circumstances, the proper inference is that the Parliament intended that electoral inquiries should not be lightly embarked upon nor extended unnecessarily beyond the subject matter of the particular application. That is the scheme of Pt IX Div 5 of the Act. The provision of s 221(1)(c) must be read to give effect to that scheme ...
