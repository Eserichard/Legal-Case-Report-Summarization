<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1117">This proceeding has been running for some time. It is not yet complete. Several previous judgments have been given on en-route to date: P1/2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1029 ; P1/2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1370 ; Plaintiff P1/2003 v Ruddock [2007] FCA 65 ; (2007) 157 FCR 518 ; and Sadiqi v The Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 1262.  It is unnecessary to repeat the summary of the statement of claim which I set out at some length in Sadiqi [2008] FCA 1262. It may assist as a guide however, before coming to the agreed facts, to record by way of convenient summary, the tabular chronology prepared by the defendants. I do not understand the synopsis to be contested (at least as to its limited purpose in these reasons which is only to assist as to a chronological guide to where and when the plaintiff was located between 8 November 2001 and 25 February 2004).</sentence>
