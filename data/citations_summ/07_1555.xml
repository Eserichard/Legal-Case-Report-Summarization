 Introduction 
 
1 This is an application for leave to appeal and for consequential orders from orders made by Gordon J on 8 October 2007. There were two separate notices of motion before Gordon J. She made orders in each of the proceedings and published separate reasons for those orders: Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1555 ; Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1556. The orders made in both proceedings are the subject of this application for leave to appeal. 2 The application was brought by notice of motion filed on 15 October 2007 and supported by an affidavit of the applicant sworn on the same day.</sentence>

 ANALYSIS 
 Application for leave to access transcripts: para 1 of the Notice of Motion 
 
 4 Ms Bahonko seeks an order that the Court make available to her a transcript in an electronic form or in a printed form of the substantive proceedings before Jessup J.  14 On 24 May 2007, following the closure of the respondents' evidentiary case on the two applications (see [2007] FCA 1555 at [4] ) before Jessup J, Ms Bahonko attempted to make a range of oral applications including an application to file a statement of charge for contempt of court against the respondent and the respondents' legal representatives, Mr McKenney and Mr Vitiello, and sought to challenge the competency of two of the witnesses called on behalf of the respondents, the fourth respondent and Ms Esther Matthews. Jessup J did not grant leave to file these applications: see [8] at paras (2) and (4) and [9] of Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 867. </sentence>
