<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 69">The debtor also submitted that the defect complained of is one that was not within s.41(5) because the defect was not " only that the sum specified in the notice as the amount due to the creditor exceeds the amount in fact due ", but, he submitted, while the amount specified in the notice as due ($92,862.40) exceeded the amount in fact due there was another related defect in the omission to record in the schedule the payment or credit received since the date of the judgments. In support of that general proposition the debtor relied upon the observations of various courts found within the authorities of St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd v Spalla [2000] FCA 1094 ; (2000) 181 ALR 682 , SGRO v Liberty Funding Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 625 , Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins (No.5) [2008] FCA 794 and Robert Hudson Junior v Thomas James Donald &amp; Anor [1997] FCA 852. Specifically in respect of third party payments he referred to Somes v Duke Group Ltd (supra) . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 602">Insofar as they may be taken to suggest that there was an overstatement of the debt in the bankruptcy notice on the basis that they dispute the calculation of that debt, there is no suggestion or evidence that there was a notice given under s.41(5) of the Bankruptcy Act in relation to such an issue (see Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins (No 5) (2008) 6 ABC(NS) 82; [2008] FCA 794). I reiterate what I said in relation to the inappropriateness of going behind the judgment if the amount said to be owed is said to be overstated, but nonetheless would still be an amount sufficient to support the petition. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 403">I note that in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins (No 5) (2008) 72 ATR 398 ; [2008] FCA 794 Gilmour J rejected a contention that a bankruptcy notice that underpinned a creditor's petition was invalid because it overstated the amount in fact due by not including in Item 5 of the Schedule payments made and/or credits to which the debtor was entitled relating to the period after the judgment and before the date of issue of the bankruptcy notice where no notice in accordance with s.41(5) had been given by the debtor to the creditor. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 307">Mr Price drew the Court's attention to the decision in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [No.5] (2008) FCA 794 per Gilmour J where the Court decided not to follow St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd v Spalla (supra) on the basis that there had been a mere overstatement of the debt. Instead, Her Honour followed the decision in Hudson v Donald &amp; Whalan [1997] FCA 852 per Lindgren J that had been handed down prior to Spalla and had not sited the argument before Heerey J in Spalla. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 193">Further, while s.41(5) of the Act provides that a bankruptcy notice is not invalidated " by reason only that the sum specified in the notice as the amount due to the creditor exceeds the amount in fact due ", in this case the notice cannot be said to be defective only by reason of the overstatement of the amount in fact due. The notice also omits the provision under which interest is claimed. This is a discrete " defect " (cf Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [No 5] [2008] FCA 794 and Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2008) 172 FCR 425 ; [2008] FCAFC 185). </sentence>
