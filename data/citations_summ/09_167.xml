<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 794">In summary, it is submitted that there was no procedural unfairness in this regard because: The decision is to which s.422B of the Act applies; The similar claims information was extant in the delegate's decision; [33] The Applicant was on notice that this was an issue dispositive of the review ( SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [34] ); The information was put to the Applicant at the Tribunal hearing; [35] Whilst the information was not put to the Applicant during the hearing in the way prescribed by s.424AA of the Act there was no obligation to do so ( SZMIS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [36] at [10]-[11] per Marshall J); A failure to apply s.424AA properly does not of itself give rise to jurisdictional error ( SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [37] per Gilmour J at [19]); and The Tribunal sought comment from the Applicant on the issue by means of the s.424A letter of 19 th December 2008. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 578">It may finally be noted that, even if there has been a failure to comply with s 424AA(b)(iv) , the consequence is that s 424A(2A) is not engaged and the Tribunal is not thereby excused from compliance with s 424A(1): SZMMP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 233 at [55] per Lander J. Sections 424A and 424AA are complementary: SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 at [2] per Moore J; SZMIS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 167 at [10] per Marshall J. But no failure to comply with s 424A(1) is asserted by the now Appellant and none is otherwise discernible. </sentence>
