<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 1930">50 Federal Magistrate Driver considered the evidence in relation to this allegation and rejected it. His Honour gave reasons for that finding. I see no error in his Honour's conclusion. A claim under s 28A must be analysed on the basis of the nature or quality of the act: see, for example, Gauci v Kennedy [2007] FCA 1051 at [22] . Irrespective of Ms Huang's present belief that the contact between Professor Winder's hand and her hip constituted sexual harassment, she has not shown that his Honour was in error in concluding (at [89]) that ' the contact that occurred between Professor Winder and Ms Huang was accidental and non-sexual as they passed in the corridor '.
