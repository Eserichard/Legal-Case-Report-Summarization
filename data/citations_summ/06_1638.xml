<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 843">Mr King was granted leave to appear as a non-lawyer in the industrial matter of Hadgkiss v Aldin , [67] in which it was held that: 12. ... I accept that this present case could be complex, certainly from the perspective of the seventy-second respondent, a carpenter by trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FMCA 1204">The issue of the appearance of lay advocates was considered in the by Nicholson J in Hadgkiss v Aldin [2006] FCA 1638 at [10] where His Honour stated: [10] The powers of the Court pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court Act to make orders granting leave for an unqualified advocate to appear were reviewed by Bennett J in Melaleuca of Australia and New Zealand Pty Ltd v Duck [2005] FCA 1481 (Melaleuca). It is not necessary here to set out again the other Rules and considerations to which her Honour made reference. She particularly had regard to the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Damjanovic v Maley [2002] NSWCA 230 ; (2002) 55 NSWLR 149 (Damjanovic) , where their Honours found that there was nothing exceptional or special to warrant the grant of such leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] VSCA 131">There are too the developments in this area of the law in England, which are encapsulated in Lord Lowry's eight part categorisation of the cases in Hanlon v The Law Society [15] (of which one is "where a statutory provision permits exceptions to be made to it by regulations" [16] ). And I note that in John Ward v Commissioner of Police [17] Moore J of the Federal Court of Australia referred to the Hanlon analysis with apparent albeit qualified approval. I also agree with the judge below that, just as when a section of an Act of Parliament expresses itself as being subject to another section of the Act it may be taken as meaning that the latter is to some extent intended to prevail, [18] so too when a section of an Act of Parliament expresses itself as subject to regulations it may be taken as meaning that the latter is to some extent intended to prevail. Most importantly, however, the fundamental question is whether the regulations are within the scope of the section, [19] and as a matter of logic and common sense one can hardly come to a view about that without first looking to the regulations to which the section expresses itself to be subject. 29 The appellants argue that that is a false analogy.</sentence>
