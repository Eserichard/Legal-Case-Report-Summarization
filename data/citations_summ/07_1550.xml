Each factor needs to be weighed in the " intuitive synthesis " involved in the sentencing process (see Australian Opthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith (2008) 165 FCR 560 ; [2008] FCAFC 8 and Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan (2008) 168 FCR 383 ; [2008] FCAFC 70 at [60] --- [63] and cases cited therein). </sentence>

 Delivered at: Perth 
 Delivered on: 8 October 2010 
 REPRESENTATION
 Counsel for the First and Second Applicants: Mr J Nicholas 
 Solicitor for the First and Second Applicants: Shannon Walker, CFMEU 
 For the Respondent: Mr M Slabbert (by leave) 
 ORDERS
 
 (1) That in relation to the Respondent's contraventions of regulation 3.42(4) of the Fair Work Regulations 2009 (Cth) in relation to the First and Second Applicants the Respondent pay a penalty of $4,400. (2) That the penalty ordered to be paid under order (1) above be paid by the Respondent to the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, by 8 January 2011. What this extract from Kelly means is that the size of a business does not affect the obligation to comply with the FW Act . It nevertheless is appropriate to take into account the contravener's size and financial resources, including their capacity to pay, when independently determining the quantum of any penalty, [45] as was explained by the Federal Court in Dogma Enterprises : The size of the business enterprise involved has led to some debate between the parties. It is clear enough that this is a suburban store of modest proportions in overall terms. However, it is a significant business enterprise and the reality is that many potential breaches of awards will take place by small enterprises. Nonetheless, it seems to me that the size of the undertaking is relevant, because the nature of a penalty, being by way of deterrent, needs to take account of the amount which would be such as to deter the enterprise itself from re-offending. It must be big enough to cause the enterprise not to risk the eventuality of a penalty by breaching awards and then buying their way out. However, as has been put, we are not, here, talking about BHP Billiton or David Jones. [46] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FMCA 718">In Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd (supra) per Gray J at [27] and Graham J at [55] and [78] their Honours indicated that the Court should apply an "instinctive synthesis" in making this assessment. The factors relevant to the imposition of a penalty under the WR Act have been summarised in the frequently quoted decision of Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd t/as Pangaea Restaurants and Bars [2007] FMCA 7 per Mowbray FM which was subsequently adopted in Kelly v Fitzpatrick (supra) per Tracey J at [14]. It is acknowledged that while the summary in Pangaea is a convenient checklist, it does not prescribe or restrict the matters which may be taken into account in the exercise of the Court's discretion: Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 per Gyles at [11]; Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith (supra) per Buchannan J at [91]. Penalty in respect of Third Respondent
 Counsel for the applicant, in his written submissions, indicate that he relies upon the following material in respect to penalty: Affidavit of Bianca Sorrenti dated 9 September 2009 at paras.9, 10, 17, 18; Affidavits of Wayne Brogan dated 10 September 2009 at paras.4, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20; Affidavit of Third Respondent dated 8 April 2010; Minutes of Chilis management meeting held on 14 January 2008, 4 February 2008 and 10 April 2008; and Mr Selinger, in his written submissions, submits that Mr Reynolds' breaches are able to be categorised as follows: Failure to pay Ms Sorrenti accrued and untaken annual leave (cl.28(g) Sorrenti AWA) (maximum penalty $6,600.00); Failure to pay Mr Brogan and untaken annual leave (cl.28(g) Brogan AWA) (maximum penalty $6,600.00). 
In respect of these breaches, it was submitted that they should be properly characterised as two distinct breaches arising out of two separate courses of conduct as there are a number of factors which indicate that the breaches arose in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FMCA 384">Both counsel framed their submissions on penalty by reference to headings taken from the well-known list of sentencing considerations suggested in this area by Mowbray FM in Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 , and summarised by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at [14] . As I have noted in previous cases, a list of considerations can guide, but is not a substitute for "the unrestrained statutory discretion" (cf.

Ultimately, I must arrive at an amount within the range of penalties provided in the legislation which is proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed and also takes into account other sentencing considerations including deterrence (cf. Graham J in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 at [54] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FMCA 204">the size of the prescribed penalty, and any recent increases to that prescription; and the totality principle. This is not an exhaustive list of considerations that the Court may take into account. [5] Nature and extent of the conduct which led to the contravention
 The nature of the conduct was a failure by the respondents to keep records as prescribed by the WR Regulations and a failure to produce records the subject of a written request dated 23 February 2009 by the applicant, [6] in relation to one employee. [7] The Request was to make available the following records in relation to the Employee: all wage and time records relating to the Employee from 1 July 2008 to the termination date of 12 August 2008; annual leave records for the full period of employment (being the period from and including 15 May 2006 to 12 August 2008); any record containing the date of commencement of employment; and any record containing evidence of the date of termination of employment. The failure to produce these records must be considered in the context of the reason for the requirement to produce records, as set out below. [8] On 25 February 2009, Industrial Roadpavers provided the Workplace Inspector [9] with fortnightly payroll advices in respect of the Employee between 26 June 2008 and 6 August 2008. </sentence>

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 Introduction 
 The respondent, Macmahon Mining Services Pty Ltd [1] employed the applicant, Mr Williams to work at the Argyle Diamond mine site [2] from 9 November 2006 to 16 December 2007. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 1255">Hence it is necessary to determine an appropriate penalty in respect of each course of conduct or contravention having regard to all of the circumstances of the case before considering the application of the totality principle to the aggregate penalty. The factors relevant to the imposition of penalties under the Act have been considered in a number of cases. In Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Limited [2007] FMCA 7 Mowbray FM referred to a " non-exhaustive " range of considerations. This list was adopted by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick . Such a list does not prescribe or restrict the matters which may be taken into account in the exercise of the court's discretion (see Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 at [11] and Australian Ophthalmic Supplies at [91] per Buchanan J). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FMCA 1003">It is often convenient to address penalty by reference to a list of considerations, such as those identified by Mowbray FM in Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 and summarised by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at [14] . A list of considerations can guide the identification of the appropriate penalties, but is not a substitute for "the unrestrained statutory discretion" (cf. Gyles J in Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 at [11] ). Ultimately, I must arrive at an amount within the range of penalties provided in the legislation which is proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed (cf.

I accept his submissions, and do not propose to repeat all the points he makes, nor provide discussion under each of those heading. The list of considerations can guide, but is not a substitute for "the unrestrained statutory discretion" (cf. Gyles J in Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 at [11] ). Ultimately, I must arrive at an amount within the range of penalties provided in the legislation which is proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed (cf. Graham J in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 at [54]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FMCA 1105">Although I must explain the considerations which influence my assessment, it has been recognised that sentencing is an 'instinctive synthesis' of relevant considerations. Helpful lists of considerations have been adopted in previous cases, and I am entitled to draw from these, without treating them as a substitute for "the unrestrained statutory discretion" (cf. Gyles J in Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 at [11] ). 4. I propose to discuss what I regard as significant considerations in the present case under headings which reflect the matters listed by Branson J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2007] FCAFC 18 ; [2007] FCAFC 18 ; (2007) 157 FCR 329 at [181] and the longer list of considerations which was distilled by Mowbray FM in Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 , as summarised by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at [14] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2008] FMCA 1028">On the material before the Court and in light of the fact that the breaches are admitted, it is not possible to determine with accuracy the precise extent to which there were breaches of each term of the award before the maximum was raised. Rather than proceed on the basis that the maximum penalty should be a specified figure somewhere between the amounts before and after the increase (as Gyles J did in Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 where the increase in the maximum rate occurred approximately half way through the period in issue) I consider it appropriate to have regard to this issue as a factor relevant to the exercise of my discretion. The admitted breaches
  As acknowledged for the applicant, it is appropriate in determining the penalties to have regard to the " non-exhaustive " range of considerations identified by Mowbray FM in Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Limited [2007] FMCA 7 and adopted by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick . However this list of matters does not prescribe or restrict the matters which may be taken into account in the exercise of the court's discretion (see Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 at [11] and Australian Ophthalmic Supplies at [91] per Buchanan J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] FMCA 920">The ultimate object of an assessment of penalty is to arrive at an amount within the range of penalties provided in the legislation which is proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed (cf. Graham J in Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 at [54] ). Although I must explain the considerations which influence my assessment, it has been recognised that sentencing is an 'instinctive synthesis' of relevant considerations.

<sentence id="cs22" from="[2008] FMCA 213">As his Honour implied, such matters can only be a guide to the exercise of "the unrestrained statutory discretion": Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1550 per Gyles J at [11]. The nature and extent of the conduct

 Generally
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2008] FMCA 101">I do not consider that this element, of itself, should result in its breaches being regarded more seriously than non-compliance with the same award conditions by a smaller or more financially vulnerable enterprise (but compare Gyles J in Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 at [15] ). There are, however, elements in the circumstances of the breaches relating to the respondent's business structure and position in the industry, which require me to treat the breaches as serious and inexcusable, and which support the imposition of a substantial penalty. I shall point to these below. Whether or not the breaches were deliberate 
  I shall determine the appropriate penalties for the respondent's admitted breaches, after addressing the list of considerations which was distilled by Mowbray FM in Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd (supra), as summarised by Tracey J in Kelly v Fitzpatrick (supra) at [14]. This may guide, but not be treated as a substitute for, "the unrestrained statutory discretion" (cf. Gyles J in Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 at [11] ). The nature and extent of the conduct leading to the breaches 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs25" from="[2008] FMCA 79">The parties accepted that these considerations should guide the exercise of the Court's discretion in these proceedings and made submissions as to penalty on that basis. Before turning to consider those submissions 
I note the comments made by Gyles J in Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 (" Sharpe ") at [11] that: "...although it is convenient to refer to the headings, the discretion as to the imposition of a penalty is quite unrestrained by the statute. There are no mandatory matters to be taken into account. I would not agree to substituting a judge's checklist for the unrestrained statutory discretion. " The nature and extent of the conduct
