<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 134">Administration of the PILT Trust and the Baltarna Trust is an important aspect of ensuring that Valofo's interests as beneficiary are protected, and obviously, if there is a clear conflict between the interests of a proposed trustee and the interests of the trusts and beneficiaries, that person is not an appropriate person to be appointed. The issue of conflict in relation to liquidators of a corporate trustee is discussed in Wells v Wily [2004] NSWSC 607 ; (2004) 183 FLR 284 at [32] - [38] per Austin J; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 135 ; (2006) 227 ALR 623 , a decision of Siopis J, particularly at [26]; and Dreiberg v Bettles and Carter as Liquidators of Corindi Beach Developments Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1204 , particularly at [5]-[7] and [14]. In each of these cases, liquidators of a corporate trustee were appointed as trustees in their personal right. Here the liquidators are liquidators of the sole beneficiary not the corporate trustee so the utility of appointing the liquidators is even more obvious, and the cases to which I have referred make it clear that the Court is not concerned with theoretical or hypothetical conflicts.

<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1541">48 In my view, the appropriate approach is to appoint the liquidator who has power to administer any trust assets (at least at the early states) (see Crest Realty Pty Ltd (No 2) (in liquidation) (1977) 1 NSWLR 664 and Wells v Wily [2004] NSWSC 607) , and the liquidator can approach the Court if any problems arise. I would not think it desirable to separate the function of the liquidator and any receiver of the trust assets in this case, and these functions should (at least initially) be fulfilled by the same person. The liquidator may apply to the Court if his appointment needs to be extended to that of receiver of the trust assets or if he needs further assistance. Equally, if any conflict arises because of the appointment of Mr McCann to other companies associated to APM, he can apply to seek directions on how to deal with that conflict: see ASIC v Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 135 ; (2006) 56 ACSR 646 at 652.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FMCA 668">Mr Free covers the Tribunal's concern about the absence of information; in particular the alleged non-reporting of the demonstration. He argues that this could be characterised as information of general application and hence within the terms of the exception SZHVC v MIMA [2006] FCA 135 at [15] and provides an alternative that in any event the lack of information is not "information"; it is merely an observation about a gap which was considered by the Full Court in SZEEU v MIMA [2006] FCAFC 2 at [208] . Mr Free also submits, rightly to my mind, that the Tribunal's reasoning about inconsistencies between the applicant's account and the independent sources was not itself information for the purposes of s.424A: 
"As this was an aspect of the RRT's subjective appraisal of the evidence rather than being information of which the RRT had been told or apprised; SZEEU v The Minister supra at 206 per Allsop J. "

<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] NSWSC 76">12 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 135 ; (2006) 227 ALR 623 at p.629, Siopis J said:

"[32] ... I agree that the observations made by Lehane J in Chilia , referred to above, state the principles to be applied in this case. The principles are also reflected in the following observations by Hoffmann J (as he then was) in Re Arrows Ltd [1992] BCC 121 , which were cited with approval by Warren J in Sisu Capital (at 123):
'... It is by no means uncommon in the case of the insolvency of a substantial group of companies for cross-claims and conflicts of interest to arise between companies within the group. That does not usually deflect the court from appointing a single firm of insolvency practitioners in the first instance to deal with the whole insolvency of the group, leaving the question of potential conflict of interests to be dealt with if and when it arises. '

 [33] I accept the arguments advanced by Mr Colvin SC and Mr Thomson that in the situation where there is no obvious and real conflict but there is a possibility of a theoretical conflict, a court should not thereby be inhibited from appointing a single set of liquidators when that would advance the efficiency of the liquidation and result in fewer fees being charged in respect of the liquidation.
