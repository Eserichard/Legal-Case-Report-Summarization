<citphrase id="cp16.13" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 85">administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 (cth), ss. 27 , 28 , 33 , 43 (2), 44 . the minister ordered the deportation of the defendant under s. 12 of the migration act 1958 . upon the defendant's application for review of that decision the administrative appeals tribunal ("the tribunal") recommended its revocation. the minister appealed from that decision on the ground inter alia that the tribunal wrongly regarded itself as being restricted in reaching its decision by misconceived principles of law. the minister relied upon three passages in the tribunal's reasons to establish this ground. the first of those passages read: "when an alien who is an established resident becomes liable to deportation under s. 12 , the general rule must be that the conduct which is relied on to show that a deportation order is in the best interests of australia must be proved, not merely suspected."  held: per curiam</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp16.14" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 85">(1) as to the passages in the decision of the tribunal, other than that set out above, relied upon by the minister, the tribunal had not purported to lay down any binding principle of law but merely what it saw as general principles of fairness and common sense which were considered appropriate to the case before the tribunal and which the president stated in general terms for the guidance of members of the tribunal in the future performance of their functions.  per deane j., with whose reasons for judgment evatt j. agreed</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp16.15" type=cited from="[1980] FCA 85">(2) a similar position existed in relation to the first passage quoted above.  (3) in any event as a matter of law the tribunal was required in the circumstances to observe that principle because: (a) the tribunal is under a duty to observe the requirements of natural justice. sullivan v. department of transport (1978), 20 alr 323 ; drake v. minister for immigration and ethnic affairs [1979] aata 179 ; (1979), 24 alr 577 , applied. (b) it is an ordinary requirement of natural justice that a person bound to act judicially "base his decision" upon material which tends logically to show the existence or non-existence of facts relevant to the issue to be determined. r. v. deputy industrial injuries commissioner; ex parte moore, (1965) 1 qb 4568 applied.</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 965">It is well established that findings of fact including findings in relation to credibility are a matter for the AAT. It is pre-eminently the prerogative of the AAT to allocate the appropriate weight to the evidence before it. The weight to be given is not a question of law unless it can be said that the decision is unreasonable ( SZJEZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1741 at [15] ). But unreasonable in this sense means reaching a finding unsupported by any evidence or based on findings thought to be supported by inferences drawn from primary facts where those inferences were not open as a matter of law. I am unable to conclude that any reasonable person being apprised of the issues involved and the role of the Tribunal could entertain a reasonable apprehension that the AAT in this circumstance might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question which was before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 549">In my opinion, the approach of the learned Federal Magistrate was correct. I have dealt with the general submission but on the two errors supposedly made, these would not suffice to constitute jurisdictional error. It is clear that even if the reasoning whereby the Court reached its conclusion of fact were demonstrably unsound, that would not amount to an error of law: SZJEZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1741. In SZJEZ , his Honour referred to the decision of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi [2001] FCA 744 ; (2001) 65 ALD 141 where the Full Court stated: 
 A party does not establish an error of law by showing that the decision-maker inferred the existence of a particular fact by a faulty process, for example, by engaging in an illogical course of reasoning. Thus, at common law, want of logic is not synonymous with error of law. So long as the particular inference is reasonably open, even if that inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning, there is no place for judicial review because no error of law has taken place.
