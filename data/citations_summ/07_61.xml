The interlocutory process also sought an order that Mr Parsons file and serve an affidavit disclosing the facts and circumstances under which the sums of $610,000 and $1,527,000 were received by CBI from Newpage on 1 June and 22 September 2006 respectively, and as to any disposition or use by CBI or Mr Parsons of those amounts, and their present whereabouts. In the event, on 25 January 2007 Stone J ordered that Newpage be wound up and that Mr Hamilton be appointed as liquidator (see Elderslie Finance Corporation Limited v Newpage Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 61).
