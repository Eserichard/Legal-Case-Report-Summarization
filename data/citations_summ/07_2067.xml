<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1301">The lawful discharge of the functions conferred by s 16 "must necessarily have been determined" in reaching the conclusion that Mr Brock was eligible for surrender. It is considered unnecessary to resolve the question as to the extent of---or the nature of---the review which is permitted under s 21 as to whether the requirements of s 19(1) have been satisfied. Justice Gyles has very recently queried whether the requirements of s 19(1) could be considered in a review pursuant to s 21 and whether challenges to those requirements were to be made by way of separate proceedings based on administrative law grounds: Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067 at [4] . His Honour, however, also there referred to Knauder and Brock as providing a basis for the "current practice" that some form of review was permissible. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that there was no challenge in the s 21 review to whether or not there had been compliance with s 16(2)(a)(ii) and to note that there was no outstanding collateral challenge to the s 16 notice prior to the s 21 review being concluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1539">4 On 6 June 2007 a magistrate determined pursuant to s 19 of the Act that Mr Tervonen was eligible for surrender for offences itemised in the amended notice issued on 30 April 2007. However, on 6 November 2007 Rares J decided that each of the first two notices was invalid ( Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 1684). As a result, on 20 December 2007 Gyles J ordered that the magistrate's order made on 6 June 2007 be quashed ( Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1432">5 On 6 November 2007 Rares J decided that each of the two notices was invalid ( Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 1684). As a result, on 20 December 2007 Gyles J ordered that the magistrate's order made on 6 June 2007 be quashed ( Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067). Appeals against the orders made by Rares J and Gyles J were later upheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 781">2 The general nature of the jurisdiction pursuant to s 21 of the Act is not in doubt --- it is a rehearing in which the Court reaches its own conclusions on the eligibility for surrender, although only having regard to the material before the Magistrate ( Dutton v O'Shane [2003] FCAFC 195 ; (2003) 132 FCR 352 at 386; Brock v United States of America [2007] FCAFC 3 ; (2007) 157 FCR 121 per Black CJ at [20]---[24] and [29] and Rares J at [73]---[80]). Tervonen challenges both satisfaction of the conditions precedent in s 19(1) and the conclusions on the merits of surrender reached by the Magistrate pursuant to s 19(2). In Tervonen [2007] FCA 2067 (at [6]---[9]), I discussed the question as to how a review is to be conducted in relation to s 19(1). It is convenient to deal with the questions arising pursuant to s 19(2) in the first instance.
  1 On 20 December 2007 I made orders pursuant to s 21(2)(b)(i) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) (the Act) on the application of Jan Tervonen quashing an order of the second respondent made on 6 June 2007 that Tervonen was eligible for surrender to the first respondent, the Republic of Finland, for certain offences, and the consequent issue of a warrant pursuant to s 19(9) of the Act ( Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067). That decision was based upon the judgment of Rares J in Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 1684 ; (2007) 98 ALD 589 and consequent orders declaring invalid and quashing successive notices purporting to have been given pursuant to s 16 of the Act ( Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 3) [2007] FCA 1898). That basis for the decision meant that I did not need to consider the other arguments raised on behalf of Tervonen. The Full Court allowed an appeal from the decision of Rares J ( Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24 , corrected in Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen (No 2) [2008] FCAFC 32). Consequently, on 6 March 2008, the Full Court allowed an appeal from my earlier decision, set aside the orders that I had made and remitted the matter to me to be determined according to law ( Republic of Finland v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 25).  33 I need not repeat the discussion concerning the proper approach to this provision in a s 21 review set out in Tervonen [2007] FCA 2067 at [6] ---[9]. The approach most favourable to Tervonen is that the issues are to be decided on the merits. I will consider them on that basis in the first instance. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 99">2 It is unnecessary for present purposes to detail the sequence of those various challenges. It is sufficient to note that on 20 December 2007 Gyles J ordered that the Applicant be released from custody: Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 2107">2 The circumstances in which Mr Tervonen came to be arrested were that, on 20 December 2007, the previous day, Gyles J had ordered that a magistrate in New South Wales, in respect of whom there was an arrangement in force under s 46 of the Act, order Mr Tervonen's release from custody: see Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067.  6 Gyles J had proceeded on the basis that before him there was no dispute, following my decision, that in the s 19 proceedings before the magistrate the requirement in s 19(1)(b) of the Act that there be a notice under s 16 had not been satisfied: see Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067 at [10] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 2091">67 It is considered unnecessary to resolve the question as to the extent of -- or the nature of -- the review which is permitted under s 21 as to whether the requirements of s 19(1) have been satisfied.

His Honour, however, also there referred to Knauder v Moore [2002] FCAFC 404 ; (2002) 127 FCR 327 and Brock v United States of America [2007] FCAFC 3 ; (2007) 157 FCR 121 as providing a basis for the " current practice " that some form of review was permissible. </sentence>
