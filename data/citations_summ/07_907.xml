<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 20">Even if the Tribunal's mis-characterisation, and failure to grant relief by reason of its failure to consider the abduction incident at all was a jurisdictional error, the Court is not inclined to grant prerogative relief in any event. Prerogative relief is discretionary. Prerogative relief need not be granted where the outcome of the grant of relief would lack utility or be futile, [63] in the sense that the outcome would not alter if the grant of prerogative relief requiring reconsideration of the matter by the Tribunal would not result in a different outcome. In this case, the outcome would be no different because, for reasons set out above, the abduction incident claim does not have as the foundation for the fear alleged a Convention based reason, and, further, the applicant conceded that to be the case. The grant of prerogative relief would therefore be futile, and, in the exercise of the Court's discretion, should not be granted. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 813">What is abundantly clear is that even if the matter were to be returned to the Tribunal, in circumstances where the Tribunal had affirmed the delegate's decision in relation to the Association, and I could find no jurisdictional error in that decision ( North Shore Sikh Association Incorporated ), then in relation to Mr Singh's visa application the Tribunal would be bound to affirm the delegate's decision in relation to him, even after attending to its s.359A obligation. (See Barkat v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 510 , Hao Jiang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 907 and Wang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 488. ) </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 132">Relief is discretionary 
 The Court is entitled to consider whether prerogative relief would be granted in the exercise of the discretion to do so. Having established jurisdictional error, Mr Kabir is, on the face of it, entitled to prerogative relief, unless the grant of relief "would lack utility" [111] or "be an exercise in futility". [112] The question here is whether prerogative relief would lack utility or be an exercise in futility. There can be no doubt that the Tribunal was justified in finding that Mr Kabir had 24 months of study on the basis of his studies: for a Certificate III in Hospitality at ASTHM; in the Bachelor of Business Degree at the University of Notre Dame; in a further hospitality course at ASTHM; and for studies when re-enrolled in the Bachelor of Business Degree at ECU. For reasons set out above, the Tribunal should also have had regard to the period of study Mr Kabir undertook in the Diploma of Business at PIBT, that period being two years and four months.</sentence>

In Chen v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1285 at para.47 Barnes FM said: if I am wrong and in fact this is an error that should be regarded as a jurisdictional error, I would exercise my discretion not to grant relief, consistent with the approach considered in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ; [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 , on the basis that remittal to the Tribunal would be futile.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FMCA 1944">I am not persuaded by this argument. I have had regard to the fact that the undisputed evidence in relation to whether there was a s.417 request extant at the time of the bridging visa application is such that the applicant could not have satisfied those criteria that relate to such a request (subclauses 050.212(b), (6AA) and (6A)) if the matter were remitted to the Tribunal. (see Jankovic v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1994] FCA 1316 ; (1995) 56 FCR 474 ; Morales v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic affairs (1995) 60 FCR 550 Wang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 488 and Jiang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 907. However, a reconstituted Tribunal would consider afresh each of the criteria in clause 050.212. Other issues might have emerged in any such reconsideration, given that not all of the grounds in clause 050.212 turn on objective criteria or facts (see eg. subclauses 050.212(2) and 050.212(3)(b)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FMCA 217">On the Applicant's own case he could not have succeeded before the Tribunal on that basis. Therefore, insofar as the invalidity of the regulations is concerned, prerogative relief would be futile, and ought not be granted. [75] 
 77. The Applicant also submitted that Item 6A 81(b) was a special regulation which prevailed over regulation 2.27C and clause 880-222A. In the circumstances, the Court need not determine that issue.</sentence>
