<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 175">As the interlocutory judgments ( Wide Bay Conservation Council Inc v Burnett Water Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 237 and Wide Bay Conservation Council Inc v Burnett Water Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 540) in this matter reveal, the formulation of the Conservation Council's case proved controversial. Its statement of claim underwent much revision. As finally amended, the Conservation Council alleged (para 17 of the further amended statement of claim) and Burnett Water denied that a fish transfer device which was suitable for the lungfish was one which: 
 
 17. ... 
 
 
 
 
 (a) is likely to allow any normal sized lungfish attempting to move upstream and downstream of the dam wall to do so without injury or death irrespective of the water level in the dam ;
 (b) operates continuously each day of the year both day and night, subject only to minor interruptions for repairs and maintenance and environmental flows, such interruptions being on average less than 5% of total time per annum ; and/or 
 (c) is actually operating to allow any normal sized lungfish to move upstream and downstream of the dam wall .
