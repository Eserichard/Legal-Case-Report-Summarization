<sentence id="cs1" from="[2006] FCA 695">36 It must be borne in mind that the persons to whom Mr Spencer was required to provide the documents were former franchisees of Contact Plus. Those persons had had a very unhappy experience with Contact Plus and Mr Spencer. Mr Spencer had threatened to commence legal proceedings against a number of the former franchisees: see Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Contact Plus Group Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 396 at [29] . The content of the 6 April email shows that Mr Spencer maintained considerable ill-will towards the intended recipients of the email. It also reveals that he felt aggrieved by the outcome of the proceedings and was antagonistic towards the applicant and the addressees of the email. </sentence>
