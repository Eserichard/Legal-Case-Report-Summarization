<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1044">Finally rejected is the further submission that the Tribunal's reliance upon the questionnaire was an impermissible reliance upon an absence of evidence or reliable evidence as a basis upon which the hypothesis could be rejected. Reliance upon the decision in Tunks v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 521 , 102 ALD 274 is, with respect, misplaced. Madgwick J there relevantly concluded: 
 
 [46] While the reasons of the tribunal are to be read with due generosity, the language used here by it suggests inescapably that it approached its task incorrectly. The tribunal stated that it was "satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the factual foundation upon which the hypothesis can operate does not exist" because there was "no evidence as to pre-war consumption and no reliable evidence as to the amount of post-war consumption". An absence of evidence or of reliable evidence cannot be a sufficient basis for the tribunal to reach the requisite level of satisfaction that either a fact asserted by a claimant is not true, or that a contrary fact is true. 
 

 
This proposition advanced by Madgwick J is accepted. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] AATA 710">Unfortunately there is very little material before me on this point. It is necessary to carefully examine all of the material to determine whether or not a causal link to service is pointed to or raised, or whether it can reasonably be inferred from those materials. This is not a case in which there is material from Mr Myers or from his widow, or anyone else for that matter, concerning his development of a liking for foods he consumed during the period of his service. Mrs Myers' evidence points to Mr Myers disliking foods that he consumed on service. In her oral evidence she said that her husband told her that the food on service was not satisfying, the servings were small and they had a lot of canned food --- " he said it was rubbish, especially the camp pie ". To that extent at least cases such as Tunks v Repatriation Commission [38] are distinguished. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 641">In doing so, it is useful to refer to the four steps expounded in Repatriation Commission v Deledio. [4] Neither a substitute for the statute nor an algorithm, the four Deledio steps are still helpful in navigating the statutory requirements. [5] The four Deledio steps are as follows: The tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury, disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person. No question of fact finding arises at this stage. If no such hypothesis arises, the application must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] AATA 370">The Secretary cited decisions of this Tribunal and single judge decisions of the Federal Court of Australia in regard to what is meant by "special circumstances". However, as Madgwick J stated in a different statutory context, decision makers treating a decided case as "a substitute for the statute and ... an algorithm, indeed the only available algorithm, seems in practice to have created at least as many problems as ... [the decided case] ... intended that they should avoid": Tunks v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 521 at [34] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] AATA 229">That decision was set aside by the Federal Court (Madgwick J) and remitted to the Tribunal to be reheard. See Tunks v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 521. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] AATA 65">Mr Chancellor, representing Mrs Polack, suggested that the Tribunal should take account of the case of Tunks v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 521 where it was wrongly determined that there was no evidence about the early dietary habits of the veteran. However, in this matter, there is indeed evidence provided by Dr English which this Tribunal has determined is relevant. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] AATA 780">In considering the inconsistencies in and the credibility of Mr Carden's evidence I have referred to a recent decision of the Federal Court in the matter of Tunks v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 521. In that case Madgwick J, following the reasoning in Byrnes v Repatriation Commission (1993) 1777 CLR 564 , held that an applicant will only fail at Step 4 of the Deledio test if the Commission is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the factual foundation of the hypothesis has been disproved, either by proof that a fact relied upon in support is not true, or by proof of an inconsistent fact. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] AATA 506">I appreciate that Dr Malan in his report of 28 September 2007 to the Department of Veterans' Affairs has opined that there is no ongoing causal relationship with the service and his situation at the time. However, it is important for me to bear in mind that this veteran does not bear any onus of proving any matter that is or might be relevant to the determination of the application: see s120(6). The Federal Court of Australia has recently reaffirmed the long-standing principle that a hypothesis need not be proved upon the balance of probabilities [18] . </sentence>
