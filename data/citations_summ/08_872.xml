<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1058">Reservation has also been expressed as to the constraint suggested by Finkelstein J in Gribbles that in the absence of a hearing on the merits it is difficult to see how any order, other than an order that each party bear its own costs, can be made except in " special circumstances ": Champagne View Pty Ltd v Shearwater Resort Management Pty Ltd [2000] VSC 214 at [47] . Each case, it was there correctly observed, " must depend upon its own circumstances ". See also: Tervonen v Minister for Home Affairs (No 2) [2008] FCA 872 at [19] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1432">6 Meanwhile, on 11 November 2007 a third notice was issued. Mr Tervonen commenced proceedings challenging the third notice on 18 December 2007. The proceedings commenced by Mr Tervonen to challenge the third notice were the subject of judgments by Flick J on 30 April 2008 ( Tervonen v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCA 596) and 12 June 2008 ( Tervonen v Minister for Home Affairs (No 2) [2008] FCA 872). After the appeal against the judgment of Rares J was upheld on 6 March 2008 it was unnecessary for the Minister to rely upon the third notice and Flick J records that the Minister gave an assurance that no reliance would be placed on it. In response, Mr Tervonen's counsel accepted that there was no utility in further pursuing any challenge to it. He sought on Mr Tervonen's behalf, and Mr Tervonen was granted, leave to discontinue the proceedings commenced on 18 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1133">6 In addition to these proceedings, there was also a proceeding commenced by Mr Tervonen seeking to review the further notice issued in November 2007. That proceeding has since been resolved: Tervonen v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCA 872. </sentence>
