<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 833">Thirdly, the fact that an appeal will be rendered nugatory if a stay is not granted, is usually regarded as a substantial factor in favour of a stay. This, in turn, requires some assessment to be made to the prospects of success on the appeal: see, variously, Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd (Receivers Appointed) (1985) 2 NSWLR 685 at 695; Kalifair at [18]; Masri at [17]; HVAC at [49(b)] and Ng at [21]. That assessment has been described as: " a preliminary non-speculative assessment of whether the appellant by the grounds of appeal has raised an arguable case ... [involving] ... a low threshold of arguability ": see Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1867 at [40] per Greenwood J and Ng at [36]. Fourthly, if the grounds of appeal disclose an arguable case, it is necessary to consider where the balance of convenience lies. See Kalifair at [18] and Masri at [17].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 513">It seems to me that the authorities suggest that there is a relatively low threshold of arguability in relation to prospects of success (see Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1867 at [40] per Greenwood J). I am not in a position to conclude that the appeal has such poor prospects of success that this should be a material factor weighing in favour of the respondent seeking an order for security. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 89">I now turn to consider the issue of the prospects of success of the appeal. My assessment of those prospects at this very early stage of the proceedings can only be a " preliminary assessment about whether [she] has an arguable case ", or whether her appeal " has been lodged without any real prospect of success and simply in the hope of gaining a respite against immediate execution upon the judgment ": see Alexander at 695. The assessment has also been described as " a preliminary, non-speculative assessment of whether the appellant by the grounds of appeal has raised an arguable case " and involving a " low threshold of arguability ": see Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1867 at [40] per Greenwood J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 821">The application is made pursuant to O 52 r 17 of the Federal Court Rules . The principles upon which a stay should be granted are relatively straight forward and have been enunciated most recently in the decisions of Finkelstein J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v BMW (Australia) Limited (No 2) [2003] FCA 864 at [5] , McKerracher J in Harbour City Real Estate Pty Ltd t/as Re/Max Harbour City Real Estate (ACN 111 210 023) v Cargill [2008] FCA 1382 at [5] and Greenwood J in Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd (ACN 110 855 359) v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (ACN 095 659 733) [2008] FCA 1867 at [39] - [44]. I propose to apply those principles. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 452">On 10 December 2008, the Court granted an opposed application for a stay of the orders of 5 September 2008 on the cross-claim for payment by Citrus of $698,792.00, on condition that Citrus pay into Court an amount of $195,782.83 by 9 January 2009. That amount represented the unpaid loan component of the orders together with interest referable to that loan, up to judgment on 5 September 2008, of $45,782.83 ( Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1867). Citrus did not pay into Court the amount on which the stay was conditioned, by 9 January 2009. It has not been paid since 9 January 2009. Thus, there is no stay of the judgment debt on the cross-claim. On 25 February 2009, Sunstate Orchards made demand for payment of the judgment debt. No payment has been made. </sentence>
