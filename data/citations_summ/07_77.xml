<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FMCA 1617">I am also asked to make an order that no further application by the applicant to review the delegate's or Tribunal's decision be accepted for filing except with leave of the Court. I note the concern that has been expressed on occasion about the efficacy of such orders (see in particular SZASP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 77 at [24] per Moore J). I have given the benefit of the doubt to the applicants in relation to their understanding of the circumstances in which they find themselves and do not consider it appropriate to make such an order. Nonetheless for their benefit I note that were they to attempt to reinitiate proceedings in this Court on the same basis my conclusions might be otherwise in relation to whether the proceedings were vexatious and as to whether an order should be made preventing them from initiating further proceedings without the leave of the Court.
