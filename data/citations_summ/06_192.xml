<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1129"></sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 250">Factors which have been held to weigh in favour of exercising the discretion to order separate trials include: 
 (a) the issues concerning the party seeking the separate trial are distinct and discrete: Bishop v Bridgeland Securities at 314; 

 
 (b) a joint trial will involve the respondent in the expense of being present at the trial of questions with which they are not concerned and it would be unfair for the respondent to be compelled to participate in a large and costly proceeding where it has only marginal involvement: Hinze v Zed [1926] SASR 77 at 84; Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 192 at [30] and Newman v Hold Pty Ltd [2001] VSC 282 at [17] .

<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 943">26 In Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 192 , Lindgren J dealt inter alia with the terms of O 6 r 2. His Honour said:
 
 "25 Rule 2 (b) does not in terms limit the circumstances in which the Court may grant leave. Even if para (b) were limited to para (a) cases, para (b) would still have work to do: the Court might refuse leave because of considerations arising from the applicant's failure to join the parties at the outset, any delay of the applicant in seeking leave, the state of progression of the proceeding, any disruption likely to arise from the addition of parties, and other discretionary factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 70">207 The first and second spin-off books were published by Simon and Schuster Inc trading as Simon Spotlight Entertainment ('Simon and Schuster') and John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc ('Wiley') respectively after the proceedings were commenced. Mr Knight sought to join them to the proceedings. On 10 March 2006 Lindgren J refused this application ( Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2006] FCA 192). Lindgren J felt that any causes of action which existed against Simon Schuster and Wiley, who were licensed to publish and sell the books in the United States and Canada but not in Australia, should be pursued separately. Although there may have been some overlap with the present proceedings it was not desirable, in his Honour's view, that the present proceedings be extended to embrace them.</sentence>
