<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] VSC 555">14 Where a proceeding has resolved without an adjudication on the merits, it is often difficult for a court to reach any conclusion as to how the matter would have proceeded. [2] The general principles were conveniently summarised by Hill J in Australian Securities Commission v Aust Home Investments Ltd [3] and have been cited with approval [4] : 
 
 (1) Where neither party desires to proceed with litigation the court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceedings by making a cost order. (2) It will rarely, if ever, be appropriate, where there has been no trial on the merits, for a court determining how the costs of the proceeding should be borne to endeavour to determine for itself the case on the merits or, as it might be put, to determine the outcome of a hypothetical trial. This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue. (3) In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate, however, for the court to determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them. (4) In a particular case it might be appropriate for the court in its discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior to the commencement of the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation. (5) Where the proceedings terminate after interlocutory relief has been granted, the court may taken into account the fact that interlocutory relief has been granted [case references omitted]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] VSC 237">19 In Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd, [3] Hill J enumerated five principles to guide the exercise of the court's discretion in determining whether to grant costs where a proceeding has been discontinued without final hearing. Those principles have been adopted on numerous occasions. [4] </sentence>
