<citphrase id="cp8.19" type=cited from="[1979] FCA 85">trade practices act 1974 (cth), s. 45d (1). the appellant, tillmanns butcheries pty. ltd. ("tillmanns"), was a wholesale and retail butcher carrying on business in canberra and queanbeyan. the first-named respondent, the australasian meat industry employees' union ("the union") was an organization of employees including employees of wholesale and retail butchers and employees in abattoirs. the third, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents were the president, secretary and two organizers of the union respectively. in december 1977 two of the respondents entered tillmannss' shop in queanbeyan and asked to see the employees. the request was refused by tillmanns' managing director because it was neither smoko nor lunchtime. the union retaliated by imposing a black ban upon tillmanns' shops. at that time canberra abattoir pty. ltd. ("canberra abattoir"), a company which conducted an abattoir in the australian capital territory, held for tillmanns thirty-two cattle awaiting slaughter and the carcasses of twenty head of cattle and seventeen pigs. as a result of the black ban by the union the live cattle were not slaughtered for some weeks and the carcasses were released to tillmanns only about a week later to avoid deterioration. the appellant instituted an action in the federal court of australia seeking an injunction and damages under ss. 80 and 82 in relation to s. 45d of the trade practices act 1974 ("the act ") alleging that the respondents acted in concert to prevent supplies of meat to tillmanns in breach of s. 45d of the act . the trial judge declined to find that the respondents' conduct had the relevant effect and refused to award damages or to grant an injunction. he stated in his judgment, inter alia, that the plaintiff (appellant) was not entitled to argue that the conduct complained of would be likely to cause substantial loss where the means of proving whether in fact it did cause substantial loss were in its power. the appellant appealed to the full court of the federal court of australia against this judgment claiming that an injunction should have been ordered.  held: per curiam</citphrase>

<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FamCAFC 240">Section 117B(2) allows the court, by order, to vary some of the consequences which otherwise flow automatically from s 117B(1), namely by ordering that no interest be paid or by varying the rate, or the date from which it becomes payable. The wording suggests that s 117B(2) offers a divergence from the effect of s 117B(1) and thus limits its operation by working as an exception. We are also of the view that as an exception, s 117B(2) shifts the onus onto the party seeking to take advantage of the exception: see Rural Export &amp; Trading (WA) Pty Ltd v Hahneuser [2007] FCA 1535 ; (2007) 243 ALR 356 per Gray ACJ at [65]. The discretion conferred by s 117B(2) of the Act is extremely wide. However, in our view it "enables such lower or higher rate of interest to be determined as the interests of justice in a particular case may require": see G ould and Another v Vaggelas and Others .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 678">The nature and history of the proceeding
 In a judgment delivered on 4 October 2007, Rural Export &amp; Trading (WA) Pty Ltd v Hahnheuser [2007] FCA 1535 (2007) 243 ALR 356 , I dismissed the application of both applicants in this proceeding. Each of the applicants claimed relief of a declaratory and injunctive nature, as well as damages, in respect of an alleged contravention by the respondent, Mr Hahnheuser, of s 45DB of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Trade Practices Act "). When the proceeding was instituted, there was a second respondent, Animal Liberation SA Inc. I also dismissed by consent claims by both applicants against the second respondent, leaving Mr Hahnheuser as the only respondent. Both applicants' claims were in respect of a delay in the export of a shipment of live sheep from the Port of Portland aboard the MV Al Shuwaikh , destined for the Middle East. The delay occurred because Mr Hahnheuser, in concert with other people, entered a feedlot in which the sheep were held prior to being loaded on the vessel, and placed shredded ham in food and water containers, from which the sheep were intended to feed and drink. This caused a delay in the grant of a permit for the export of the sheep. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCAFC 156">2 The primary judge found that the activity of Mr Hahnheuser and his collaborators was engaged in for a dominant purpose which was "substantially related to environmental protection" within the meaning of s 45DD(3)(a) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth): Rural Export &amp; Trading (WA) Pty Ltd v Hahnheuser [2007] FCA 1535 ; (2007) 243 ALR 356 at [70] - [71]. He found that Mr Hahnheuser, as he had said in his interviews, was trying to stop the sheep in the two feed lots from being loaded aboard the Al Shuwaikh for export to the Middle East. The primary judge also found that these actions prevented the export of the 1,694 sheep in the feed lot into which the contaminant was introduced and substantially hindered the export of sheep which were in an adjacent paddock within the meaning of s 45DB(1). But, he found that the dominant purpose of Mr Hahnheuser was to protect the sheep from the suffering that he perceived they would undergo if they were shipped to the Middle East and that this was within the meaning of "environmental protection" in s 45DD(3). The primary judge also found that the onus was on an applicant under s 45DB(1) to prove that the respondent did not have a defence under s 45DD(3)(a). That is to say, the respondent did not have, as the dominant purpose for which he or she engaged in the impugned conduct, a purpose substantially related to environmental protection. </sentence>
