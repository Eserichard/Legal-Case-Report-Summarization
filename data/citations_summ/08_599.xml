<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 504">Moreover I note that in SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 599 Middelton J suggested that in a case where the Tribunal obtained evidence at the request of an applicant, the Tribunal did not " invite " any person to give additional information pursuant to s.424(2) of the Act. On that approach there was no invitation. No failure to comply with s.424(2) or the obligations that flow therefrom is established in this case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 217">

 
 [62] Whatever the scope of the Tribunal's obligations it is not required to consider criteria for an application never made. ... 

 
In MZXLB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1588 at [14] , Finkelstein J referred to NABE and observed that " (t)here is no precise standard for determining when an issue is 'raised squarely', but it is clear the tribunal is obliged to consider any claim that is apparent on the face of the material before it ". See also: SZEIV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798 at [30] to [31] and [56] to [57] per Bennett J; SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 599 ; Kasupene v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1609. That which is not to be permitted is for a claimant to " reformulate his claims on an ex post facto basis ": SZLWI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1330 at [23] , 171 FCR 134 at 140 per Gilmour J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCA 175">It is unnecessary for present purposes to resolve whether the written submission accurately expresses the basis upon which any discretion should be exercised or whether the more difficult task is the application of any discretion to the facts. Reservation is also presently expressed as to whether the present case is in any way analogous to the facts before the Full Court in SZKGF . There the question was whether an incorrect postcode upon correspondence, which was in any event received, constituted jurisdictional error. The delay of over seven years in SZIQB , and the other conduct of the claimant in that case, also seem far removed from the present case. Reference may also be made to the observations of Middleton J in SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 599 at [53] to [54] where His Honour indicated that relief may have been refused for a breach of s 441A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FMCA 1596">From the transcript it appears that no oath or affirmation was administered. The witness's evidence therefore may not have been obtained under s 427 of the Act and s 424 may have been the source of power. If so, it might be that the evidence was obtained in breach of s 424(3) --- see SZKJT v MIC [2008] FMCA 876 at 50-59, of SZGBI v MIC [2008] FCA 599 at [32] . [27] The third issue under s 424 arises because the Tribunal emailed a request to Qi Wen, the editor of a Falun Gong newspaper (CB 108). The request was for the phone number for the organiser of the Campsie practice site and was thus a request for additional information.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 1484">Also, it was through her that her mother's voluntary attendance was organised --- but no information relevant to the review was sought (or obtained) from the mother over the phone. Further, the mother had been the subject of a request from the applicant that she be required to give evidence. [3] In the telephone conversation, the spouse and her mother were simply agreeing to come to the Tribunal on another occasion to be interviewed. That did not involve the Tribunal exercising, or purporting to exercise, any power under section 359 which SZKTI might suggest may have required the procedure in section 359(3) to be followed. So too with respect to the aunt.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2008] FMCA 1322">The approach taken in relation to failures to comply with s.424A and other procedural fairness obligations in Part 4 , Division 7 of the Migration Act is of assistance. In that respect, the first respondent referred to the decision of Middleton J in SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 599. In that case it was contended that there was a failure by a Tribunal to comply with s.441A of the Act because the Tribunal did not invite witnesses who attended the Tribunal hearing to give evidence in the prescribed manner. The Tribunal had decided to take written evidence from the witnesses rather than oral evidence. This was held not to be an invitation to give additional information within s.424(2). It was also unsuccessfully argued that there was a breach of s.424 on the basis that the Tribunal failed to have regard to evidence obtained. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2008] FMCA 876">In relation to the questioning during the hearing of the friend of the applicant's father-in-law, the Minister makes the further submissions: That the current circumstances can be distinguished from the circumstances in SZKTI in that the information in that case was sought outside the Tribunal hearing. The Minister relies on SZKCQ at [49] and [51] to submit that the Tribunal's obligations under ss.424(2) and (3), and 424B do not apply to information which is provided by way of evidence or argument in an oral hearing, and that s.424 "clearly operates outside the environment of the oral hearing itself". In this regard, the Minister also relies on what was said in SZMBS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 847 (" SZMBS ") at [24]-[25] per Driver FM. That s.429A of the Act was a source of the power of the Tribunal to act as it did, and that section empowers the Tribunal to allow the giving of evidence by any person by telephone. That the Court "might also consider" that s.426(2) of the Act authorised the Tribunal to take oral evidence from the father-in-law's friend. In this regard, the first respondent refers to T 12 to T 14, and T 16, for the submission "that the applicant wanted evidence to be taken from the friend". In support of the argument that s.426(2) of the Act supplied this authority, the first respondent refers to SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 599 (" SZGBI ") at [6]-[7], [23]-[37], and SZMBS at [25].  At [48] the Full Court found that the Tribunal drew an adverse inference against the applicant based on what was said to be the author's "superficial knowledge" of the applicant's profile in China and his "'understanding' that the appellant [applicant] had been a Christian there". At [50]: "[w]hile the tribunal was at liberty to choose among the methods provided Div 4 of Pt 7 by which it might obtain the information sought from Mr Cheah, it was not at liberty simply to telephone him, without warning, and ask him questions". At [51] the Tribunal noted that SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 599 (" SZGBI ") was not of assistance in the circumstances of the case before it. In that case, it was held that s.424(2) did not apply where the Tribunal acted on a request by the applicant to obtain oral evidence under s.426(2). At [53]: "[i]n our opinion, if the tribunal requires additional information to be provided by a person it must follow the procedures that the Parliament has laid down to obtain that information.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1157">36 In SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 599 Middleton J drew attention to the various ways by which the Tribunal can gather information, s 424(2) and (3) being but one of them. The other methods to which his Honour referred, namely s 426 (witnesses called at applicant's request), s 427 (witnesses summoned by Tribunal) and those heard by resort to the Tribunal's general power to obtain and receive evidence without coercive force if a person is willing to give evidence. In those cases there are no formalities of the variety in s 424(2) and (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FMCA 847">The Tribunal is empowered by s.427(1)(a) to take evidence on oath or affirmation and is empowered to administer such an oath or affirmation to a person "appearing" at a hearing [33] . I do not regard the reference to "appearing" as requiring a personal attendance [34] . In SZGBI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [35] his Honour Middleton J dealt with an oral request by applicants to take evidence from a particular person [36] . The Tribunal received written evidence after the hearing [37] . The Court found that in those circumstances s.424(2) was not engaged [38] .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] FCAFC 83">51 After judgment was reserved, the Minister drew our attention to the decision of Middleton J given the following day: SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 599. He held that s 424(2) did not apply where the tribunal had acted on a request by the applicants for review that it obtain oral evidence from two persons named by them as persons from whom they wished it to obtain evidence under s 426(2). In those circumstances we do not find that decision of assistance.</sentence>
