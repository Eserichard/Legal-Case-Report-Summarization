Ultimately, the cases referred to by the applicant stand for the principle that, in order to constitute jurisdictional error, an alleged failure to consider evidence must amount to a failure to 'truly ... engage with the claim as presented by the visa applicant. ' [4] Another way of phrasing this principle is that the alleged failure to consider evidence must have resulted in the second respondent failing to consider an integer of the applicant's claim. [5] Importantly, even where the second respondent makes 'an error of fact based on a misunderstanding of evidence or even overlooking an item of evidence', [6] this is not sufficient to constitute jurisdictional error. Even where an issue was raised which, 'if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the [second respondent's] review of the delegate's decision' and that issue was not dealt with expressly in the second respondent's published reasons, there is no necessary implication that the issue was overlooked by the second respondent --- only a possible inference.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FMCA 535">Counsel for the applicant submitted however that in this case the Tribunal's failure to have regard to corroborative material constituted a failure to have regard to relevant considerations. Such an approach was said to be consistent with SZLGP and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2009) 181 FCR 113 ; [2009] FCA 1470 in which Logan J rejected a contention that jurisdictional error consisting of a failure to have regard to relevant considerations required demonstration that a whole aspect of a visa applicant's case had been overlooked, not just a particular document (at [42] --- [43] and [53]). His Honour stated at [43] " I do not accept that the basis for this type of jurisdictional error is as confined as the Minister has propounded or that regard to the cases cited [ WAIJ and NAJT ] bears this out. Rather, each of these cases offers but another example of a procedural fairness error on the part of the Tribunal in failing truly to engage with the claim as presented by the visa applicant.

In response to that letter, my associate advised the Minister's solicitors that I was disinclined to decide whether the appeal should be heard by a Full Court without first giving the first and second respondents an opportunity to be heard on that question.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FMCA 323">However, whether this ground is intended to be a contention that there was a failure by the Tribunal to have regard to a relevant consideration or, as seems probable, a contention that the Tribunal failed to " engage with the...claim " of the visa applicant in the sense considered by Logan J in SZLGP and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2009) 181 FCR 113 ; [2009] FCA 1470 , the difficulty facing the applicant is that the Tribunal determined whether it was satisfied that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis that he was detained and released in April 2007. If the Tribunal's reasons for decision had not considered the applicant's claims on the basis that he was arrested and detained for holding an unregistered religious gathering at his home (albeit not a Recovery Church gathering), a significant issue would have arisen in relation to the Tribunal's failure to consider material corroborative of his claim to have been detained. However, critically, (consistent with the documents referred to in this ground) for reasons which it gave and which are not affected by the material in question, the Tribunal found that even if it accepted that the applicant had been arrested and briefly detained in Beijing in April 2007 because he was holding an unregistered religious gathering at his home, it did not accept that he faced a real chance of persecution if he returned to China now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. Having rejected the applicant's claim that he was arrested and questioned about being a member of the Recovery Church, the Tribunal's findings in that context, including that it did not believe that the applicant was physically abused in detention, were not based on the documents in question, but rather on matters such as his failure to refer to injuries or hospitalisation in the medical examination form completed as part of his protection visa application, implausibilities in his evidence about how he obtained release without charge and the fact that he subsequently returned to Fujian Province and was able to practise his religion there and travel to and from Russia without any difficulty at all. On that basis the Tribunal found that the applicant was briefly detained and questioned about the gatherings at his home and that he was subsequently released without charge. It was satisfied that the applicant " was of no further interest to the authorities after his arrest in April 2007 ". Hence, while the Tribunal accepted that the applicant was a Christian and a member of a house church (but not a member of the Local Recovery Church), it found that he could return to his home province and practise his religion and that he would not face a real chance of persecution on the basis of his religion. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] RRTA 278">The Tribunal stated that the particulars of the information were as follows: 
 
 'As discussed at the hearing on [date] March 2010, you produced to the second Tribunal a letter dated [date] March 2007 from [Business A] stating that the Farm Board had decided to dismiss you, [the applicant], from the Board and all your positions on the Farm, to sell all your shares and to confiscate them. At the hearing on [date] November 2008 you invited the Tribunal to investigate this document. The judge who remitted the matter back to the Tribunal held that the Tribunal had been obliged to telephone the fish farm to inquire whether there had been a forfeiture or confiscation of your shares in the fish farm or perhaps just as to why you were no longer employed there: see SZLGP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1470 at [50] per Logan J. As discussed at the hearing on [date] March 2010, in February 2010 the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade attempted to contact the fish farm several times without success. They spoke to an officer at the Fuqing Industrial Commercial Administration Bureau who told them that the business registration had been revoked by the Bureau in February 2009 as the business had failed to renew its registration in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Justice Logan held that the Tribunal had been obliged to telephone [Business A] to inquire 'as to whether there had been a forfeiture or confiscation of an interest which the male Appellant had at that farm or perhaps just as to why he was no longer employed there': see SZLGP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1470 at [50] per Logan J. The matter is now before the Tribunal pursuant to the orders of the Federal Court. Since it has been held that it is incumbent on the Tribunal in such a case to make it clear on the face of its reasons how it has discharged its obligation to reconsider the matter according to law - see SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 321 at [21] per Reeves J - I note that the Tribunal has made the inquiries which Justice Logan held that it had been obliged to make as referred to in paragraph 49 below. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] NSWADTAP 19">9 Most questions in relation to factual findings do not constitute questions of law. Not even a perverse finding of fact gives rise to an error of law: Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd (1985) 4 NSWLR 139. It is only where a decision maker acts without any evidence or without probative evidence that a question of law arises: Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163 per Spigelman CJ (Mason P agreeing) at 188-89. These principles were explained in Ormwave Pty Ltd v Smith [2007] NSWCA 210 at [14] per Beazley JA, with whom Santow and Ipp JJA agreed. Similarly, findings as to credibility are findings of fact, 'par excellence' and are entrusted to the Tribunal alone to make: SZLPN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 202 per Flick J citing Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 at [67] , [2000] HCA 1 ; 168 ALR 407 at 423; SZLGP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1470 at [34] . </sentence>

No jurisdictional error, it may be noted, was there found by Allsop J. Jurisdictional error was, however, found by Logan J in SZLGP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1470. His Honour was satisfied that there was " error on the part of the Tribunal in failing truly to engage with the claim as presented by the visa applicant ". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2010] FCA 202">In the present proceeding, the reasons for decision of the Tribunal dated 9 June 2009 record that it did not regard the now Appellant as " a witness of truth ".

Reference was made in the reasons of the Tribunal to the Tribunal Member putting to the now Appellant the fact that the claims made in his protection visa application " were very different from his claims before the Tribunal ".

The task of judicially reviewing, on application, a decision of the Tribunal is consigned to the Federal Magistrates Court, not to this Court. There is authority that a grant of leave is necessary to agitate on appeal grounds which were not raised below. That leave is to be granted only where it is expedient in the interests of justice so to do. I canvassed authorities in respect of that proposition in my judgment in SZLGP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1470 at [25] and [26]. I shall not repeat what is there stated. </sentence>
