<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] VSC 4">
 
 22 The interests of shareholders have, in some schemes, been protected by provisions for the cash component to be paid by the acquirer into a trust account prior to the scheme implementation date. [23] Nevertheless, the use of a trust arrangement is only one means of reducing the risk to shareholders of non-performance by the acquiring company. The authorities indicate that this is not the only method regarded as appropriate for achieving this result. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] VSC 423">
 
 31 I am satisfied that the provisions of cl 5 of the Scheme satisfy these requirements: 
(a) as to the Cash Consideration, cl 5.3 provides for Aegis to deposit the Cash Consideration into a trust account operated by Mitchell for the benefit of those Scheme Participants who have elected to receive cash consideration no later than two business days before the implementation date; 
(b) as to the Share Consideration, cl 4.2 provides that the transfer of the Scheme Shares to Aegis on the implementation date is subject to cl 5.5 (amongst other clauses), which provides that Aegis must issue the New Aegis Shares on the implementation date and enter the name of each Scheme Participant in the Aegis share register in respect of the New Aegis Shares which that Scheme Participant is entitled to receive. [17] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] VSC 560">[16] The deed poll also provides in cl.1.3 that the covenant may be enforced by any scheme shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] NSWSC 133">3 On 19 January 2007, McDougall J made orders under s.411(1) for the convening of a meeting of the members of the plaintiff for the purpose of considering the proposed scheme of arrangement. His Honour subsequently delivered reasons for making those orders: Re Green's Foods Limited [2007] NSWSC 43. Those reasons touched upon the principal matters to be considered upon such an application. His Honour noted in particular the arrangements that had been made or were proposed to deal with the "credit risk" or "performance risk" issue which had been the subject of comment in a number of recent cases, in particular the decision of Gyles J in Re Tempo Services Limited [2005] FCA 410 ; (2005) 53 ACSR 523 (see also Re Tribeca Learning Ltd [2006] FCA 356 (Jacobson J); Re Webcentral Group Ltd [2006] FCA 937 (Lindgren J); Re Promina Group Ltd [2006] FCA 1772 (Gyles J)). McDougall J noted the joint trust account provision that had been adopted to ensure that members of the plaintiff were not at risk as to the unavailability of the funds that would become due to them for their shares. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] FCA 84">

7 Another reason for not departing from the approach of Lindgren J in WebCentral , is that in his reasons given when his Honour made orders for the convening of meetings in respect of that scheme of arrangement ( WebCentral Group Limited, in the matter of WebCentral Group Limited [2006] FCA 937 at [14] ), his Honour referred to the fact that Gyles J of this Court, and Barrett J of the New South Wales Supreme Court, had also taken the same approach to the 'no encumbrances' clause.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] FCA 1203">
 1 The plaintiff ("WCG") applies under s 411(6) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act ") for an order approving a scheme of arrangement between WCG and its members ("the Scheme"). The first court hearing took place on 14 July 2006 (see WebCentral Group Limited, in the matter of WebCentral Group Limited [2006] FCA 937). I then made an order under s 411(1) of the Act that WCG convene a meeting ("Scheme Meeting") of its shareholders ("WebCentral Shareholders") for the purpose of their considering, and, if thought fit, agreeing (with or without modification) to the Scheme. </sentence>
