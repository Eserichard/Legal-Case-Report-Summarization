<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 313">Not all of Granitgard's allegations formed part of its case as originally formulated (qv Granitgard Pty Ltd ACN 007 427 590 v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd ACN 093 837 337 [2008] FCA 55). Rather, Granitgard sought to amend its case shortly prior to the originally allocated, June 2008 trial dates. In an application brought on while I was on leave it persuaded another judge, in the circumstances, to grant it leave further to amend its statement of claim and to vacate those trial dates (qv Granitgard Pty Ltd ACN 007 427 590 v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd ACN 093 837 337 [2008] FCA 865 A yet further amendment of Termicide's case was later made after a grant of leave by me in October 2008). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 82">The application is made at a time when both the case for Granitgard and the case for the Respondent, hereafter Termicide, have each closed. Submissions in the case are yet to be made and, obviously enough, judgment has not yet been given. The proceedings were commenced on 19 September 2007. In February last year, a trial was fixed to commence on 23 June. Interlocutory directions were made, which required Granitgard to file its evidence in chief by 18 April 2008, in anticipation of the trial then occurring in June. On 10 June, Granitgard made application for the trial dates to be vacated. That proved necessary, in light of a proposal which Granitgard had made to amend its statement of claim. That application was successful: see Granitgard Proprietary Limited v Termicide Pest Control Proprietary Limited [2008] FCA 865 (Collier J). </sentence>
