<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 104">116 In Commonwealth v Westwood [2007] FCA 1282 ; (2007) 163 FCR 71 , an Australian Army officer was prosecuted for two offences arising from his alleged loss of certain classified material. One issue that arose was whether the Director of Military Prosecutions, who (along with the Commonwealth) sought declarations that would have the effect of overturning a decision by the Judge Advocate, was "the Commonwealth" for the purposes of s 39B(IA)(a) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). That section confers original jurisdiction upon the Federal Court in any matter in which "the Commonwealth" is seeking an injunction or declaration. </sentence>
