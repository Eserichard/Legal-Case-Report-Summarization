<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] APO 16">LTS noted that the delegate of the Commissioner in Euro-Celtique considered that "all other factors being equal, there is no difference between a pharmaceutical being delivered orally from one delivered dermally". LTS distinguished their product from that refused an extension in Euro-Celtique, because it was not a "transdermal delivery system" and "when claim 1 is read in the context of the specification and claims as a whole, the backing layer and the protective layer are conceptually no different to the binding features of a tablet, or a capsule which contains a new drug". In the hearing, Counsel for the patentee also compared the present formulation to that in Pharmacia Italia SpA v Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 305 which granted an extension to a patent claiming a ready-to-use injectable solution comprising the active ingredient dissolved in a solvent, in combination with an acid. Counsel noted that the injectable product must have been in a container, but this did not prevent an extension of term being given in that case. LTS's claimed product is in the same area, only distinguished by the fact that the container (i.e. Properly understood, the patent claims a "new and inventive product alone", which the Full Court confirmed is the only type of claim that is to be the subject of extension rights. ( Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH v Commissioner of Patents [2001] FCA 647 at [17] ) 
 
 
"NEUPRO &reg; comprises the known active ingredient (rotigotine) and an acrylate or silicone based non-aqueous polymer adhesive compound into which rotigotine free base is able to be dissolved to enable transdermal application. The combination of the stated elements comprises the new "pharmaceutical substance per se" (not being limited to the active ingredient alone: Prejay Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2002] FCA 881 per Heerey J in which his Honour quoted the Patent Office Manual, upheld on appeal [2003] FCAFC 77 ; Pharmacia Italia SpA v Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 305 at [107] )". LTS conceded at [19] of the written submissions, that a key difficulty is the inclusion in the claims of backing and protective layers. However, at [20] "Despite the fact that the backing layer is a another physical integer, it is submitted that this does not render the claims made in the patent as extending to a method or process, of which the NEUPRO &reg; drug is a part (cf Boehringer at [17]). The meaning of the expression "pharmaceutical substance per se " in s 70(2)(a) has been considered by the Federal Court in Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH v Commissioner of Patents [2001] FCA 647 , Prejay Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2003] FCAFC 77 and in Pharmacia Italia SpA v Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 305. In Boehringer at [37], the Full Court referred with approval to the submission at [34] that the introduction of the words " per se " by the 1998 amendments to the Patents Act indicated a clear intention to limit the operation of s 70 to patents disclosing and claiming a pharmaceutical substance "by or in itself, intrinsically, essentially" ( New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary ), or "taken alone; essentially; without reference to anything else" ( Butterworth's Australian Legal Dictionary ).

 16. The meaning of the expression "pharmaceutical substance per se " in s 70(2)(a) has been authoritatively considered by the Federal Court in Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH v Commissioner of Patents [2001] FCA 647 (' Boehringer '), Prejay Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2003] FCAFC 77 (' Prejay ') and most recently in Pharmacia Italia SpA v Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 305 (' Pharmacia '). In Boehringer , the Full Court referred with approval, at [34] and [37], to the submission of the respondent that the introduction of the words " per se " by the 1998 amendments to the Patents Act indicated a clear intention, on the part of the legislature, to limit the operation of s 70 to patents disclosing and claiming a pharmaceutical substance "by or in itself, intrinsically, essentially" ( New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary ), or "taken alone; essentially; without reference to anything else" ( Butterworth's Australian Legal Dictionary ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2007] APO 2">5. Subject to the payment of renewal fees, the normal term of the patent was due to expire on 19 June 2006. However, a request for an extension of term of the patent under s 70 of the Act was filed on 14 March 2001 together with an application for an extension of time for filing that request under s 223. The basis for the request for extension of term was the inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) of Zavedos, idarubicin hydrochloride 5mg/5mL injection vial which was subject to an ARTG registration commencing on 19 August 1999. The extension of term was granted by the delegate on 6 April 2004 and 19 June 2011 was entered in the Register as the date for the extension of term of the patent. Subsequently the grant of the extension of term by the Commissioner was considered in Pharmacia Italia SpA v Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 305 where Justice Weinberg found that the invention claimed in claim 1 was directed to a pharmaceutical substance per se as required by s 70(2) of the Act and consequently dismissed an application for judicial review. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2006] APO 18">
 15. Ms Howard placed weight on the fact that s 70(2) refers to the pharmaceutical substance " per se ". This has been considered by the Federal Court in a series of cases: Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH v Commissioner of Patents [2001] FCA 647 ; 112 FCR 595 (' Boehringer '), Prejay Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2003] FCAFC 77 ; 57 IPR 424 (' Prejay ') and Pharmacia Italia SpA v Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 305 (' Pharmacia '). It is clear that for a substance to fall within s 70(2)(a) it must itself be the subject of a claim of the patent. In the present case, compliance with s 70(2) is not in dispute.</sentence>
