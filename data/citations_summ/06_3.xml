Although the Applicant has not specifically pleaded this issue, it appears that he is attempting to submit that the Tribunal was required to address the practical realities that he and his wife would face if they were to relocate: Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1994] FCA 1253 ; (1994) 52 FCR 437 , SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 40 , SZFDV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 41 , NAIZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC per Branson J at [22] and North J at [73], Walt v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCAFC 2 at [45] , SZAIX v Minister for Immigration, and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 3 , SZBJI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 216.

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FMCA 875">Firstly, in AZAAR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship &amp; Refugee Review Tribunal , [13] Finn J at [5] --- [10] set out what his Honour described as the "legal setting" for such appeals. Apart from formally being bound by his Honour's comments, respectfully I adopt them. I set them out below: There has been systematic, recent authoritative analysis of when conduct giving rise to a well founded fear of serious harm at the hands of a non-State actor may constitute persecution because of the unwillingness or inability of the State (or State agents) to discharge its obligation to protect its citizens: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 222 CLR 1 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 48 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 ; Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000] UKHL 37 ; [2001] 1 AC 489 ; see also SZAIX v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448. I need only note the following for present purposes. It is drawn from the above authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FMCA 852">The argument in response to the s.424A invitation did not have to be addressed specifically in the manner contended for in these proceedings. The Tribunal is not required to refer to every piece of evidence in its reasons (see WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 at [46] and SZAIX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448 at [33] ). It dealt with the relevant issue, which was the question of whether the applicant, as an ordinary supporter or organiser who was not a member of Parliament, was at risk of serious harm at the hands of pro-Syrian forces. It is well-established that the choice and interpretation of country information and the weight to be given to such information is a matter for the Tribunal alone (see NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 at [11] --- [13]). Moreover the Tribunal considered whether there was evidence to suggest that perpetrators of the campaign of violence against anti-Syrian law-makers " are interested in targeting individuals with anti-Syrian political beliefs or activists or organisers of anti-Syrian rallies and other anti-Syrian activities" but found no such evidence . Nor was it able to find any evidence to support the applicant's claim about co-operation of Lebanese authorities with Syrians as contended. The Tribunal did accept that people in Lebanon faced some risk of harm " as a result of sectarian violence or war", but considered that this was not a risk of serious harm faced by the applicant by virtue of a Convention reason, but rather a " generalised, undifferentiated risk". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FMCA 844">It is a jurisdictional error only to look at the official position in Indonesia rather than the actual position faced by the review applicant ( SZAIX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [11] per Madgwick J at [45]-[46] &amp; [48]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FCA 912">There has been systematic, recent authoritative analysis of when conduct giving rise to a well founded fear of serious harm at the hands of a non-State actor may constitute persecution because of the unwillingness or inability of the State (or State agents) to discharge its obligation to protect its citizens: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 48 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 ; Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000] UKHL 37 ; [2001] 1 AC 489 ; see also SZAIX v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448. I need only note the following for present purposes. It is drawn from the above authorities. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2009] FMCA 569">It was suggested that the application of this test was illustrated by the fact that in NAIZ the Full Court of the Federal Court held that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by failing to give consideration to the practical realities of accommodation for the applicant if she returned to her home country, while in SZAIX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448 at [55] --- [64] the Tribunal was found to have failed to acknowledge the major difficulties of a psychological and physical nature which would confront the applicant if she returned to her home country, and hence misapplied the relocation test. Reference was also made to SZBJI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 216 in which Allsop J was said to have held that the Tribunal failed to address the practical reasonableness of relocation.  The applicant submitted that the Tribunal was required to address the practical realities that would face an applicant if he or she relocated (see Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1994] FCA 1253 ; (1994) 52 FCR 437 , SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] HCA 40 ; (2007) 233 CLR 18 , SZFDV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] HCA 41 ; (2007) 233 CLR 51 , NAIZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 37 at [22] per Branson J and [73] per North J, WALT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCAFC 2 at [45] , SZAIX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448 and SZBJI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 216). It was submitted that this entailed the Tribunal giving consideration to an applicant's personal history, including his language skills, age, education, health, familial connections, employment and demonstrated ability to live independently elsewhere than in the locality of origin (see WALT at [45]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] FMCA 198">Such assessments as were made by the Tribunal of the responses provided inherently involved part of the Tribunal's decision-making processes. The rules of procedural fairness: "do not require the decision-maker to disclose what he is minded to decide so that the parties may have a further opportunity of criticising his mental processes before he reaches a final decision: F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 at 369 per Lord Diplock. Procedural fairness does not require giving to an Applicant a running commentary on his prospects of success and warning him of every reason why his claims might not be thought sufficient to justify the relief sought: Applicant S 214 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 375 at [32] , [2006] FCA 375 ; [2006] FCA 375 ; 90 ALD 632 at 641 per Edmonds J. An appeal has been dismissed: Applicant S 214/2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCAFC 166. The first respondent submits that the applicant's construction of the section 360 obligation is misconceived and [this] ground of review should be dismissed. At best they were items of oral evidence. Accordingly, even if the Tribunal failed to make reference to them, it is not required to refer to every piece of evidence in its reasons: see WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 at [46]. As Madgwick J stated in SZAIX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 3 at [33] : The Tribunal was under no obligation to recite every piece of evidence before it, and especially not required to recite evidence it found unconvincing on an issue. The Tribunal plainly noted the various reasons given by the applicant for the lack of documentation (CB 324 [28]) but ultimately found the lack of evidence concerning (CB 330 at [67]. That finding was open to it and does not constitute a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FMCA 175">I accept that this reasoning might suggest error of law. It would have been erroneous for the Tribunal to have characterised the applicant's fear of political persecution by Chinese authorities as not having a Convention nexus, due to a non-Convention motive of the instigator of such persecution (cf. Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 48 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 at [30] - [31] , discussed by Madgwick J in SZAIX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448 at [37] - [41] ). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FMCA 230">Counsel for the Applicant, Mr Reynolds, submitted that the Tribunal did not refer to or explain why the IELTS certificate submitted by the Applicant did not satisfy item 572.223(2)(a)(i) of Schedule 5A. He submitted that if by its finding the Tribunal meant that the Applicant did not submit evidence of an IELTS test at all, then it engaged in jurisdictional error by failing to take into account a relevant consideration. He submitted that the words used by the Tribunal and the absence of any "active intellectual process" mean that the Court should infer that the document was not considered at all, which amounts to jurisdictional error (see NAJT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [12] at [212]-[213]; see also SZAIX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [13] ). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs15" from="[2008] FCA 1489">5 As to the dislocation to the court and the efficient use of judicial resources, I express the same concerns Justice Madgwick did in SZAIX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448 at [68] . However, like his Honour, I consider that the interests of justice in allowing the appellant to pursue this appeal outweigh those considerations. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2008] FMCA 960">The Tribunal did not suggest that the applicant would have to live "discreetly" in other parts of India (see SZATV at [32] per Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ); rather, it found that the applicant could freely express his political opinion in other parts of India. The Tribunal did consider whether as a matter of practical reality it was reasonable for the applicant to relocate: see SZAIX v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 3 per Magwick J at [63]; SZIED v Minister for Immigration [2007] FCA 1347 per Moore J. The Tribunal considered the applicant's business, the languages he spoke, his levels of education and his ability to live and work in other countries. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs17" from="[2007] FCA 2050">35 The appellant's third and final submission was that in considering relocation the Tribunal member failed to consider the appellant's symptoms of post-traumatic stress and the difficulties he would experience in terms of relocation in view of those symptoms. I was referred to NAIZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 37 and SZAIX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Anor [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2007] FMCA 1382">13. In support of the contention that a failure to consider an aspect of the applicant's claims leads to jurisdictional error, Mr Turner relied on Htun v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 at [42] and SZAIX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 3 (" SZAIX ") at [45] and [51].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2007] FMCA 965">However, I note that subsequently, in SZGPZ v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 683 at [25] - [26] , Collier J. followed Applicant A2 of 2002 , Applicant M29 and Applicant M211 of 2003 , rather than Applicants M160/2003 . 82. I further note that there are some decisions of this Court, (including two which the applicant has relied upon): NAGG , SZHEH at [36]-[41] and SZEEF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 661 (relying on Gararth v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 316) where the explanation of pursuing a "s.417 request" was found to be acceptable in explaining delay. 83. While each of the circumstances in each of those cases can, in my view, be distinguished from the circumstances before the Court now, to the extent that these cases appear to take a different view to what was set out in M211 of 2003 , with respect, I take the view that M211 of 2003 is binding on this Court and plainly should be followed. Even further, it found that he could reasonably relocate away from East Java if he feared harm there as claimed from "local people". 28. In written submissions filed subsequent to the hearing on 8 March 2007, the applicant made reference to SZAIX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448 (" SZAIX" ). Mr. Anthony sought to draw a parallel between what was found in the circumstances relevant to that case, and what was subsequently found with the circumstances before the Court now. I do not agree, given what I have already set out above, that the applicant's claim to membership of a particular social group was expressly articulated before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs20" from="[2007] FCA 802">21 
 
As the merits of the proposed grounds of appeal are relevant to decide whether leave to appeal should be granted (see VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] - [48]), it is appropriate first to address the proposed grounds of appeal to assess their merits. Realistically, as counsel for the first respondent acknowledged, if those grounds of appeal are likely to result in success on the appeal and the quashing of the decision of the Tribunal, given the significant implications to the appellant of the present decision of the Tribunal which would have him return to Bangladesh, there would be strong reason to allow the proposed grounds of appeal to be pursued: cf SZAIX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 3 at [66] ; NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51.

<sentence id="cs21" from="[2007] FMCA 643">Finally, there is nothing in the applicant's evidence that would indicate that she was maintaining she had any particular problems because she was an Iraqi woman as opposed to just a woman in Syria. The Tribunal, whilst having a duty to consider any formulation of a claim that can be extracted from the available evidence (see Htun v Minister for Immigration [2001] FCA 1802 ; (2001) 194 ALR 244 at [7] per Merkel J, and at [42] per Allsop J) is not obliged to make findings in relation to claims upon which no evidence whatsoever has been advanced. In SZAIX v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 3 , Madgwick J determined that the Tribunal had a duty to consider any formulation of a claim that is either " clearly and expressly so asserted " (at [50]), or a claim that "' clearly arises' on the material before a decision-maker " (at [52]). However, the Tribunal is not required to consider claims which do not arise from the materials before it. This was enunciated in NABE v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 219 ALR 27 at [60] , citing the decision of Selway J in SGBB v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCA 709 ; (2003) 199 ALR 364:
