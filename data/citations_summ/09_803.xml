<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCAFC 53">When a party elects as part of its offer to abandon a claim to recoverable costs (which in the circumstances must be taken to be a good claim) in the order of $123,000 or $153,000 or possibly $184,000, a real concession arises. As Finkelstein J observed in Brookfield Multiplex Limited v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd (No. 4) (" Brookfield Multiplex v ILFP" ) [2009] FCA 803 at [13] and [14]: 
 

 
 
 
 13. One can easily envisage circumstances where a "walk away' offer must be regarded as a genuine offer of compromise. Take for example a case that has progressed for some time and the party's costs are quite high.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FCA 283">An offer of compromise, properly so called does exist where a party is prepared to pay some money (albeit small) and otherwise the parties 'walk away': see Granitgard Pty Ltd v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd (No 6) [2010] FCA 381 at [22] and [23], where reference was made to the decision of Finkelstein J in Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd (No 4) [2009] FCA 803 ; and the decision of Greenwood J in Uniline Australia Ltd v SBriggs Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 920 ; (2009) 82 IPR 56. In addition, in these proceedings, it is important to remember that the respondents, by way of cross-claim, wanted positive relief by way of rectification. The respondents were offering not to press the litigation any further (which would involve associated costs and management time on the part of the applicant), if the applicant agreed to rectification. I accept that by this time, having regard to the history of the applicant's use of the trade mark, to accept the offers would have been a great step for the applicant. However, I see no basis to conclude that the offer was not a genuine attempt to bring the proceedings to an end in the way in which the public policy of O 23 r 11(6) encourages. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] FCA 278">The offer may have been "derisory" but that does not mean that it was not genuine. In Leichhardt Municipal Council v Green [2004] NSWCA 341 (" Leichhardt Municipal Council v Green ") the NSW Court of Appeal observed (at [23]) that "it is clear that an offer with no real element of compromise in it, which is designed merely to trigger the costs sanctions, will not be treated as a genuine offer of compromise". Still, as the respondent pointed out, there is no rule that a "walk away" offer can never amount to a genuine offer of compromise: Leichhardt Municipal Council v Green at [32]; Brookfield Multiplex Limited v International Litigation Funding Partners Pty Ltd (No. 4) [2009] FCA 803 at [13] and [14]; Clark v Commissioner of Taxation [2010] FCA 415 at [90] ; Granitgard Pty Ltd v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd (No. 6) [2010] FCA 381 (" Granitgard v Termicide Pest Control (No 6) ") at [22]-[23]. It all depends on the circumstances. In my view, it could not be said that the offer made in this case was one with no real element of compromise, designed merely to trigger the costs sanctions. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FMCA 1018">In circumstances where the Applicant has been wholly unsuccessful and the Respondent has made an offer more beneficial than the court order, the provision creates a presumptive or prima facie entitlement to indemnity costs in favour of the Respondent: Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pty Ltd (No.4) [2009] FCA 803 at [11] ; Olivayille Pty Ltd v Flottweg GMBH and Co KGAA (No.5) [2009] FCA 571. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 1166">Furthermore, the final outcome of the Bank's cross-claim and a comparison between that outcome and the offer of settlement must be seen in a proper perspective whatever view is taken about the position of the individual applicants. The great bulk of the proceedings was taken up with dealing with the application, rather than the cross-claim. The Bank made no offer of compromise of the application, apart from offering to bear its own costs. There is some doubt whether an offer of that kind qualifies at all as a foundation for an application for indemnity costs (see e.g. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 192 ; (2002) 201 ALR 618 at [56] , [61]; Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd (No 4) [2009] FCA 803 at [12] ) but that is an issue I do not need to determine in the present case. Although the application was dismissed, except for costs the applicants have fared no worse than the Bank proposed in relation to that part of the proceedings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 1092">So far I have proceeded on the assumption that what was contained in the three letters is an offer capable of being taken into account for costs purposes. But there are several cases which hold that an offer that a party withdraw, or withdraw and submit to a costs order, is not an offer that involves a real and genuine element of compromise and hence its rejection should not be considered unreasonable for costs purposes: see eg Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd (No 4) [2009] FCA 803 , [12]-[14]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 192 ; [2002] FCA 192 ; 201 ALR 618 , [62]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] FCA 1068">In my view, it cannot be said that the offer made by Euroz did not constitute a commercial compromise of value. It has been recognised that in certain circumstances, that an offer to forego costs could be sufficient in itself to constitute an offer of commercial value. As Finkelstein J observed in the case of Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd (No 4) [2009] FCA 803 at [13] : 
 
 Take for example a case that has progressed for some time and the parties' costs are quite high. In that event an offer to walk away may, in a business sense, be a significant offer: see for example Commissioner of Taxation v Evenfront (No 2) [2009] NSWSC 9 ; (2009) 223 FLR 28 at 31. 
 

 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2010] FCA 415">When a party elects as part of its offer to abandon a claim to recoverable costs (which in the circumstances must be taken to be a good claim) in the order of $123,000 or $153,000 or possibly $184,000, a real concession arises.

In that event an offer to walk away may, in a business sense, be a significant offer: see for example Commissioner of Taxation v Evenfont (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FCA 381">In other cases other judges have used the expression "presumptive entitlement" to describe the effect of the current O 23 r 11(6). Such cases are helpfully collected by Finkelstein J in Brookfield Multiplex Limited v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd (No 4) (Brookfield Multiplex No 4) [2009] FCA 803 at [7] . That is also (at [11]) his Honour's tentative preference as to the construction of the sub-rule, it being unnecessary in that case for him to reach any final conclusion as to its meaning and effect. " Prima facie " and "presumptive entitlement" may be and in my opinion are just different ways of stating the same proposition. So, too, is the expression "rebuttable presumption" which was favoured by Termicide in its submissions concerning the construction of the current O 23 r 11(6). </sentence>
