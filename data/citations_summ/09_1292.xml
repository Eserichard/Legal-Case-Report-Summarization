<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 136">Bell submitted that Ms Meaden's submissions in [14] and [15] above, namely, that to order particulars would be 'contrary to authority' do not withstand even cursory scrutiny. According to Bell: 
(1) They are contrary to FAI (No 1) ;
 
(2) They are contrary to what Jacobson J would have ordered, presumably after full argument, in Peter Hanne &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Village Life Ltd [2008] FCA 719 at [15] and [57];
 
(3) They are contrary to what occurred in Weimann v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 1292 at [24] , although the reasons for that order do not appear to be available. (Each of those proceedings concerned a class of group members defined by having entered into a litigation funding agreement: see Peter Hanne at [3] and Weimann v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 673 at [34] . )
 
Most importantly, according to Bell, none of the authorities cited by Ms Meaden demonstrate that it is in fact contrary to authority to provide particulars of the group members. What the cases cited by Ms Meaden, particularly Thomas v Powercor Australia , demonstrate is that in some cases the passivity of the group members' role might justify limiting the amount of involvement they have. </sentence>
