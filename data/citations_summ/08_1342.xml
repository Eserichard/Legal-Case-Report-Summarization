The same construction was given to s 430 by the then Chief Justice: [2001] HCA 30 at [10] , [2001] HCA 30 ; 206 CLR 323 at 331 to 332. Whatever uncertainty may have prevailed prior to Yusuf, notwithstanding the unambiguous terms of s 430, there now remains no uncertainty as to the proper construction of s 430 or the requirements imposed: eg. SZJOC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1342 at [20] per Graham J; SZKMS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 499 at [52] per Lander J. </sentence>
