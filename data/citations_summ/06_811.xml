<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 947">In Repatriation Commission v Butcher [2006] FCA 811 , Besanko J said at [43] that the characterisation of the type of remunerative work that a veteran was undertaking "must be made with an eye to reality, and as a matter in respect of which common sense is the proper guide": 
An unduly narrow definition may result in veterans receiving the pension at the special rate in circumstances not contemplated by the legislature. An unduly wide definition may result in veterans being refused the pension at the special rate in circumstances in which, in reality, they are not working (and thereby not receiving wages) solely because of war-caused injuries or diseases. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] AATA 823">The finding that 'remunerative work' refers to a broad field of activity rather than a specific profession or job meant, for example, in Re Holden and Repatriation Commission [2009] AATA 735 that remunerative work as a station assistant with the State Rail Authority; as a head mill-operator with Comalco; as a forklift driver, a storeman, and a picker and packer; as a security officer; as a handyman and gardener; as a trades assistant to an electrical firm; and as a cargo specialist for loading and unloading of vehicles, was classified simply as 'general unskilled work with some element of physical activity': at [13]. [4] It was conceded, however, that a broad characterisation of this kind is easier where the person has performed a range of unskilled jobs and will not always be appropriate.  In Repatriation Commission v Butcher [2006] FCA 811 , Besanko J said that the characterisation of the type of remunerative work, like the test for causation, must 'be made with an eye to reality, and as a matter in respect of which common sense is the proper guide'. [5] This broad approach to characterisation of what is 'remunerative work' was upheld on appeal by the Full Court, [6] and has been accepted by both parties to this application.  In Repatriation Commission v Butcher [2006] FCA 811 , Besanko J said that the characterisation of the type of remunerative work, like the test for causation, must 'be made with an eye to reality, and as a matter in respect of which common sense is the proper guide'. [5] This broad approach to characterisation of what is 'remunerative work' was upheld on appeal by the Full Court, [6] and has been accepted by both parties to this application. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] AATA 332">After formulating the more general characterisation of the remunerative work which Mr Butcher had previously undertaken (namely, general labouring duties involving unskilled work, process work and general driving duties), his Honour continued: 
 "I would not include driving a fork-lift in the description of general driving duties. That was employment he undertook for only a short period of time and the question is the 'substantive' or 'substantial' remunerative work the respondent has undertaken in the past. That leaves for consideration whether, in this case, the general labouring duties involving unskilled work includes tasks that required work above his head, such as fixing ceilings or cornices, or painting, or prolonged looking down, such as concrete laying or flooring work. I do not think that it does, because there is no evidence that the respondent undertook such work on a prolonged or repetitive basis for any period of time, or that he was qualified to undertake such work. " ([2006] FCA 811 at [44]) 

These further comments, which were approved by the Full Court, were not contested by either party on the hearing of the remitter. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] AATA 609">Counsel for Mr Reardon referred us to the decision of Besanko J in Repatriation Commission v Butcher [2006] FCA 811. In that case the Tribunal had referred to the remunerative work which Mr Butcher had undertaken by reference to a number of jobs which he had held in the past. The Tribunal had found that Mr Butcher's war-caused injuries were the sole cause of his incapacity to undertake some, but not all, of those jobs. The Commission appealed on the ground that the Tribunal must have reasoned that if the war-caused injuries alone prevented Mr Butcher from undertaking certain types of remunerative work which he had undertaken, then that was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of s 24(1)(c). It submitted that that reasoning involved an error of law because, to succeed, a veteran had to show that the war-caused injuries alone prevented him from carrying out all types of remunerative work which he was undertaking. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FMCA 13">In Repatriation Commission v Butcher [2006] FCA 811 Besanko J at [33] highlighted the importance of properly characterising the remunerative work that the veteran was undertaking, and was said to be unable to continue. At [37] his Honour applied to the term 'remunerative work' the description 'the type of work the veteran was undertaking or his field of remunerative activity'. At paragraph [38] his Honour expanded on this and said the issue of characterisation required the decision maker to identify the 'substantive remunerative work' that the veteran had undertaken in the past. At [42] his Honour said: "It seems to me that the determination of the type of work the veteran was undertaking, or his or her field of remunerative activity, involves a consideration of the veteran's qualifications and the work which he or she has in fact undertaken in the past. On occasions, the decision will be a relatively straightforward one, where, for example, the veteran has specialised qualifications and has only ever worked in one field of employment. In other cases, of which this is one, the decision will involve a process of characterisation and it is not necessarily resolved by simply characterising the field of remunerative activity as involving all of the particular types of employment which the veteran has undertaken. Nor will it necessarily be appropriate to include in the field of remunerative activity a particular type of employment performed some time in the past for a short period of time. " </sentence>
