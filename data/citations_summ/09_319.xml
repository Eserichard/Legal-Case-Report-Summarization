<citphrase id="cp5.35" type=cited from="[1977] FCA 10">conciliation and arbitration act 1904-1976, s. 141. the conciliation and arbitration act 1904-1976 provides by s. 140 that the rules of an organization shall not be contrary to, or fail to make a provision required by, the provisions of the act, the regulations or an award or otherwise be contrary to law. the section also provides that the rules shall not impose upon applicants for membership or members of the organization, conditions, obligations or restrictions which, having regard to the objects of the act and the purposes of registration of organizations under the act, are oppressive, unreasonable or unjust. section 141 provides by sub-s. (1) that the court may, upon complaint by any member of an organization, make an order giving directions for the performance or observance of any of the rules of the organization by any person who is under an obligation to perform or observe those rules.  the rules of an organization included amongst its objects the establishment of branches and sub-branches. rule 39 created various branches of the organization, each with full local autonomy, including the victorian branch, and by sub-r. (b) such branches might form sub-branches in their respective states. by r. 39 (c) branches and sub-branches were required to conform to the rules of the organization. rule 45 provided for the establishment by a branch of a sub-branch under the control of and subject to the instructions of the branch and by sub-r. (b), each sub-branch should elect for its management a number of named officers including a secretary.  rule 6 required, amongst other things, a period of five years' continuous membership for eligibility for nomination for election to the office of federal secretary. rule 6a made a similar provision in relation to the office of assistant federal secretary. rule 17 specified the powers and duties of the federal secretary and by sub-r. (n), the federal secretary was an ex officio member of all branch committees of management. rule 21 of the victorian branch rules provided for the conduct of a ballot of the membership on matters affecting the welfare of members, subject to the authorization of the ballot by the branch committee of management.  on the motion of the federal secretary of the organization, the committee of management of the victorian branch resolved, amongst other things, that the secretary of the geelong sub-branch should be advised as follows:  "(3) you are to account in writing within twenty-eight days of receipt of notice of this direction for all monies paid out by you since 1st january, 1970, for purposes other than wages, telephone expenses, gas, light, electricity, stationery or rent.  "(4) you are not to make any payments from your funds for the purpose of seeking legal aid or advice for any purpose without the consent of the branch but in particular no monies are to be made available either directly or indirectly to the respondents or their solicitors in johns v. allen ((1977) 29 flr 249) or any high court proceeding relative thereto without the consent of the branch.  "(5) you are within seven days of the date of your statement pursuant to (3) above to deliver to the branch or its representatives all books, bank statements, receipts and papers such as will allow a proper audit to be made of the sub-branch's affairs since 1st january, 1970.  "(6) you will terminate the employment of any person taken into employment since the direction imparted by letter dated 9th september, 1976.  "(7) you will co-operate with and provide office facilities for any branch organizers, officials or representatives which visit your office and will instruct your clerical staff accordingly."  the resolution was conveyed to the secretary of the geelong sub-branch the following day.  proceedings under s. 141 concerning the validity of the resolution and under s. 140 concerning the validity of federal rr. 6, 6a, 17 (n) and victorian branch r. 21 were instituted by the secretary of the geelong sub-branch. proceedings were also instituted by the federal secretary under s. 171c and s. 171f concerning the existence of the geelong sub-branch.  held: (1) per evatt and northrop jj., smithers j. dissenting</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp5.36" type=cited from="[1977] FCA 10">the rules requiring, as a condition of eligibility for nomination for election to the offices of federal secretary and assistant federal secretary, a period of five years' continuous membership, while depriving a large number of members of the opportunity for nomination for election to the offices, did not ensure that a person had gained the requisite experience in the conduct of the affairs of the organization. accordingly, when regard was had to the objects of the act and in particular, that of encouraging the participation of members in the affairs of the organization, the rules imposed oppressive and unreasonable conditions on members and were therefore void.  observations on the effect on decisions of the court under s. 140 of the amendment to the act by act no. 138 of 1973 so as to include amongst the statutory objects that of encouraging the democratic control of organizations and the full participation by members in the affairs of the organization.  per smithers j.</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp5.37" type=cited from="[1977] FCA 10">in the context of the composition of the membership of the organization with its high rate of turnover of members, the number of persons excluded from standing for the offices was small. given the important nature of the offices concerned, a five-year continuous membership qualification created a strong probability that the persons elected would possess the necessary qualities for office and accordingly the rules did not offend s. 140 (1) (a) or (c).  observations on the distinction between restrictions on candidature for election to committees with many members and those for important offices.  leveridge v. shop distributive and allied employees' association [1977] fca 9 ; (1977), 31 flr 385 , referred to.  (2) per evatt and northrop jj.</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp5.38" type=cited from="[1977] FCA 10">because of the term of office of the federal secretary and the full-time paid nature of the office compared with the shorter term of office of the other branch committeemen and the honorary nature of some of their offices, the inclusion of the federal secretary as an ex officio member of the branch committee of management imposed on members an oppressive, unreasonable or unjust condition given the influence and persuasion capable of being exerted by the federal secretary on the other members of the branch committee. accordingly, r. 17 (n) was void.  per smithers j.</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp5.39" type=cited from="[1977] FCA 10">the rule offended s. 140 (1) (a) because of its failure to comply with s. 140 (1) (d) in that branch autonomy was invaded if a member of a branch committee was elected by persons not being members of the branch and in that s. 133 (1) (a) required an election of an officer of a branch to be by members of the branch exclusively.  (3) a rule enabling a committee of management to prevent the conduct of a ballot of members was void on the grounds, first, that it did not provide for the control of the committee by the members in accordance with reg. 115 (1) (d) (v); and, secondly, that it imposed oppressive and unreasonable conditions in that rights purportedly given to members might be negatived by the committee of management.  (4) per evatt and northrop jj.</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp5.40" type=cited from="[1977] FCA 10">the presence and participation of the federal secretary in the meeting of a branch committee of management which adopted the resolution directed to the secretary of the sub-branch, when he was not properly a member of that committee, vitiated the resolution.  lynch v. hodges (1963), 4 flr 348 , applied.  stewart v. oliver (no. 2) (1971), 18 flr 83 , and barter v. maher (1972), 21 flr 10 , distinguished.  (5) per evatt and northrop jj.</citphrase>
<citphrase id="cp5.41" type=cited from="[1977] FCA 10">members of a committee of management are under a fiduciary duty to members of the organization and powers conferred on the committee must be exercised bona fide with a view to achieving objects not outside the purpose for which the powers are conferred. accordingly, while the rules provided that the sub-branch should be under the control of and take instructions from the branch, the branch was required to exercise the power bona fide for the purpose of the government of the victorian branch and, in doing so, to act fairly as between different groups of members of the branch.</citphrase>
