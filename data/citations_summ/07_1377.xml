<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCA 417">10 An appeal to this Court does not operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under the judgment appealed: Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth), O 52, r 17. The " general principle " applied in this Court is that an appeal does not operate as a stay: Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1377 at [6] (Appl'd: Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1556 at [8] ). But s 29(1)(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) does confer a discretionary power to make an order suspending the operation of an order previously made. That subsection provides as follows:
 
 Stay of proceedings and suspension of orders 
 (1) Where an appeal to the Court from another court has been instituted: 
 ... 
 (b) the Court or a Judge may, by order, on such conditions (if any) as it or he or she thinks fit, suspend the operation of an injunction or other order to which the appeal, in whole or in part, relates. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2007] FCA 1717">
 
 

10 On 27 August 2007 Goldberg J dismissed the application to stay the orders made by Jessup J on 15 August 2007: Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1377. Justice Goldberg decided that there was no need for a stay of the first three orders made by Jessup J. Orders 1 and 3 would be considered on appeal. Order 2 was in the applicant's favour. He considered the applicant's argument that order 4 be stayed, but rejected a stay because the order simply required the parties to file and serve submissions on costs. His Honour was not prepared to interfere with the trial process. He said that if an adverse costs order was made against the applicant she could appeal and, if it were appropriate, seek an order for a stay. In his reasons, Goldberg J rejected the applicant's very serious complaints about the trial judge and the respondents' legal advisers, which he described as being without basis and unsupported by the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2007] FCA 1555">9 On 27 August 2007, Goldberg J heard and dismissed an application by Ms Bahonko for a stay of the Substantive Orders: see Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1377. 
  18 As Goldberg J identified, O 52 r 17(1) of the Federal Court Rules provides that an appeal " shall not" operate as a stay of execution of the orders appealed from " except so far as ... a Judge... may direct" . Goldberg J was entitled to determine, in light of all the circumstances, whether the matter was an appropriate case for the grant of a stay: Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Co (1996) 67 FCR 65. Clearly, it was not. First, his Honour correctly identified that paras 1, 2 and 3 of the Substantive Orders were not the appropriate subject of a stay: see [2007] FCA 1377 at [7] - [10], [15] and [16]. Neither was it appropriate for Ms Bahonko to seek to suspend the resolution of the substantive applications by seeking a stay of para 4 of the Substantive Orders dealing with submissions on costs. In any event, the Costs Orders were made by Jessup J on 31 August 2007. There is no utility in Ms Bahonko seeking leave to appeal from Goldberg J's refusal to stay para 4 of the Substantive Orders. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FCA 1556">
 
 
 
 
 8 Goldberg J considered the question of a stay of the Substantive Orders in Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1377. His Honour summarised the principles in the following terms at [6]: 
 
 
 
 "The general principle which is applied in the Court is that an appeal does not operate as a stay unless the Court or a Judge otherwise orders. Whether or not such a stay should be granted depends upon whether the Court or a Judge thinks in all the circumstances that the matter is an appropriate case for the grant of a stay: See, for example, Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Co (1996) 137 ALR 498.
