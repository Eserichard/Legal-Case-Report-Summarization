<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FMCA 106">Insofar as the applicant raises procedural fairness issues, any such obligations were met by the Tribunal seeking his views in relation to its jurisdiction. There was no obligation, or indeed power, on the part of the Tribunal in such circumstances to invite the applicant to a hearing pursuant to s.425 of the Act (see SZEYK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1940). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FMCA 313">Rather than press this argument, the applicant appears to be relying on the common law doctrine of procedural fairness which requires that the applicant be given a reasonable opportunity to deal with matters adverse to his interest that the decision maker proposes to take into account in exercising its power; SZEYK v Minister for Immigration [2008] FCA 1940. The applicant submits that the expert's assessment makes it clear that the applicant's failure to seek police intervention until after he was put out of the marital home in February 2007 was a part of the reason for her finding that he did not have a genuine experience of fear arising from the claimed domestic violence and that his failure to report the incidents of domestic violence to the police had not previously been an issue that was raised by either the primary decision-maker, the first expert, the Tribunal or the second expert, so there had been no need to address this issue until the opinion of the second expert was provided to the applicant for comment. In Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory State Revenue v Alphaone [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591-592 the Full Court said: "Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question. " 
This passage was cited with approval in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 at [29] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FMCA 1284">Section 360, relating to a hearing, and for that matter all the other sections set out in Div 5 of Part 5 of the Act, do not apply where the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to conduct the review (see SZEYK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1940). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FMCA 1301">Section 424A, and, for that matter, to the extent that the application complains that he was denied the opportunity to give his evidence, and thus could be said to be some reference to s.425 of the Act, are part of Division 4 of Part 7 of the Act. But, as is very clear, and as submitted by the Minister, this Division does not apply where the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to conduct a review (see SZEYK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1940). </sentence>
