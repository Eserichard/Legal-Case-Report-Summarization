<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1486">I drew attention to my analysis in Zentai v Honourable Brendan O'Connor [2009] FCA 1597 (at [22]-[54]). In that decision, the alternative ground of power was discussed in various decisions there cited. </sentence>

However, the Commonwealth argues that Mr Zentai can remain on bail (see my decision in Zentai v O'Connor [2009] FCA 1597 ; (2009) 263 ALR 511 (at [24]-[27)). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FCA 691">On 16 December 2009 I also made orders in these proceedings staying the s 19 Committal Decision and the s 23 Warrant Decision and admitting Mr Zentai to bail: see Zentai v Honourable Brendan O'Connor [2009] FCA 1597. </sentence>
