<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FMCA 744">It is necessary to identify the employer's reason for termination, see Liquor, Hospitality Miscellaneous Union, Liquor &amp; Hospitality Division, NSW Branch on behalf of its Member, Wayne Roberts v Woonona Bulli RSL Memorial Club Limited [2007] FCA 1460 at [19] where Branson J stated: [19] I do not accept that s 659(2)(g) of the Act calls for the application of a simple 'but for' test of causation. Section 659(2) is concerned to proscribe the termination by an employer of an employee's employment for any one or more of nine separate reasons, or for reasons that include those reasons. Subject to s 664 , the subsection calls for the identification of the employer's reason or reasons for terminating the employee's employment. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 616">Mr Cross referred to Liquor, Hospitality Miscellaneous Union, Liquor &amp; Hospitality Division, NSW Branch on behalf of its member, Wayne Roberts v Woonoona Bulli RSL Memorial Club Ltd [2007] FCA 1460 in which there was an allegation of termination because of a breach of s.659(2) of the Act (the employee refused to sign an Australian Workplace Agreement (AWA)). The response by the RSL Memorial Club was that there was a redundancy question. The case advanced by the Union was that Mr Roberts was dismissed because he did not sign an AWA. The Union put that there was a "but for" test in that but for not signing the AWA, Mr Roberts would not have been terminated. </sentence>
