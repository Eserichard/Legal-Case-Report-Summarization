<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1518">The fact that O 15A incorporates a number of processes and obligations in O 15 is established by the authorities. I refer to Global Intertrade Pty Ltd v Adelaide Festival Centre Trust [1999] FCA 162 (" Global Intertrade "); Tyco Australia Pty Limited v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; Imperial Chemical Industries Plc v Echo Tasmanian Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1731. However, the fact that O 15A incorporates certain parts of O 15 does not mean that it incorporates all parts of the Order. Order 15A does incorporate the provisions of O 15 dealing with inspection (that is, Division 2) but that is done expressly by O 15A r 10. By contrast, O 15 r 8 is a free-standing power available in cases of discovery in existing proceedings. It is not expressly incorporated into O 15A and there is no compelling reason to think that it was intended to be available in a case where an applicant does not have sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in this Court, that is to say, an applicant for preliminary discovery under O 15A r 6. Put another way, while it might be convenient for there to be a power of the type identified in O 15 r 8 in the case of orders for preliminary discovery, it is not so obviously necessary in such cases that it can be implied in the same way as, for example, the provisions dealing with the contents of a List of Documents (O 15 r 6). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] QDC 154">More recently, in Imperial Chemical Industries plc v Echo Tasmania Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1731 , Graham J said at [20], about an application under O 15A r 6: 
 
 
 "It is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility that an applicant may have a claim when that claim is completely dependent on as yet unknown facts. Imperial Chemical Industries plc v Echo Tasmania Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1731 --- cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2009] FCAFC 39">87 In other cases in this Court a variety of forms of orders have been made, in some cases after apparently some argument, and in other cases without any apparent argument. In Conrock Ltd v CSR Ltd [1990] FCA 312 ; (1990) 96 ALR 690 at 695, Pincus J exercised the discretion conferred by O 15A r 11 and indicated that he did not consider that the companies against which preliminary discovery was sought " should perform the work of retrieving the material for nothing ". In London Economics (Aust) Pty Ltd v Frontier Economics Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 932 , Finkelstein J made an order that some of the respondents making discovery be paid their costs. So, too, in Australian Broadcasting Corp v Seven Network Ltd [2005] FCA 1851 , Stone J made an Order that a respondent be paid its reasonable costs of complying with orders for discovery. An Order to the same effect made in Imperial Chemical Industries plc v Echo Tasmania Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1731 was not the subject of appeal: Echo Tasmania Pty Ltd v Imperial Chemical Industries PLC [2008] FCAFC 58.  The sub-paragraph contemplates that the applicant is lacking a piece (or pieces) of information reasonably necessary to decide whether to commence proceedings; (h) it is no answer to an application under the rule to say that the proceeding is in the nature of a 'fishing expedition' ... Indeed Order 15A r 6 'expressly contemplates' what once might have been castigated as 'fishing' ... As Burchett J commented in Paxus Services [Ltd v People Bank Pty Ltd [1990] FCA 500 ; [1990] FCA 500 ; (1990) 99 ALR 728] , the rule is (at 733): 
 
 
 ... designed to enable an applicant, in a situation where his proof can rise no higher than the level the rule describes, to ascertain whether he has a case against the prospective respondent ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 

This summary has since repeatedly been applied (e.g. Village Building Co Ltd v Airservices Australia (No 2) [2008] FCA 1285 at [14] ; Imperial Chemical Industries plc v Echo Tasmania Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1731 at [18] ) and has been endorsed by a Full Court of this Court: Echo Tasmania Pty Ltd v Imperial Chemical Industries PLC [2008] FCAFC 58 at [43] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] WASC 51">4 Further, I should note that I am not involved, in what are interlocutory proceedings, in making 'any findings of fact other than those that are proper in an interlocutory context': Imperial Chemical Industries plc v Echo Tasmania Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1731 [13] (Graham J); see also [8].</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 60">124 Turning to the applicant's Amended Notice of Motion filed 11 April 2007 it seems clear to me that an order for preliminary discovery under Order 15A rule 6 at this stage would be quite inappropriate especially in the absence of a detailed affidavit from the applicant deposing to matters which would satisfy the prerequisites for such an order. Apart from other considerations, it is difficult to see how the applicant could argue that he does not have sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain relief from the respondent in circumstances where he has already commenced such a proceeding (see generally Imperial Chemical Industries plc v Echo Tasmania Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1731 at [14] - [20]).</sentence>
