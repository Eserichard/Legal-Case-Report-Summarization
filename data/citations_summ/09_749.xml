<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] NSWSC 303">In Re Gordon Grant and Grant at [317], McPherson J said that the test in such a case is whether a departure from the proof of debt proceedings is warranted (see also Vagrand Pty Ltd (in liq) v Fielding (1993) 41 FCR 550 [555] and Swaby v Lift Capital Partners Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 749 [24]). The requirement for leave (under whatever may be the applicable statutory provision in the relevant case) ensures that a company in liquidation does not face a multiplicity of legal proceedings that are expensive, time consuming and potentially unnecessary ( Altinova Nominees Pty Ltd v Leveraged Capital Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (in liq) [2009] FCA 42 [17 - 19]). 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] NSWCA 58">As I have noted, most of the reported cases on s 471B do not deal with the question of costs. Those that do tend to protect the liquidator against the costs of the application, such as Re Sydney Formworks Pty Ltd (in liq) [1965] NSWLR 646 at 652 where C McLelland CJ in Eq ordered the liquidator to get his costs out of the assets of the company after a successful application for leave and reserved all other questions of costs. Where the application is lost, the applicant may have to pay the costs; see for instance Swaby v Lift Capital Partners Pty Ltd (in liq) [2009] FCA 749 ; 72 ACSR 627. However there are few reported cases where the application was lost and the judge considered how the costs should be borne. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2010] FMCA 842">Submissions 
 Relevantly, the applicant's submissions in support of the Transfer Application are set out as follows: the originating process in the Companies Action seeks, amongst other things, an order under s.500 (2) of the Corporations Act that the applicant have leave, now for then, to commence and proceed with the Bankruptcy Action against the second, third, fourth &amp; fifth Respondents; the applicant does not concede that leave is required under s.500(2) of the Corporations Act to prosecute the Bankruptcy Action. The applicant accepts that the provision does at least arguably operate as a bar to prosecution of the Bankruptcy Action; courts have developed a number of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion whether or not to grant leave to proceed against a company in liquidation. One such factor is whether the proposed action (in this case the Bankruptcy Action) has arguable merit; [10] if (which is not admitted) the Bankruptcy Action cannot proceed unless and until an order is made in the Companies Action under s.500(2) of the Corporations Act , then the issues the subject of the Bankruptcy Action will be resolved more quickly if the Bankruptcy Action and the Companies Action are both heard in the Federal Court; if (which is not admitted) the Bankruptcy Action cannot proceed unless and until an order is made in the Companies Action under s.500(2) of the Corporations Act , then the issues the subject of the Bankruptcy Action will be resolved in a more cost effective manner if the Bankruptcy Action and the Companies Action are both heard in the Federal Court; if the Bankruptcy Action and the Companies Action are both heard in the Federal Court then it is possible for the Bankruptcy Action and the Companies Action to be heard concurrently or consecutively before the Federal Court. If that were to occur, it gives rise to the following possible savings of judicial time, and cost to the parties: rather than assess the merits of the Bankruptcy Action in a non-binding way for the purposes of the Companies Action, [11] it would be open to the Federal Court to simply determine the Bankruptcy Action and deal with the Companies Action accordingly; and having found in the Companies Action that the Bankruptcy Action has merit, it would be open to the Federal Court to go on to finally determine the Bankruptcy Action. The evidence adduced and the submissions presented in the Bankruptcy Action could then be "piggy backed" onto the evidence adduced and the submissions presented in the Companies Action; if the Federal Court was to find in the Companies Action that the Bankruptcy Action had arguable merit, and that an order should be made under s.500(2) of the Corporations Act , then if the Bankruptcy Action remained in this Court, there would necessarily be some duplication of issues in the Companies Action when the Bankruptcy Action subsequently came to be heard in this Court; this Court and the Federal Court have concurrent jurisdiction in bankruptcy; [12] having regard to the matters set out in the accompanying Statement of Agreed Facts and the submissions made above, the applicant submits that: the Bankruptcy Action is likely to be heard with less cost and more convenience to the parties in the Federal Court than in this Court, hence the factor set out in r.8.02(4)(b) of the FMCA Rules favours the making of the Transfer Order; the Bankruptcy Action is likely to be heard earlier in the Federal Court than in this Court, hence the factor set out in rule 8.02(4)(c) of the FMCA Rules favours the making of the Transfer Order; the parties consent to the transfer, hence the factor set out in r.8.02(4)(e) of the FMC Rules favours the making of the Transfer Order; the Companies Action is a " proceeding in respect of an associated matter " within the meaning of s.39(3)(b) of the FM Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 597">In Swaby v Lift Capital Partners Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 749 at [29] Gilmour J gave an expanded list of factors that may be relevant to the exercise of the court's discretion under s 471B including: 
 
 (a) the amount and seriousness of the claim; 
 (b) the degree and complexity of the legal and factual issues involved; 
 ...
 (f) whether the claim has arguable merit;
 ... 
 (h) whether the proceedings will result in prejudice to the creditors;
 (i) whether the claim is in the nature of a test case for the interest of a large class of potential claimants;
 (j) whether the grant of leave will unleash an 'avalanche of litigation';
 ... 
 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 554">The applicant, Arndell Formwork Pty Limited (in liquidation) submitted that it neither opposes nor consents to Baseline's application for leave. The discretion to grant leave under s 471B is unconfined, however, in considering the issues the Court will be guided by previous decisions as to the relevant factors to be considered and the purpose of the statutory restriction. Those factors were recently summarised by Gilmour J in Swaby v Lift Capital Partners Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 749 at [29] . Among those factors his Honour included "whether a cross-claim arises out of the same factual matrix as the claims made in the primary proceedings". This, in fact, is the nature of Baseline's cross-claim. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] NSWSC 84">16 I turn now to the discretionary factors relevant to the granting of leave under s 471B. They are admirably summarised by Gilmore J in Swaby v Lift Capital Partners Pty Ltd (in liq) [2009] FCA 749 ; (2009) 72 ACSR 627 commencing at [26] and especially at [29], as follows:
 
 "The factors to be taken into account ... have been held to include: 
 

 
 (a) the amount and seriousness of the claim; 
 
 (b) the degree and complexity of the legal and factual issues involved; 
 
 (c) the stage to which the proceedings, if commenced, may have progressed; 
 
 (d) whether a cross-claim arises out of the same factual matrix as the claims made in the primary proceedings; 
 
 (e) the risk that the same issues would be re-litigated if the claims were to be the subject of a proof of debt; 
 
 (f) whether the claim has arguable merit; 
 
 (g) whether proceedings are already in motion at the time of liquidation; 
 
 (h) whether the proceedings will result in prejudice to the creditors; 
 
 (i) whether the claim is in the nature of a test case for the interest of a large class of potential claimants; 
 
 (j) whether the grant of leave will unleash an 'avalanche of litigation'; 
 
 (k) whether the cost of the hearing will be disproportionate to the company's resources; 
 
 (l) delay; and 
 
 (m) whether pretrial procedures, such as discovery and interrogatories, are likely to be required or beneficial. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2009] FCA 1298">Section 471B of the Corporations Act does not prescribe criteria which condition the exercise of the Court's power to grant leave to a person to begin or proceed with a proceeding against a company in liquidation. Although there is extensive case law on applications made under s 471B and its predecessors, no attempt has been made to identify exhaustively the circumstances in which it might be appropriate for leave to be granted: see Re Gordon Grant and Grant Pty. Ltd. [1983] 2 Qd R 314 at 317. The case law has recently and helpfully been summarised by Gilmour J in Swaby v Lift Capital Partners Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 749 at [22] - [32]. </sentence>
