The issue before Tracey J was whether a grievance procedure in the agreement was mandatory and that is quite different from the issue before me. Nevertheless, Tracey J said and I agree that the principles relevant to the construction of commercial contracts may also be relevant and of assistance in the construction of industrial agreements (at [37]). </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FMCA 965">So long as obligations continue to arise, and work is performed and entitlements continue to accrue, as occurred here with King and Kruger continuing to work, the arrangements founding those obligations, in this case the Pre-Reform AWAs, are current. They are also continuing: the two words --- "currency" and "continue" --- are not in this context mutually exclusive --- far from it --- because the continuing obligations arise out of the current arrangement, in this case the Pre-Reform AWAs. In that sense it does not matter that different words --- "continues" and "currency" - are used in clauses 3 and 27 of King's Pre-Reform AWA. In any event, the suggested distinction involves a very fine distinction between two words, which to the ordinary person, might convey the same or a similar meaning. AWAs, like industrial awards, ought not to be interpreted with a fine-tooth comb. [18] The correctness of that approach is reinforced by the errors, both textual and grammatical in clause 27.3 of Mr King's and Mr Kruger's Pre-Reform AWAs which demonstrate that the Pre-Reform AWAs have not been drafted with precision, or particular attention to detail. </sentence>

Their Honours set out the decisions in which Australian Courts have suggested that such a term exists [174] and those which have not. [175] Their Honours also indicated that the High Court appears to have endorsed the concept on a few occasions. Specifically, the Full Court reproduced a quote from Koehler v Cerebros (Australia) Limited , [176] where the majority (McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ) said, in the context of a suit in negligence, that: [177] 
 
 it is only when the contractual position between the parties (including the implied duty of trust and confidence between them) 'is explored fully along with the relevant statutory framework' that it would be possible to give appropriate content to the duty of reasonable care upon which an employee claiming damages for negligent infliction of psychiatric injury at work would seek to rely.

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FCAFC 92">71 As the primary Judge had already found that ESA discriminated against Ms Poniatowska on the ground of her sex and had contravened s 14(2)(c) of the SD Act, his Honour did not decide whether a term of mutual trust and confidence ought be implied into Ms Poniatowska's employment contract. His Honour considered that such a finding would not have added to the range of remedies or the extent of the compensation awarded. His Honour simply noted the observations of Tracey J in Van Efferen v CMA Corporations Limited (2009) 183 IR 319 ; [2009] FCA 597 , which highlighted that the implication of such terms in contracts of employment remained one of controversy on which the High Court has yet to make a definitive pronouncement.

<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] VSC 196">215 The question as to whether, in a contract of employment, there is to be implied an obligation of good faith, and, if so, the impact of that obligation on the parties' rights to terminate such a contract, has been the subject of much discussion in the cases. There is authority for the proposition that such an obligation may be implicit in a contract of employment. [57] I note however that there are some cases, in which the view had been expressed, albeit obiter dictum, that no such obligation may be implied in a contract of employment. [58] Further, it has been held that any such obligation would not be implied, so as to affect a right of termination of a contract expressly provided by the contract itself or under statute. [59] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] WADC 13">30 A similar issue arose in the decision in Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Limited [2009] FCA 597. In that case, Mr Van Efferen was employed pursuant to a combination of an Australian Workplace Agreement ("AWA") and a common law contract of employment. He was employed in a supervisory capacity to do work as part of a contract between the defendant, CMA Corporation Ltd ("CMA"), and John Holland to demolish a wharf in Port Hedland. As a result of certain differences of opinion, the plaintiff, in early to mid October 2006, was removed from the Port Hedland site and relocated to a site in Geelong. At the end of October 2006 the plaintiff's employment was terminated ostensibly because of a "lack of available work [in his] specialised field of work" [16]. The termination appears to have been pursuant to a clause similar to cl 14.2 in the present case (see [29]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2009] NSWDC 396">42. I am not persuaded the authorities concerning obligations of good faith assist in the resolution of this dispute. In single judgments of the Federal Court of Australia it has been doubted that a term requiring mutual trust and confidence could be implied in employment contracts: McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1903 ; (2007) 168 I.R. 375 at (398-400), per Buchanan J; Walker v Citigroup Global Markets Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1678 ; (2005) 226 ALR 114 at 156-157 (Kenny J) (the appeal, at [2006] FCAFC 101 ; (2006) 233 ALR 687 at [86] did not consider the point); and Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Ltd [2009] FCA 597 at [85] (Tracey J). On the other hand, as I have noted, the Court of Appeal, (by way of obiter), put forward the contrary position in C.G.U. Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd . Here I see resolution of the case arising from construing the written contract: no implied terms of trust and confidence are necessary in its construction. Nor were any pleaded.

<sentence id="cs12" from="[2009] FCA 970">Ventana concerned a section of a statute, not a consensual industrial instrument. Nevertheless, the interpretative technique to the be applied is similar. As Tracey J remarked in Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Limited [2009] FCA 597 , at [40]; 
 The terms in which industrial instruments are drafted often require a distinction to be drawn between aspirational and promissory statements. In accordance with the objective theory of contract expounded in Toll [(FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 ] a provision in a document proffered by an employer, will be treated as promissory in nature if the hypothetical, reasonable, potential employee to whom the document is presented would have concluded that [the employer] intended to be contractually bound to follow the procedures, outlined in it... 

 
The same is true of provisions which are merely "facultative". This point has been made, in the context of a rostering system operating in "a practical industrial relations context", by Marshall J in Bell v Minister for Health [2006] FCA 134 ; see esp.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs13" from="[2009] FCA 894">The Union also stressed the observations of the High Court in Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd (2004) 219 CLR 165 ; [2004] HCA 52 at [40] as follows: 
 This Court, in Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [(2004) [2004] HCA 35 ; [2004] HCA 35 ; 218 CLR 451] , has recently reaffirmed the principle of objectivity by which the rights and liabilities of the parties to a contract are determined. It is not the subjective beliefs or understandings of the parties about their rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations. What matters is what each party by words and conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe. References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreement. The meaning of the terms of a contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean. That, normally, requires consideration not only of the text, but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, and the purpose and object of the transaction. 

 
These principles were applied to a workplace agreement in Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Ltd [2009] FCA 597 at [38] .  

 
 (f) The agreement must be construed in relation to the matrix of facts that existed at the time the agreement was made: Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [(2001) 106 IR 172] [2001] FCA 335.

 Introduction 
 This is an appeal against an award of damages to a former teacher for breach of his employment contract.  Apart from Downe , [69] none of the Australian authorities has addressed the implication of the term of mutual trust and good faith in circumstances like the present in which a statute provides many of the significant terms and conditions of the employment relationship. (In Downe Rothman J regarded himself as bound to find that the term was implied into Dr Downe's contract of employment [70] ). Further, none has addressed the operation of the implied term in circumstances, like the present, in which statute, regulation or industrial award provides a variety of means by which employees may be protected from abuses of power by the employer, and provides means of redress to employees who are aggrieved by some conduct of the employer. [71] </sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] FCA 680">In a recent decision of Tracey J, Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Limited [2009] FCA 597 , his Honour noted at [80] that the question of whether such terms may be implied in contracts of employment is one of controversy on which the High Court has yet to make a definitive pronouncement. His Honour reviewed the authorities and made the following observations at [83]-[85]: 
 In this Court single judges have adopted a more guarded approach. In McDonald (at 398-400) Buchanan J reviewed the authorities relating to the mutual trust and confidence term. As I have found that ESA discriminated against Ms Poniatowska on the ground of her sex, and contravened s 14(2)(c) of the SD Act by so discriminating against her by dismissing her, I do not need to decide whether, in the circumstances, a term of mutual trust and confidence ought be implied into Ms Poniatowska's employment contract. Such a finding would not add to the range of remedies or the extent of the compensation awarded. In those circumstances, it is appropriate simply to note the observations of Tracey J in Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Limited [2009] FCA 597. </sentence>
