<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FMCA 220">First, as the Minister correctly submits, given its findings that the notification had been properly sent, had complied with all relevant legislative and regulatory requirements, and given that the application for review to it was received after the expiry of the prescribed period for the making of such applications, the Tribunal had no power to extend the relevant time. I note relevant authorities in support of that proposition. ( Lee v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 305 , Xie v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 172 - " Xie ", Murphy v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 657 ; (2004) 135 FCR 550 - " Murphy ", SZIUK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 226). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 962">It was clearly out of time. The time limit under s.412 is mandatory. The Tribunal has now power to extend it, nor does the Court. There are a number of decisions which make it quite clear that there is a mandatory time limit provided by s.412 , including SZIUK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2] , and also SZKOY v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [3] . </sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 155">11 The 28-day time limit imposed by s 412(1)(b) and reg 4.31(2)(b) is mandatory. That is the basis on which the Tribunal found it had no jurisdiction to review the delegate's decision. The Federal Magistrate in my view correctly held that the Tribunal had no option but to make the finding that it did. It is irrelevant whether it was the applicant's friend's father or his migration agent who assisted him in his application. That the time limit is mandatory and that the Tribunal has no power to extend the time is now well-established by decisions of this Court; see, for example, Fernando v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 324 ; (2000) 97 FCR 407 , and, more recently, SZIUK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 226 , in which his Honour found:
 
 "Although the appellant claims that his late application occurred because of the negligent conduct of his Migration Agent it is notable that he did not notify the Department that he had an agent acting for him. In any event, as the Tribunal and the learned Magistrate have held, the application was lodged a week late. The Tribunal did not have power to enlarge time or jurisdiction to entertain the application. " </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2007] FMCA 1488">Every step of the preparation was made by the migration agent. I note that the migration agent's name and address did not appear on the application to the Tribunal. I have had referred to me, the decision of Tracey J in SZIUK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2] . In that decision, which was a decision on an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court, his Honour said: 
 
 
 Although the appellant claims that his late application occurred because of the negligent conduct of his migration agent, it is notable that he did not notify the Department that he had an agent acting for him. In any event, as the Tribunal and the learned magistrate have held, the application was lodged a week late. The Tribunal did not have power to enlarge time or jurisdiction to entertain the application. (See s.412(1)(b) of the Act and reg.4.312 of the Migration Regulations (1994) Commonwealth).
