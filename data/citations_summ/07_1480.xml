<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] FCAFC 3">2 The background to this matter can be briefly stated. Andros proposes to perform the Anvil Hill project in the Hunter Valley district of New South Wales. On 11 January 2007, Andros referred the Anvil Hill project to the Minister to decide whether it was a controlled action. On 19 January 2007, a delegate of the first respondent decided that the Anvil Hill project was not a controlled action, with the consequence that it could proceed without further approval being required under the Act. On 17 May 2007, the appellant filed an application under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) for review of the delegate's decision. Her Honour the primary judge dismissed the application: see Anvil Hill Project Watch Association Inc v Minister for the Environment and Water Resources [2007] FCA 1480 ; (2007) 97 ALD 398. 
 </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 8">22 The function of the referral step is not to fix in stone all the details of a proposed "action" for the subsequent approval process. Rather, this mechanism results in the proposal either being brought within the Environment Act assessment and approval regime, or being exempted from the requirements of assessment and approval under the Act. In Anvil Hill Project Watch Association Inc v Minister for the Environment and Water Resources [2007] FCA 1480 ; (2007) 97 ALD 398 at [70] , Stone J described the scheme of the Act as providing 
 
 an initial clearing house so that actions that are likely to have a significant impact on the environment are properly assessed and those that do not fall into that category may be identified in a timely way and not impeded. 

The referral mechanism operates as a kind of triage system. It is not the function of the triage nurse to make a detailed diagnosis, let alone prescribe treatment.</sentence>
