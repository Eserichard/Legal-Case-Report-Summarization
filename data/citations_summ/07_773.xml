<sentence id="cs0" from="[2008] QCA 327">[10] 
[32] Division 3 of Part 11B of TAA sets out how the Commissioner must treat various kinds of amounts, including a payment the Commissioner receives in respect of a tax debt of an entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FMCA 858">The case of Strictly Stainless does not provide the applicant with any support for his application for a stay. As in Strictly Stainless , the "decision" that the applicant here might seek judicial review of is the respondent's decision to proceed with insolvency proceedings rather than enter into negotiations to either give the applicant time to pay or to compromise the debt. I am not satisfied that these are decisions that would be capable of review under the AD(JR) Act. Nor on the authorities am I satisfied that a decision by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation taken pursuant to the ATO Receivables Policy is a decision that is capable of review under the AD(JR) Act (see Bilborough v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 773 ; (2007) 95 ALD 371 at paras.24 to 27). </sentence>
