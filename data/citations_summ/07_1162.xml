<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCAFC 55">76 I think it is appropriate to make the point that the question of whether an exercise of power under cl 070.511(c)(i) is a decision within s 474(3) of the Act or s 3(2) of the ADJR Act is by no means a straightforward one. This is so at least partly because of the wording of cl 070.511(c)(i). Paragraph (i) refers to a notice in writing stating a certain matter. The giving of the notice has the effect of bringing the visa to an end. There are difficulties in the way of characterising the notice as a certificate within s 474(3)(b) , particularly as privative clauses are to be construed strictly: Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 505 [72] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. Furthermore, there are difficulties in treating a notice as a decision: Chung v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 442 at [18] - [19] per Conti J; MZXMI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1162 at [12] per Gordon J. In addition to these matters, it seems to me to be somewhat artificial to say that the Minister's act of being satisfied that the holder's removal from Australia is reasonably practicable is conduct preparatory to a decision within s 474(3)(h). </sentence>
