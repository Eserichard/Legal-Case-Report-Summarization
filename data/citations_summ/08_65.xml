<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 391">On the first question, in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v E-Direct Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 65 (" E-Direct ") (at [21]---[24]), I set out what I considered to be the principles applicable to an application which is consented to by both parties that the Court make certain declarations; that is, what are sometimes referred to as consent declarations. While that decision dealt with proceedings under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), as it then was, I consider the principles I outlined are apt for the present proceedings. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1987">24 In regulatory contexts comparable to the present, this Court has informed itself as to those facts necessary for the granting of declaratory relief by reference to agreed facts and indeed the consent of the parties: Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV 'Mawashi Al Gasseem' (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 at [10] ---[16] [2007] FCA 815 ; , 240 ALR 120 at 122---4; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1534 at [10] per Nicholson J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v EDirect Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 65 at [20] ---[30], ATPR 42---216; Secretary, Department of Health &amp; Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [74] ---[79]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30], [34], ATPR 41---801.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs2" from="[2008] FCA 1545">77 Declarations have thus been made by consent by this Court in the context of a party admitting a contravention of the Trade Practices Act : eg, Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1534 at [10] per Nicholson J. The authorities and the approach of this Court to the making of declarations by consent have also recently been usefully summarised by Reeves J in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v EDirect Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 65 at [20] ---[30], ATPR 42-216.
