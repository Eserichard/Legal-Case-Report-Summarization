<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] FCA 687">The third ground involves s 252D of the Act which provides that proxy documents must be received by the responsible entity at least 48 hours before the meeting. It is said that this means that the proxies must be sent only to the responsible entity, and not to any other intervening party. It is further submitted that any failure to comply with this requirement will result in the proxies being invalid or the meeting being invalid, or both. Authority for this proposition is said to be found in the decision of Dodds-Streeton J in Bisan Ltd v Cellante [2002] VSC 430 ; (2002) 173 FLR 310 and Re Golden West Resources Ltd [2008] FCA 1362 ; (2008) 170 FCR 409 , a decision of McKerracher J. A different approach was taken by the Takeovers Panel in Re Lion Selection Ltd (No 2) (2008) 66 ACSR 656. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] NSWSC 254">11 At some time shortly before 18 March 2008, Mr Osburg was alerted by Computershare Investor Services Pty Ltd, a company retained by the defendant to provide certain co-ordination services in connection with the meeting of members, to "a recent court decision to the effect that unless a signed proxy form is sent directly to the company holding the election it may be inadmissible" (these words appear in a letter of 18 March 2008 from Mr Osburg to "Fellow AJC Members").
