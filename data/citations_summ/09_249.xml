<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 715">In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Weerappah (No 2) [2009] FCA 249 at [7] - [9], Goldberg J summarised the principles relevant to the appointment of a provisional liquidator as follows: 
 
 
 "[T]he Court has a wide and unfettered discretion whether to appoint a provisional liquidator, the only jurisdictional precondition being that a winding-up application in relation to the company has been filed. [8] The principles which apply where a court is considering whether to appoint a provisional liquidator are well established and the following propositions can be extracted from the authorities:
 (a) the applicant for the appointment must satisfy the Court that there is a reasonable prospect that a winding-up order will be made at the final hearing: Australian Securities Commission v Solomon (1996) 19 ACSR 73 at 80; 
 (b) an applicant must establish that there is good reason for the Court intervening prior to the final hearing of the winding-up application on the basis that the appointment of a provisional liquidator is required in the public interest or to preserve the status quo or to protect the company's assets from dissipation: Allstate Explorations NL v Batepro Australia Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 261 at [30] ; 
 (c) the appointment of a provisional liquidator pending the determination of a winding-up application is a drastic intrusion into the affairs of a company and should not be made if other measures are adequate to preserve the status quo: Zempilas v JN Taylor Holdings Ltd (No 2) (1990) 55 SASR 103 at 107; Lubavitch Mazal Pty Ltd v Yeshiva Properties No1 Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 535 ; (2003) 47 ACSR 197 at [217] .
