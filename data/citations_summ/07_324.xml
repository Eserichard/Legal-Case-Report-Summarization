<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1106">Even if that inherent conflict of obligations can be resolved, there remains a risk that Schutz's commercially sensitive and confidential information may be quite inadvertently misused by VIP. Once the information is learned by Mr Perkins it cannot necessarily be forgotten. In Conor Medsystems Inc v University of British Columbia (No 4) [2007] FCA 324 Finkelstein J said (at [7]-[8]): When deciding whether or not to make a protective order to protect trade secrets United States courts strike a balance between, on the one hand, the need for full and open discovery and, on the other, the need to protect parties from a misuse of trade secrets by competitors. Striking the right balance will present difficulties in the case of in-house counsel. In-house counsel are not automatically denied access to an opponent's confidential information: R R Donnelley &amp; Sons Co v Quark Inc 2007 US Dist Lexis 424.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1422">16 In Conor Medsystems, Inc v The University of British Columbia (No 4) [2007] FCA 324 Finkelstein J included in a group to whom the University's confidential documents could be disclosed its "associate general counsel for litigation" who practised in the United States as a lawyer and a patent attorney. Her role was co-ordinating patent litigation involving the applicant in five countries --- Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Netherlands. Counsel's role in the Australian litigation was to instruct the applicant's external legal advisers in the United States who in turn instructed the applicant's Australian lawyers. Her evidence was that it was important to the conduct of the Australian proceedings that she have access to all confidential documents so that she was properly involved in determining strategy and making decisions on behalf of the applicant. She did not participate in competitive decision-making, that is to say she was not involved in making company decisions that affect contracts, marketing, employment, pricing, product design, or "any or all of the client's decisions ... made in light of similar or corresponding information about a competitor".</sentence>
