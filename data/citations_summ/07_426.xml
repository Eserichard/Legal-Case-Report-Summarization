<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 1140">24 In this case there appeared to be limited material before the Minister as to the best interests of each of the applicant's children under the age of 18. Ms Wheatley for the Minister submitted that there was no obligation on the Minister to initiate further inquiries as to information concerning the children, and indeed this point was not in contention: cf Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292 at 314, Taylor [2005] FCAFC 208 at [19] , Yalniz v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 426 at [24] . Relevant material before the Minister in relation to the applicant's case, which is also before me, included:
 
 
 &#8226; from the Issues Paper, information including:
 o the applicant has four children under the age of 18
 o one child, Darryl Holani is autistic 
 
 
 
 
 o the applicant has an order of the court dated 15 October 2003, allowing him regular contact with his children Darryl and Nikita, "at all reasonable times as may be agreed between the parties" but on no less than four days per fortnight 
 
 
 
 
 o according to Ms Susan Amery, the mother of Joshua: 
 
 
 
 
 "Clyde is a wonderful &amp; loving father. Our son and he are very close.</sentence>
