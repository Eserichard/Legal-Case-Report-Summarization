<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 1080">GSMA, on the other hand, contends that PSL misstates the effect of s 601FS(1) of the Act. In Australian Olive Holdings Pty Ltd v Huntley Management Ltd [2009] FCA 1479 ; (2009) 76 ACSR 256 , Lindgren J said at 268 that the rights and obligations and liabilities of the former RE to which s 601FS(1) refers are impliedly limited to those that are capable of having ongoing operation after the change in RE. In Huntley Management Ltd v Timbercorp Securities Ltd (above), Rares J also (at [44]) observed that s 601FS(2) and s 601FT(2) recognise that the former RE retains rights and obligations and liabilities that they had accrued or applied to it prior to the change. The change in RE becomes effective when ASIC records names the new RE in place of the former under s 601FJ.  The expression "in relation to" is of wide and general import and should not be read down in the absence of some compelling reason to do so: Fountain v Alexander [1982] HCA 16 ; (1982) 150 CLR 615 at 629 per Mason J. In Syncap Management (Rural) Australia Ltd v Lyford [2004] FCA 1352 ; (2004) 51 ACSR 223 at 232 [46] RD Nicholson J held that "in relation to" as used in s 610FS(1) [sic-601FS(1)] was an expression of wide import and signified no more than some relationship or connection. As Lindgren J noted, however, the rights, obligations and liabilities of the former responsible entity to which each of ss 601FS(1) and 601FT(1) apply, are impliedly limited to those capable of having an ongoing operation after the change in responsible entity: Re Huntley Management Ltd; Australian Olive Holdings Pty Ltd v Huntley Management Ltd [2009] FCA 1479 ; (2009) 76 ACSR 256 at 268 [85] . 
 

 
 
 48 Ordinarily, the scheme would give the responsible entity a legal, and possibly a larger, right to hold scheme property, such as land, in its name. But, by force of ss 601FJ, 601FS(1) and 601FT(1) that right necessarily passes to the new responsible entity on a change becoming effective.</sentence>

In Syncap Management (Rural) Australia Ltd v Lyford [2004] FCA 1352 ; (2004) 51 ACSR 223 at 232 [46] RD Nicholson J held that "in relation to" as used in s 610FS(1) was an expression of wide import and signified no more than some relationship or connection.
