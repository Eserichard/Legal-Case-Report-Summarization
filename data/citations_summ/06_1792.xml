11 Mr Free had already signed the necessary memoranda of resignation when the matter came before the court. Each was dated 14 September 2010. On the basis of Mr Free's statement of his own position in his affidavit (that is, that he intended to complete his separation) and having regard to the approach taken to s 473(7) in decided cases (see, in particular, Re Wily [2003] NSWSC 1260 ; (2003) 49 ACSR 94 ; Re Vouris [2004] NSWSC 384 ; (2004) 49 ACSR 543 ; Re McGrath [2005] NSWSC 506 ; (2005) 54 ACSR 55 ; Dean-Willcocks; re Militto's Transport Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1792 ; (2006) 61 ACSR 356 ; Emerton v Referral Marketing Services Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 738) , it was seen as appropriate to make an order having immediate effect but expressed to fill the vacancy to arise upon completion of the rule 7.1 steps.
