<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] FCA 1067">The appellant submits that the Tribunal failed to fulfil its obligation in s 425(1) of the Act in that it did not advise the appellant that the claimed connection between the police and the CPI(M) was an issue arising in relation to the decision under review. Again, he refers to SZBEL . This submission must be rejected. Nothing occurred before the Tribunal hearing which could have led the appellant to assume that the claimed connection between the police and the CPI(M) was not an issue before the Tribunal. I say that because the appellant did not raise the claimed connection before the hearing ( SZJUB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1486 at [21] per Bennett J; SZDTM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1258 at [72] per Dowsett J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2008] FCA 1613">22 Counsel for the appellants referred to the line of authority of which Farajvand v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 795 and Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 (2003) 216 CLR 473 are part. In effect, counsel for the appellants argued that the need, or perceived need, to be seen to restrict activities can itself amount to serious harm. That is not the basis on which those authorities turn. It is abundantly clear, particularly from the passages in [29] and [33] of Allsop J's reasons for judgment in Farajvand , as well as from the judgments in S395 itself, that a person will only be seen to have a well-founded fear of persecution if there is a need, or a perceived need, to curtail activities in order to avoid persecution. Given that s 91R of the Migration Act equates serious harm with persecution for this purpose, it will be necessary to show that a person must adopt, or perceives the need to adopt, restrictions on that person's activities in order to avoid serious harm. The imposition of restrictions on activities simply to avoid threats, or simply to avoid harm that does not amount to serious harm, will not itself become a form of serious harm. This position is confirmed by the very recent judgment of Dowsett J in SZDTM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1258 , especially at 74.</sentence>
