<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] FCA 901">The respondent in the proceeding, Apotex, submits that it is entitled to its costs of the amendment application and that an order should be made against Otsuka accordingly. It submits that the amendments have been sought in the context of infringement proceedings to which it is a party respondent and in which an interlocutory injunction has been granted against it (albeit by consent). Apotex submits that it is not to the point that, ultimately, it did not oppose the amendments: it was necessary for it to consider the amendments and come to a view about whether those amendments were allowable and whether there was a basis for opposition (whether on legal grounds or on discretionary grounds) and whether, in the circumstances in which it found itself, it should oppose the amendments. Apotex also points to a line of authority which supports the proposition that, where a patentee seeks to amend its patent in the context of existing legal proceedings, it is frequently the case that the patentee pays a defendant's or an opponent's costs: see Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoires Servier (No 3) [2009] FCA 1069 at [5] ; see also the statement of the practice in Young D, Watson A, Thorley S and Miller R, Terrell on the Law of Patents (14th ed, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1994) at [7.52]. </sentence>
