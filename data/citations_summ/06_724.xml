<sentence id="cs0" from="[2011] FCA 237">And, as he later explained in his classic judgment in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41, in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it is generally for the decision-maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power. Mason J said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance, but the preferred ground on which that power was to be exercised was that the decision was "manifestly unreasonable". A person entrusted with a discretion must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider: Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 39 per Mason J applying Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223 at 228 per Lord Greene MR. 
 

 
 
 [106] A decision-maker must give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the merits of the case: Khan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1987] FCA 457 ; (1987) 14 ALD 291 at 292 per Gummow J; Zhang v Canterbury City Council [2001] NSWCA 167 ; (2001) 51 NSWLR 589 at 601 [62] where Spigelman CJ collected the authorities; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 367 [138] per Kirby J; NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at 92-93 [212] per Madgwick J, 96 [229] per Conti J; SZEJF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 724 at [39] , [60] where I applied this principle. In Tickner v Chapman (1995) 57 FCR 451 at 462C-D, Black CJ said that where a decision-maker was required to consider material, the process of consideration "... involves an active intellectual process" directed at the nominated subject-matter: see too per Burchett J at 476F-477E, per Kiefel J at 495F-G and Tobacco Institute of Australia v National Health &amp; Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265 at 277G per Finn J; Australian Retailers Association 148 FCR at 577 [526] per Weinberg J. 
 

 
 
 [107] Where a decision-maker must consider matters prescribed by law, generally, he or she cannot jettison or ignore some of those factors or give them cursory consideration only in order to put them to one side: East Australian Pipeline Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] HCA 44 ; (2007) 233 CLR 229 at 244 [52] per Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2011] FMCA 89">The applicant's position is that the Tribunal's statutory duty is to review the delegate's decision (s.414 of the Act and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI [2009] HCA 39 ; (2009) 83 ALJR 1123 ; (2009) 259 ALR 429 ; (2009) 111 ALD 15) , and that this requires consideration of the claims and evidence. The relevant evidence (the UNESCO letters) was critical to the applicant's claim and the failure to consider the evidence, that is to give it proper, genuine and realistic consideration, amounts to a failure to review and therefore jurisdictional error.

In relation to ground 3, the applicant contends that: In forming the view that there is not a real chance that the applicant will be seriously harmed by reason of his profile as a student politician, the RRT did not consider the cumulative impact of the applicant's claims and failed to direct its mind to the appropriate tests provided in Chan v MIEA (1989) 169 CLR 379 where the High Court established that a fear of persecution will be well-founded if there is a real chance that it will occur. This test was expressed by the High Court as follows: (per Toohey J at 407) (A real chance) discounts what is remote or insubstantial; (per Dawson J at 398) A real chance is one that is not remote, regardless of whether it is less or more than 50 per cent; (per McHugh J at 429) An applicant for refugee status may have a well-founded fear of persecution even though there is only a 10 per cent chance that he will be ... persecuted... A far-fetched possibility of persecution must be excluded. The RRT made findings that the applicant is a member of particular social political groups in Nepal that according to the country information are subject persecution by the Maoists and the affiliated Youth Communist League. The RRT noted the volatile circumstances currently experienced in Nepal including the lack of capacity of the various enforcement agencies to ensure security and notwithstanding stated: "while the political circumstances in Nepal remain volatile, the Nepali Congress Party is the main party in the ruling coalition, and the government continues to function despite attacks on people by groups such as the YCL. The Tribunal is not satisfied that there is a real chance that the applicant will be seriously harmed because he is a long-term supporter of the ruling congress Party, or because of his activities in the Congress Party student union, even though he, along with the rest of the population in Nepal, may be adversely affected by the prevailing political uncertainty. " [76] It is respectfully submitted that such conclusion is irrational in the face of the RRT's finding in relation to the applicant's membership to particular social political groups, his political belief and opinions, and the objective events of persecution in Nepal such that the decision which in effect is that the risk of the applicant being persecuted is far-fetched or remote is manifestly unreasonable and the constituted jurisdictional error. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2011] FCA 53">In SZJSS Rares J held (at 280 [43]) that the Tribunal's statement that it gave "no weight" to letters corroborating the appellants' claims in the circumstances of that case was inconsistent with "any rational, reasonable approach to the evaluation of that evidence"; and, because of this, his Honour concluded that the Tribunal "was not genuinely considering the appellants' claims as corroborated by the letters on the material before it". His Honour explained (at 280-1 [43]) that: 
 
 [The Tribunal] used the formula of giving material "no weight" as a basis on which it might ignore probative, relevant and highly supportive material corroborating the factual basis of the fears which the husband claimed. It did this simply as a basis for putting the evidence to one side, having said that it had looked at it. In Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1758 ; (2008) 176 FCR 153 at 1818-182 [106] - [107] (approved in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal [2009] FCAFC 23 ; (2009) 175 FCR 201 at 24 [242 [267] per Jacobson, Lander and Foster JJ and Lafu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 140 at [47] per Lingren, Foster JJ and myself) I said:

In Tickner v Chapman (1995) 57 FCR 451 at 462C-D, Black CJ said that where a decision-maker was required to consider material, the process of consideration "... involves an active intellectual process" directed at the nominated subject-matter: see too per Burchett J at 476F-477E, per Kiefel J at 495F-G and Tobacco Institute of Australia v National Health &amp; Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265 at 277G per Finn J; Australian Retailers Association 148 FCR at 577 [526] per Weinberg J. 
 
 

 
 
 
 Where a decision-maker must consider matters prescribed by law, generally, he or she cannot jettison or ignore some of those factors or give them cursory consideration only in order to put them to one side: East Australian Pipeline Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2007) 233 CLR 229 at 244 [52] per Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ. As Gummow and Hayne JJ, in concurring observed ( East Australian Pipeline 233 CLR at 256 [102]): 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 It was not enough for the ACCC to say in its final determination that it had considered those matters in the sense of having looked at but discarded them.

The respondent does not accept that this formulation is a matter which discloses jurisdictional error. The applicant relies on what fell from Gleeson CJ in NAIS v Minister for Immigration [2005] HCA 77 and the views expressed by Rares J in SZEJF v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 724 and his Honour's iteration of those views in SZGUR v Minister for Immigration [2010] FCA 171 at [36] . But that case is on appeal to the High Court of Australia.

" The failure to do so led the Tribunal into error and that error had an adverse affect on the Tribunal's assessment of the first appellant's credibility. The Tribunal failed to have regard to material evidence and as the Tribunal's own comments show that initial error was not corrected..." The applicant also placed reliance on the views expressed by Rares J in SZEJF v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 724 which was a case involving the Tribunal's finding of implausibility in relation to certain newspaper articles. At [59] his Honour said: "I am of opinion that by the way in which it dismissed the objective evidence provided in the two newspaper articles, the tribunal ignored relevant material (the newspaper articles) and relied on irrelevant material (namely its bare, unsupported assertions that the objective facts demonstrated in the newspaper articles were 'somewhat implausible' and gave 'no evidence' of the Jirga's activities). That was a jurisdictional error: see Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179; Secretary of State for Education and Science v Thameside Metropolitan Borough Council [1976] UKHL 6 ; [1977] AC 1014 at 1047D-E; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222 at 233 [27] , 241 [58], 250 [97] and SZGDB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 431 at [33] - [38] .</sentence>

<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 1067">The appellant submits that the Tribunal did not give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the claimed link between the police and CPI(M). The Tribunal addressed the issue and stated its reasons for rejecting the appellant's allegation of a link. I do not think there is any substance in this submission, and therefore I do not need to address the question of the proper description of the Tribunal's obligation under s 414 of the Act to review the decision (see NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at 16 [50] - [51]; SZEJF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 724 at [39] per Rares J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2009] FCA 966">Generally, the fact that the Tribunal has addressed an issue may be inferred from its reasons, however in this case I am not satisfied that the Tribunal has addressed the visa applicant's claimed reason for visiting Australia based on the statements to which my attention has been directed by Counsel. Procedural fairness requires the tribunal to give real consideration to the claim of the visa applicant and the merits of his case, including his claimed reason for visiting Australia. That failure to do so constitutes a denial of natural justice --- and a jurisdictional defect infecting the decision of the Tribunal --- is clear from such cases as Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2003) 197 ALR 389 at 394, 406-407, 408 , Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 367 per Kirby J, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Maltsin [2005] FCAFC 118 at [38] , SZEJF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) FCA 724 at [38] - [39]. That the Tribunal did not consider the claimed reason of the visa applicant for visiting Australia, but considered the application before it exclusively in light of the circumstances of the group into which the Tribunal categorised the visa applicant --- namely Ahmadi Muslims from Pakistan --- is evident from the conduct of the hearing and the Tribunal's findings. In particular I note the following: the consideration by the Tribunal of the fact that the appellant had claimed to be at risk of persecution because she was an Ahmadi Muslim (at [23]) and that the visa applicant was also an Ahmadi Muslim (at [22]); the fact that, during the proceedings before the Tribunal, the Tribunal asked the appellant "why her son, as an Ahmadi, would not seek asylum should he come to Australia" (at [32]); the fact that, during questioning of the visa applicant by telephone, it appears that the Tribunal focussed almost exclusively on the fact that the visa applicant was an Ahmadi Muslim, which suggested that the visa applicant faced persecution in Pakistan.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2009] FMCA 583">Third, in my view, having regard to the Tribunal's reasons for decision, and on a plain reading of its decision record, there is no suggestion that the Tribunal failed to undertake a "proper, genuine and realistic consideration [of] the merits of the case" ( SZEJF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 724 at [39] , per Rares J). </sentence>

Second, the Tribunal is not required to make findings on each piece of evidence before it, nor to refer to each individual piece of evidence to demonstrate that it has taken into account the fact or facts to which the evidence refers: Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf (2001) 206 CLR 323 ; [2001] HCA 30 at [68] , [73]-[74] and [91], Applicant A169/2003 v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 8 at [24] , WAEE v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 ; [2003] FCAFC 184 at [47] , Paul v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 113 FCR 396 ; [2001] FCA 1196.

Further, as the Minister submits, that in the circumstances of this case the Tribunal was not required to make further enquiries or seek further information in relation to the applicants' father's claimed support of the SDL, or even of the Reconciliation Bill. It is for an applicant to put forward his or her case, and to be given a reasonable opportunity to provide relevant material.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2008] FMCA 1690">For the reasons given above I am unable to say the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in the manner in which it reached its decision in this case. The Court does have some concern that so much of the decision was based upon the interview with the Department and was not the subject of direct questioning by the Tribunal. However, it has not been suggested in the application that the Tribunal had merely adopted the delegate's reasoning holus bolus and so failed to give "genuine and real consideration to the material before it"; SZEJF v Minister for Immigration [2006] FCA 724 at [55] . Even if it had been I do not think I could have come to such a conclusion because of the nature of the questions that were asked as evidenced by the transcript and the opportunity provided by the Tribunal in the s.424A letter for the applicant to deal with the concerns raised in the DIAC decision and interview. I dismiss the application. I order that the applicant pays the respondent's costs which I assess in the sum of $4,500.00. 
 I certify that the preceding twelve (12) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Raphael FM.

13 The appellant submitted that his Honour was too generous to the Tribunal. While it is true that the Tribunal has exposed its reasoning process as to why it considered the appellant's account to be implausible, the appellant submitted that it is this very reasoning process which is flawed. The Tribunal reasoned that it was not plausible for the appellant to escape the attention of the police by giving them an address that was 30 kilometres distant from where he actually lived. However, the appellant's submission is that the explanation was not implausible. The Tribunal simply asserted that it was and cited no evidence to support the reasoning. The appellant argued that to simply make an assertion to support a finding which does not otherwise flow from the material is simply not a sufficient basis: SZEJF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 724 at [59] ; Tran v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1229 at [17] .

This feature of the Tribunal's operation casts obligations upon it that are different from, and in some respects more onerous than, those applicable to more traditional bodies acting according to the more passive decision-making virtues of adversarial trial.

I accept the principle espoused but do not accept that the Tribunal erred in that manner.  Grounds 2 and 7 in the application were not pressed but the other grounds are pressed [2] . The applicants' written submissions are relevantly as follows: 
 
 
 Breach of section 414 Migration Act 1958 
 The Migration Act provides at s. 414(1) that if a valid application is made under section 412 for review of an RRT --- reviewable decision, the Tribunal must review the decision. Rares J. in SZEJF v MIMIA [2006] FCA 724 (9 June 2006) stated at para 38 'In exercising its function of conducting a review under s.414(1) of the Act the tribunal cannot simply act perfunctorily. Nor can it shut its ears or eyes so as to ignore, consciously or inadvertently, the claims made by the applicant for review'.
