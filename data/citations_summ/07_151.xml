<sentence id="cs2" from="[2011] WASC 107">22 A bare right of action cannot be assigned. A distinction has often been drawn between bare rights of action, on the one hand, and on the other, property rights. The distinction is discussed by Campbell C D, in 'An Examination of the Champertous Assignment of Bare Causes of Action' (1999) 27 Australian Business Law Review 142. The assignment of bare rights of action is prohibited but the assignment of property rights, including choses in action, are permitted. The right to sue for unliquidated damages or breach of contract is a bare right of action, not property. There is an exception to the rule that a bare right of action cannot be assigned. In Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 , 703 the House of Lords held that whilst a bare right of action cannot be assigned, an assignment is permitted if the assignment is of a property right or interest, and a cause of action is ancillary to that interest, or if the assignee had a genuine commercial interest in taking the assignment and enforcing it for his own benefit. The principle advanced in Trendtex has been followed in a number of first instance judgments in Australia: see Rickard Constructions Pty Ltd v Rickard Hails Moretti Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1041 ; (2004) 220 ALR 267 ; TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 [78] - [81]. However, the principle advanced in Trendtex is contrary to dicta of Williams, Webb and Kitto JJ in Poulton v The Commonwealth (1952) 89 CLR 540. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs4" from="[2011] NSWSC 205">In TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 Finkelstein J said [at 75 - 76] that: 
 
Although confidential information is not property and hence is not capable of being assigned, it now seems to be accepted that confidential information can be passed on by one person to another, and the person to whom it has been imparted can take action to protect the information. In O'Mustad &amp; Son v S Allcock &amp; Co Ltd (1928) 1B IPR 773 ; [1964] 1 WLR 109 the liquidator of a company sold to the appellant the company's business including the benefit of trade secrets. One of the former employees took up employment with a competitor, with the intention of passing on trade secrets to his new employer. The appellants obtained an injunction to restrain the disclosure. In Douglas v Hello! Ltd (No 2) [2006] QB 125 ; (2005) 65 IPR 449 ; [2005] 4 All ER 128 ; [2005] EWCA Civ 595 at [129] - [134] it was observed that the decision in O'Mustad &amp; Son "supports the proposition that a purchaser of confidential information can restrain disclosure of that information in breach of confidence, but again the picture is complicated by the fact that the benefit of [the employee's] contractual obligation not to disclose the information was purchased by Mustad. That may be a good explanation for the decision of the Law Lords but, even if the employment contract had not been assigned, in my opinion, consistent with principle, a "purchaser" of the confidential information is entitled to the court's protection . In the Spycatcher case ( Attorney-General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No 2) [1990] 1 AC 109 at 281) Lord Goff said: "a duty of confidence arises when confidential information comes to the knowledge of a person (the confidant) in circumstances where he has noticed ... that the information is confidential, with the effect that it would be just in all the circumstances that he should be precluded from disclosing the information to others. </sentence>

<sentence id="cs6" from="[2010] VSC 548">On balance, the preponderance of the admittedly sparse and relatively oblique indications by the High Court tends to throw doubt on, rather than affirm, that proposition. [306] In Trendtex [Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679] , the House of Lords considered that although the purported assignment of a cause of action (in relation to a dishonoured letter of credit) to a third party with no genuine and substantial interest in the success of the litigation was void for champerty, if the potential assignee had such an interest, the assignment of the bare right action would not offend the law against maintenance and champerty. [307] In TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) , [16] Finkelstein J held that confidential information, while not property "in any normal sense" or indeed property at all, but, rather, the subject matter of protection by equity by "the notion of an obligation of conscience ..." [17] was capable of assignment, particularly where it related to rights owned, or likely to be owned, by the assignee. His Honour stated: 
 
 
 
 
 'I said that the receivers "purported" to assign the causes of action for there is a general rule that a personal right to litigate cannot be assigned either at law or in equity, but an impersonal right in the nature of a proprietary right can be assigned provided the circumstances warrant it. Thus, it has been said that causes of action in tort, which are regarded as personal rights, cannot be assigned: Poulton v Commonwealth (1953) 89 CLR 540 at 571 and 602 ; [1954] ALR 1 at 7---8.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs8" from="[2010] FMCA 590">The applicant first claims compensatory damages under s.115(2) of the Copyright Act . In the applicant's helpful written submissions it notes that damages for breach of copyright "are to compensate the plaintiff for the loss which it has suffered as a result of the defendant's breach" ; Interfirm Comparison (Aust) Pty Limited v Law Society (NSW) (1975) 6 ALR 445 at 446 (Bowen CJ); Bailey v Namol Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1401 ; (1994) 53 FCR 102 at 111 (Burchett, Gummow and O'Loughlin JJ) and that the method of assessing damages is the licence fee (or royalty) method where the applicant recovers the sum equal to the fee that would fairly be charged for the use of the copyright work; Performing Rights Society Limited v Bradford Corp [1921] MacG Cop Cas 309 ; Stovin-Bradford v Volpoint Properties Ltd [1971] CH 1007 ; TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444. The respondent accepts this method as the appropriate one in the circumstances of this case.  In coming to my conclusion as to the quantum of additional damages I was reminded by the applicant that in APRA v Cougars Tavern &amp; Ors [2008] FMCA 369 I took into account the views expressed in a number of past cases. [8] He then helpfully referred to some cases not mentioned there and others of a more recent vintage. [9] The respondent submitted that the pecuniary damages in TS &amp; B Retail (supra) were calculated by reference to a sample and suggested that the amount of additional damages took into account the possibility that the pecuniary damages did not really reflect the extent of the infringement whereas in the instant case the exact extent of the infringement was known by virtue of the evidence of Ms Tang. The respondent noted that the Elwood Clothing Pty Ltd v Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 633 ; (2009) 81 IPR 378 case was a counterfeiting operation and that in Rutter v Brooklyn Valley Estate Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 702 ; (2009) 81 IPR 549 there was a long-term series of infringement from 1999 onwards until judgment. The Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1495 ; (2009) 84 IPR 222 decision was also one involving a long-term full scale counterfeiting operation. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2010] FCA 694">Of course, Flashback was bound to elect between pursuing damages and an account of profits --- s 115(2). At the outset of the damages trial its counsel did so and elected to pursue damages. I take as a useful summary of the relevant principles for an assessment of damages under s 115(2) the reasons of Finkelstein J in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 at 495-496 [203] - [208]. For present purposes his Honour's analysis contains seven points of relevance. One way of describing the measure of damages for copyright infringement is as the depreciation caused by the infringement to the value of the copyright as a chose in action.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs10" from="[2010] FCAFC 55">381 The uncertain state of the law as revealed by these three Full Court authorities (particularly Allen Manufacturing and Cooper ) is reflected in judgments of single members of the court. As noted above, Finkelstein J had to deal with the problem in Root Quality , and, after a very comprehensive review of the cases, his Honour formulated the test to which I have referred. In another judgment about seven years later, TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 , Finkelstein J considered the problem again, and stated that he was not persuaded that his approach in Root Quality had been in error (158 FCR at 491 [186]).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs11" from="[2010] FCAFC 56">35 Although confidential information is not property in the usual sense, it may be transferred by one person to another and the person to whom it is transferred has standing to take action to protect the confidentiality of the information. The Court may therefore grant at the behest of the person to whom, as a purchaser, the confidential information is transferred, injunctions and equitable compensation for breaches of the confidence (see TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 at [72] - [77]). His Honour therefore concluded that it was not necessary that PIV Antrieb be joined as a party. His Honour was satisfied that Elecon Engineering had breached the obligation of confidence that it owed to PIV Drives and that both it and Elecon Australia may be restrained, at least in Australia, from further breach of that confidence. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs12" from="[2010] VSCA 1">307 In TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd and Ors (No 3), [215] Finkelstein J held that confidential information, while not property 'in any normal sense' or indeed property at all, but, rather, the subject matter of protection by equity by 'the notion of an obligation of conscience ...

Finkelstein J there thus summarised the position as follows: 
 
 Joint tortfeasors 
 

 
 
 [177] The common law rule is that one tort may be committed by two or more persons: they are usually referred to as joint tortfeasors. Although the term is commonly used, the concept is not well defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs14" from="[2009] FCA 1327">In TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 , Finkelstein J decided that although confidential information was not property in the usual sense it may be passed by one person to another and the person to whom it had been imparted can take action to protect the information. His Honour concluded that this Court may grant both injunctions and equitable compensation in a cause of action for breach of confidence (see at [72]-[77]). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs15" from="[2009] FCA 1298">This method of assessment focuses on an applicant's lost profit. The method was explained by Finkelstein J in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 at 495-6 as follows: 
 
 "The plaintiff must show that he has lost sales to the defendant as a result of the infringement and quantify the loss suffered. This requires the court to explore the counter factual hypothesis of the contracts the plaintiff would have obtained absent the infringement and the costs associated with them. Necessarily the process will involve a degree of speculation, but that is no bar to recovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs16" from="[2009] VSC 508">Even if one accepted, consistent with Trendtex and contrary to the clear statement of principle in Poulton, that a cause of action in tort or pursuant to statute (such as the TPA or FTA) can be assigned, the assignee still needs to demonstrate a genuine substantial interest or a genuine commercial interest in maintaining the cause of action and that the interest existed prior to the assignment. See Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; [2006] 236 ALR 720. But compare TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3 Fold Resources [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444.

<sentence id="cs17" from="[2009] FCA 773">The reason that statutory causes of action have been held not to be assignable is attributable to the distinction between personal causes of action and an impersonal right in the nature of a proprietary right. As Rares J stated in Boston Commercial Services 236 ALR at 733, "[o]nly a person who suffers loss or damage by the conduct done in contravention of a relevant provision of the [TPA] can recover under s 82 ". This distinction is well established: see Poulton v Commonwealth (1952) 89 CLR 540 at 571 per Fullagar J (and on appeal at 602 per Williams, Webb and Kitto JJ); Trendtex [1982] AC at 702 per Lord Roskill; TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 at 465 per Finkelstein J. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs18" from="[2009] FCA 633">Where, as here, the Applicant and the Respondent are in actual or potential competition, the appropriate measure of damage was described by Finkelstein J in TS &amp; B [2007] FCA 151 ; 158 FCR 444 at [207] as follows: 
Then lost profit is usually the best measure of damage. The plaintiff must show that he has lost sales to the defendant as a result of the infringement and quantify the loss suffered. This requires the court to explore the counterfactual hypothesis of the contracts the plaintiff would have obtained absent the infringement and the costs associated with them . As earlier described (see [5] and [6] above), an award of general damages is to be that sum which will put the Applicant in the same position as it would have been in if it had not suffered the wrong. There is no dispute that, subject to issues of causation and foreseeability, any secondary loss, including damage to reputation, caused by the infringement is recoverable: TS &amp; B [2007] FCA 151 ; 158 FCR 444 at [207] - [208].  Various methods of measuring damages for infringement of copyright have been described: see Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2) (2008) 76 IPR 763 at [11] and TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 at [204] - [209].  In the present case, the evidence establishes that the Applicant's sales did in fact cease when the Respondent's infringing product entered the market place. However, as Finkelstein J noted in TS &amp; B [2007] FCA 151 ; 158 FCR 444 (see [11] above), that finding is only part of the process in calculating damages. As the Court acknowledged in Bailey 53 FCR at 111-112, the lost profits assessment depends upon a counterfactual and it is here that in this case the evidence of the other integers is lacking. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs19" from="[2008] FCA 1493">30 What then is the proper method for calculating the amount of loss caused by the infringement? Various methods of measuring damages for infringement of copyright have been described: see Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 746 at [11] and TS&amp;B Retail Systems Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 151 ; 158 FCR 444 at [204] - [209] .  22 In TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 at [177] - [178] , Finkelstein J described joint tortfeasors in the following terms:
 
 
 The common law rule is that one tort may be committed by two or more persons: they are usually referred to as joint tortfeasors. Although the term is commonly used, the concept is not well defined. To be joint tortfeasors it is not sufficient that the independent wrongful acts of two persons have caused the same damage.</sentence>

<sentence id="cs21" from="[2008] FCA 1375">14 I accept that, as the applicants maintain, the provision to a student of an infringing copy of an Icarus College practice exam was an actionable conversion, the measure of damages being the market value of the exam. So calculated, conversion damages may be awarded under s 116. The applicants accept that, on this analysis, damages under s 115(2) would be confined to indirect losses, such as the diminution of goodwill or any loss associated with the failure to enhance goodwill or reputation: see TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 at 496 per Finkelstein J and Prior v Sheldon [2000] FCA 438 ; (2000) 48 IPR 301 at 321-22 per Wilcox J. This would apparently prevent any overlap of the kind that s 116(1C) is intended to avoid. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs22" from="[2008] FCA 938">80 The same onus submission was made in relation to defects the appellant submitted existed in the program. The respondent disputed their existence. The appellant contended that the burden was on the respondent to prove there were no defects. Reliance was placed on TSB Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 72 IPR 492 at [125] . That was an infringement case. One of the defences was that the respondent was authorised to reproduce the drawings there in question. Finkelstein J said that the copyright owner had the onus of proving the absence of authorisation "for that is an element of the cause of action for copyright infringement".</sentence>
<sentence id="cs23" from="[2008] FCA 377">31 The decision of Finkelstein J in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 may be seen as an example of the category of connection with property. There, the assignment of a cause of action for breach of confidential information, connected with or relating to rights of property that were assigned, was upheld (see particularly [2007] FCA 151 ; 158 FCR 444 at [79] ---[81]). However, that decision, and others since 1982, have been influenced by dicta of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 indicating another basis for exception from the general rule --- whether the assignee has a "genuine and substantial interest in the success of the ... litigation" (per Lord Wilberforce at 694D) or has a "genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of the claim of another" (per Lord Roskill at 703D). 33 Finkelstein J took the wider view in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 151 ; 158 FCR 444 and suggested that the High Court in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; (2006) 229 CLR 386 had approved the effect of the statements by Lords Wilberforce and Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679. The precise point that arises here did not arise in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; 229 CLR 386. However, the reasoning of Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ at [68]---[82] and Callinan and Heydon JJ at [258]---[261] supports the opinion of Finkelstein J. In my opinion, the principle enunciated in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 can be taken to be established for Australia. It needs to be borne in mind that the statement in Poulton 89 CLR 540 was not the centre of controversy in that case. 31 The decision of Finkelstein J in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 may be seen as an example of the category of connection with property. There, the assignment of a cause of action for breach of confidential information, connected with or relating to rights of property that were assigned, was upheld (see particularly [2007] FCA 151 ; 158 FCR 444 at [79] ---[81]). However, that decision, and others since 1982, have been influenced by dicta of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 indicating another basis for exception from the general rule --- whether the assignee has a "genuine and substantial interest in the success of the ... litigation" (per Lord Wilberforce at 694D) or has a "genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of the claim of another" (per Lord Roskill at 703D).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs24" from="[2007] FCA 1532">117 Subsequent to Rickard Constructions , passing reference was made to the issue by Finkelstein J in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No. 3) [2007] FCA 151 ; (2007) 158 FCR 444 at [78] - [81] . Once again, the brief discussion was dicta and, unsurprisingly, was inconclusive on the subject. His Honour observed that, in Campbells Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; (2006) 229 ALR 58 , the High Court may have recently approved Trendtex . But that observation is of doubtful application to circumstances such as those of the present case. In Fostif , the High Court was not concerned with the validity of a purported assignment of a cause of action but rather whether an action should be stayed as an abuse of process because of the existence of a litigation funding arrangement between the plaintiffs and a firm of consultants. The appeal to the High Court was allowed on a quite separate basis, and the question of the validity of the assignment of a cause of action was nowhere considered.</sentence>
